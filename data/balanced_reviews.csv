"I rarely type reviews but simply have to after trying this product. I picked it up at Whole Foods and yes, the color is kinda strange, but I can get past that. And I realized it wouldn't taste truly like ice cream. But it has such a sickeningly sweet flavor that is nothing like cookies and cream. It reminded me of cheap ice milk with a bunch of Equal packets mixed in. And I did assume there would be 'cookies'. I know that there are whey crisps out on the market and assumed that something similar would be used.<br /><br />Overall, I really hated this product and after trying to doctor it up, I just threw it away. It's not a remotely good ice cream substitute. If you're looking for a natural, low sugar option, try So Delicious No-Sugar Added Coconut Milk Ice Cream.

I would still question even that though, knowing how difficult this stuff is to wash out.<br /><br /> With no instructions with it there's no telling how exactly to use this.  As a former hairstylist, I've seen similar looking products used on straightened hair to help smooth it down with a flat iron, but  It's not advertised to use that way.<br />It's thick and by the other reviewers seems to be very difficult them to wash out too.

Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.

"The only reason I bought this was because I could buy it with a special 50% discount, therefore getting 6 boxes of it at half price of $ 20.80 seemed to be a good deal to me.  How wrong I was!  I was surprised to see its price jumped up to $ 22.15 when I wrote this review (cheaper when buy it via subscribe and save) which comes to about $ 3.69 a box, still cheaper than its price of $ 3.99 (plus sales tax) in my local Target.  However, the problem was when I opened its BIG box up, there were only five tiny packages: a small pack of hummus dip, a small pack of multi-seed crackers, a small pack (0.75 oz) of fruit and nut mix, a small pack of Dry Roasted Edamame and a very tiny (0.43 oz) roast dark 60% cacao organic dark chocolate.  Unless you eat like a bird, there is no way this box can serve as anything but a snack, a very small one.<br /><br />(1) Hummus dip and multi-seed crackers - there is 13 gram of fat (3 gram saturated fat) in the hummus dip, however the biggest problem is its large content of salt (450 gm sodium).  It tasted so salty (bitter) that it completely ruined the taste of the hummus.  If you eat this dip everyday, you would have high blood pressure for sure.  Now the crackers are quite good but there are really only a few of them.<br /><br />(2)Baja Blend fruit nut mix - I was surprised to see it has 5 gm of fat and 9 gm of sugar in such a tiny bag (0.75 oz or 21 gm).  It tastes quite sweet, a little bit tart and wow, spicy HOT! It burned my tongue.  A very strange mix, not too bad but very unusual and I am not sure I want to repeat the experience. I could not figure out where the hot spice comes from even after I read its package repeatedly.<br /><br />(3) Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame - quite healthy, only 150 gm of sodium and 4 gm fat (0.5 gm saturated).  It tasted pretty good but no different than any roasted edamame you can buy yourself.  It would be much cheaper.<br /><br />(4)Chocolate - yes, its is supposed to be organic, but strange enough it will not tell you how much sugar or fat it has.  The chocolate piece's outside is also whitish, to me that may be a sign of the chocolate becomes too old or? How does it taste? It taste like anything but chocolate.  I do not believe I can eat more than a bite of it.<br /><br />Therefore, not trying to bad mouth this product, but why would I want to pay about $ 3.69 to pay for a box of something that is not healthy, not filling, not tasting good unless, well, you want to lose weight.  I believe if you would eat it as your meals everyday, you will be almost guaranteed to lose weight because you would simply discard the whole box before you can finish them and will still feel hungry.","Unhealthy, unfilling and expensive!",1

"Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first.

"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity.

"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky.

"I was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & I'm always eying up new flavors to try out. This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.<br /><br />The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.<br /><br />The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things ""watermelon"" or ""strawberry"" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.<br /><br />One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention ""organic"" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have ""made with organic ingredients"" on it, just ""made with organic sugar"". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this. This has to be the first licorice product that has remained unfinished in my house ever.","They're OK, but not great.",1

"I ordered these kabobs for my very picky Havanese. I used them as his special bedtime treat (after teeth brushing).  The kabobs in the first six bags I ordered looked just like the picture (like chicken treats wrapped around a stick) and my dog loved them.  The sticks in the first two batches were about 4 inches long and I broke the treats in half.  I just received my third batch of three bags.  They look horrible and nothing like the picture (in fact they don't even look like chicken!).  The sticks are about 2 to 2-1/2 inches long (not long enough to break).  My dog turned his nose up at what used to be his very favorite bedtime treat.  What makes it worse, is that when I read the description on the bag, there's a warning to wash your hands after handling and something about the treats being exposed to radiation for your safety.  I have no idea what that means, but safety and radiation in the same sentence seems contradictory to me and a bit scary, and of course I don't have the bags from the first orders to compare to this most recent order.  I will not order these treats again.  What a shame.",First batch was great,1

"I decided to try this food as part of the Vine Program for my schnauzer.  Manufacturers can say anything they want and the burden of proof is on you (the consumer).  In the end, what you choose to feed your dog boils down to whether the dog likes the food, the food's nutritional content and ingredients and the track record of the dog food manufacturer.<br /><br />The 15.5 pound bag is a good size, and there is a zip top for re-sealing the bag.  I kept mine in a large plastic container for additional freshness.  One of the first things I did was review the ingredient list.  This product starts with ground yellow corn (not digestible by dogs), followed by chicken by-product meal.  We all know what chicken-by product is, so I won't go there, but keep in mind that this is ""pet grade"" meat by-product.  Corn gluten and wheat/rice/soy flour are fillers or binders and offer little nutritional value.  Beef tallow preserved with mixed tocopherols is an ingredient used to make dog food palatable to dogs.  It is essentially rendered cow fat, the same kind used to make soap and candles.  I am happy to see beef listed in the ingredients, but unhappy to see sorbitol and sugar.  Tricalcium phosphate is an anti-caking agent that supplies some calcium.  Animal digest is another form of rendered animal tissue for flavoring.  I noted quite a few preservatives in this food as well: sorbic acid, calcium propionate.  There are also a lot of added colors and dl-methionine which is given to dogs to keep the pH of their urine from damaging grass.  Finally, there is an amino acid derivative (Lysine) and some dried vegetables and vitamins thrown in for good measure.  I suppose the addition of these ingredients make the food a source of ""balanced nutrition.""<br /><br />Although my schnauzer would eat most anything, and it would be easy for me to write a review that says how much my dog loved devouring this food, I cannot overlook the ingredients.  The ingredients are low quality, and many or most of them have been linked to one allergy or another.  As for Purina, their track record is also something I would suggest you research.  This product is OK if you aren't concerned with what you feed your dog, or if you are in a situation that prevents you from buying more expensive alternatives.  I would add the gentle suggestion that it may be more cost effective to provide your dog with a better source of nutrition to prevent costly vet bills down the road.  I would recommend going to a pet type store and checking out the alternatives.  You might be surprised that for a few bucks more you can get a dog food with a much better ingredient list.  And if you're like me and the dog is part of the family, you will be better off in the long run.",Is this really beneficial for your dog?,1

"I have been an avid fan of these cookies for years.  My family went through dozens of boxes a month for our use, taking to functions as our donation, giving as gifts.  They were a dark, rich, wholesome, deep taste experience.  In May, 2012, I couldn't find them on the shelf in any of our normal stores.  After a few weeks, they were back.  I took them home and opened them and was surprised to find that the inside container was different.  It used to be three rows that ran the short end of the box.  Now it was two rows that ran the long end of the box.  No big deal had that been all that changed.  I took a cookie out and popped it in my mouth expected the same dark, rich, wholesome experience, and the cookie tasted so bad I almost threw up.  It was sickly sweet.  It tasted like a combination between an oreo and a health food bar.  All they did was move to the middle ground where those who like health food bars won't like the oreo sweet taste and those who like oreos won't like the health food bar taste.  They are awful.  And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.  Now that they changed the recipe, none of us will ever be buying them again.  They are now the worst cookie I have ever tasted.",Changed the Recipe - Tates Horrible Now,1

"To start with, these bags do NOT contain 70 treat packs.  They contain 65 treat packs.  I checked more than one bag, and the shortage seems to be consistent.  The packs themselves are skimpy.  Some only contained 4 or 5 pieces of candy corn.  Packs available from other sources are much more generous in their content.  So, if you are satisfied with a short count of skimpy treats, I suppose you might buy these, but I like a little more for my money.<br /><br />Note: Since posting this earlier review, the company seems to have corrected the shortage problem (I counted the contents of a bag purchased this year).  The individual packetts are still on the skimpy size.  There were some extra packetts, so if you discard the ones with only three or four pieces of candy corn, you might end up with 70 that each have about 7 pieces of candy corn.  That compares with a different source that has packetts with about 14 pieces of candy corn (at a somewhat higher price).",Not recommended,1

"This is a shame. When Merricks introduced its canned cat foods, they were truly out-standing.  There was no filler of excess liver, no bone, no cartlidge, no cheap grindings swimming in gravy--things which are typical of the majority of cat food producers.  There was minimum grain and lots of turkey, in addition to the obvious nutritious veggies and berries. Merricks truly was the King. However, as I continued to buy over time, I noticed a distinct degrading of quality.  I usually buy directly from the company's website so I addressed these issues to them the day I found chunks of obvious poulty vertabra and cartlidge, large chunks--whole vertabra bones-- and ground, in a particular lot.  I had already seen the qualities of the foods going downhill but this addition of bone and cartlidge was upsetting. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and wrote to inform them that perhaps an ""accident"" had happened. They were cold, uncaring and wanted my remaining cans after I send them photographs of the foods, bones and cartlige matter and cans with the lot numbers clearly stamped. I admit I blew my stack at this attitude, but the last straw was receiving the final lot(which unfortunately I had ordered before the discovery of the literal garbage in the previous lot) and the result of the new came pouring out of the cans in a gray-ish brown mass of ""gravy"", with no visible pieces of turkey, just unhealthy-looking masses of liver and some cheap ground poultry that was hard and brittle to the fingers.  Merricks has been informed that they have a problem with quality control and the customer should be very aware that the lots differ dramatically. I'm very glad I kept and presevered the cans, bones and photographs as proof. If you want to pay premium prices for the kind of crap you throw away in your garbage every day then by all means buy Merricks and take a chance.

Why have a picture of cherries on the bag?  They should just say fruit topping mix.<br /><br />I went to the Julia's Pantry website where they advertised six different cobbler mixes.  Upon reading the instructions for each of them, I saw that they actually are identical --  put a can of your own {strawberries, blackberries, apples, peaches, cherries, or blueberries} in a dish, sprinkle the cobbler mix on top, add milk and bake.  Of course, none of this information was on the Amazon listing.<br /><br />If you only want the topping, then this might be for you.  But do not buy it if you expect to be able to make a complete cobbler from the box.",Misrepresented,1

And more to that, as I was reading the nutrition label, the second most thing that was added as its ingredients? ""high fructose corn syrup"". Another big thing was partially hydrogenated soybean oils. Those two must be regulated and possibly BANNED. Of course, manufacturers still use those because using partially hydrogenated oil is much cheaper than using other kinds of oils that are still avaiable out there today.

"Yes, I did smell the vanilla (and even saw it) when I opened the bag and pour the contents out. However, once the coffee was made, the taste was a disappointment to myself. Perhaps I got used to another coffee which was much more to my liking. In any case, not only did this coffee taste bitter to me, but the vanilla taste was weaker than I expected (again, this is in comparison to another vanilla-flavored coffee I've had, which gave me a stronger vanilla ""experience""). This Starbucks product is pretty strong coffee (the instructions tell you to use 2 TBS of ground coffee for 6 ounces of water) and to my taste - seems quite bitter if I follow their instructions. However, once I add some milk to it, the bitterness is masked somewhat - but I would not drink this black if I have a choice.

The claim is SEA Salt, whatever that is;  I know I wouldn't drink sea water, so why would I like SEA Salt.  The cashews are hot and spicy and overall, the heavy seasonings take away the original flavor, and without original flavor you have something completely different.<br /><br />Cashews generally are a good source of snacks and these have no transfat which is good.

First, I received an email that my orders had been cancelled.  No explanation, just cancelled.  When I emailed to inquire what was going on, I got an email back saying that the items were being shipped by a quicker service, so I could receive the gumballs in time for Christmas (to go with the gumball machine that I purchased as a gift).  Great!  Then, two days later, I get an email from Amazon stating that my gumballs had shipped on that day, the 22nd, and not on the 18th, the date the Candy Depot stated they had shipped the item.  So, on Christmas day, there will be a gumball machine, but no gumballs.  Of course, if the Candy Depot had been honest, or at least not totally incompetitent, I could have gone out locally and gotten some.  But, alas, too late.  By the way, when I got the Amazon shipment notification, I again emailed The Candy Depot to ask what was going on, forwarding to them their email stating they had shipped on the 18th and asking what was going on.

"Amazon doesn't allow zero star reviews...and the one star I had to allow is far too generous.  This product deserves about a negative 10 star designation.  It is not organic (one reviewer described finding it in the ""organic"" section of their local grocery store).  The label on the bag claims ""100% pure & natural granola"" (this claim is meaningless) and on the back has the following:<br />""No artificial flavors; No cholesterol; No hydrogenated oils; No high fructose corn syrup; No artificial preservatives; 0 g trans fat""<br /><br />Notice it does NOT claim to be GMO-free and the likelihood is that this granola DOES contain GMOs, as it has non-organic canola oil.  Please be aware that ""Bear Naked"" is not some folksy brand - it is a subsidiary of Kelloggs...the same Kelloggs that has donated substantial amounts of money to defeat a California November 6th Right-to-Know Ballot Initiative (Proposition 37) that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods and would, in the words of the Organic Consumers Organization put ""an end to the unethical practice, unfortunately common even in the alternative food sector, of marketing or labeling GMO-tainted food as ""natural.""<br /><br />The group GMO Free USA, has launched campaign #1: Boycott Kelloggs, noting ""In this digital age, you have to wonder why a company would spend more money than it could possibly cost to change their product labels to fight against the consumer's right to know what we are eating.""<br /><br />Why, they might even have to label a seemingly ""clean"" brand like Bear Naked with the truth...and then how much of this phony product would they sell?

"As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three ""issues"" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the ""rope"" & ""wet hemp bracelet"" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the ""organic"" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.

Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE"">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got ""no aspartame""--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this ""tea mix,"" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness (""natural flavors,"" ""made with real ingredients,"" ""tea & honey,"" ""real fruit flavors"") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: ""sweetened with honey."" Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as ""Honey granules (sugar, honey),"" which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton.",Don't be fooled,1

"We bought these bottles about 1month ago. Our daughter is very picky about bottles a chokes on many nipples. She is breastfed, but we needed to start introducing bottles for daycare.

"I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well, it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff!

"Years ago, when I had what seemed like an eternal cold, I read that if one takes hot sauce, it helps clear out the bronchial tubes.  I got a bottle of Dave's Insanity Sauce from a health food store (?!), brought it home and took about half a teaspoon of it with some salad.  About 15 minutes later, I was writhing in agony on the bathroom floor and semi-conscious.  My husband called an ambulance, and the last thing I remembered was a medic saying, ""I can't get a pulse.""<br />My husband took the jar of sauce along to the hospital -- the ER doctor said to me later, ""My brother eats this stuff, but they make him sign for it when he buys it.""  I thought he was kidding, but he assured me he wasn't kidding.<br />There were no permanent after-effects.  My husband said it was the first time he'd ever seen me take anything without reading the label first -- turns out the label said to put only a few drops on the food -- and I took half a teaspoon.

"By the title, you should get the hint of what this product is all about. First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a bloody diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(bloody mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone.<br /><br />I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the ""new"" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type.<br /><br />This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog.

I won't go on and on about how much I dislike it, and it's all personal taste, but I like strong coffee and this is strong...in the wrong way. It tastes like burnt cigarettes smell. Like cigarette butts. And its aroma matches, making this non-smoker's house smell like a lounge. It is thick as tar and even if diluted with water, still retains a burnt ash taste that coats the inside of my mouth.

"This gum have is an outrage!  It worst than Coke Cola.<br /><br />  ""When launched Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were cocaine (benzoylmethyl ecgonine) and caffeine. The cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut, leading to the name Coca-Cola (the ""K"" in Kola was replaced with a ""C"" for marketing purposes).[29][30]<br />Coca -- cocaine<br /><br />Pemberton called for five ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup, a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola did once contain an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass, but in 1903 it was removed.[31] Coca-Cola still contains coca flavoring.""<br /><br />I have read in Wikipedia, that Pemberton was a morphine junkie.  This man, a junkie, was allowed to formulate the formula for coca cola.  What a low down standard. I know when someone is hooked on something, they don't know the different between right and wrong, healthy and unhealthy and cannot be trusted.  It is a fact, that drug addicts are contagious, they spread diseases and just being around they bad behavior cause other people (who are not skilled to treat) to use bad drugs too.  Even thought this drink was latter said to be ""kosher"" by a rabbi.  I still will not drink it because the acid contain is so high it can dissolve a nail and the manufacturers of Coke Cola cannot put enough distance between me and the words cocaine free cola leaf.<br /><br />People happily smacking on this gum today, shows how America values have deteriorated over the last 100 years.

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk.

The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

"Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.",Bait and switch!,1

"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.",Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!,1

The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray.

When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product.

If you ignore its slightly (oddly) medicinal smell and actually consume this product, you'll wish you hadn't. The taste? Think less peanut butter, more roasted peanut-flavored glue. Low calorie/low fat? Absolutely; especially since I couldn't stand to choke down more than a few bites. In the end, I opted to go without lunch rather than eat my Better'n Peanut Butter sandwich.<br /><br />As a vegetarian who commonly shops at natural food stores/in natural food sections and who is always looking for low calorie foods, I can generally handle ""alternative"" flavors. I drink rice milk. I eat imitation chicken (soy based). I use whole wheat items whenever possible. So while I was not at all expecting Better'n Peanut Butter to fully live up to it's name, I at least thought it may come close to matching the taste of the real thing (I've eaten the low fat versions of Jif and Skippy peanut butter for years and actually prefer them over their full-fat predecessors). I couldn't have been more wrong.",Low calorie/low fat because it's unbearable to eat,1
"For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.

"The charming picture on the box was reminiscent of the more special momments in your childhood. Unfortunately, the crude sludge contained within was not as enjoyable. With an odor which served only to offend my delicate nasal passages, slightly akin to that of burning vaseline. The taste was generally harsh, and burned my palate. A taste which one could only relate to stale nachos and burning pig ovaries. The texture could only be comparable to liquified chalk, with a hint of sand. An after taste of goat rectum and pepto bismal lingered in my throat, only going away with copious amounts of whiskey. I denounce this drink.

I eat alot of organic foods and health foods but this has to be one of the worst tasting food items I've tried.  Maybe it taste better toasted but I was under the impression you could make sandwhiches with it.  I like my them untoasted.  Do you want to know what this tast like? It taste like soft sawdust.  I'm not kidding you.  I will try their other bread but this was aweful.  Please consider changing the recipe.  The bread breaks apart easily and has ruined what ever I've eated with it.

In order to fairly evaluate the product, I added it to my own turkey and cheese sandwich wrap. (It is not a low-cal condiment.) I'm sorry to say...I agree wholeheartedly with the boys.

"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil.

"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.","False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!",1

"We've been feeding this to our Great Dane and honestly it hasn't worked out too well.<br /><br />Our dog is just over a year old and at her annual vet visit the vet pointed out that she was developing a yeast infection in her ear.  He told me it was most likely from her food and asked what we feed her.  I told him we feed her IAMS Large Breed food, and he said that it was probably the problem.<br /><br />He said we didn't need to treat it at the level that it was at, but that if she got to where she was shaking her ears a lot, or pawing at them, or if we noticed other symptoms, we would want to try a better diet to see if it fixed it.<br /><br />So, our dog's ears got worse.  She was constantly shaking her ears.  Her skin developed really bad dandruff.  She used to be really obedient, but she became really naughty.  I called the vet's office and we're switching her to a wheat-free corn-free diet now.  Last week we transitioned her over and this week we have already seen a little improvement; she doesn't shake her ears much at all anymore.  We'll watch and see if the dandruff and behavior problems also go away.  I am hopeful that they will.<br /><br />Maybe some dogs can eat this and be fine--our dog LIKES eating IAMS food...but it's just really obvious that it hasn't been good for her.  Until her vet told me, I had no idea that dog foods have so much bad stuff in them.  Dogs are carnivores, so it makes sense that they have problems on a wheat and corn diet.  The vet didn't try to sell us any particular brand of food, he just suggested trying a wheat and corn free brand for a couple months to see how it goes.  We are trying Nutro Natural Choice now.<br /><br />Too bad.  $50-60/bag dog food for a Great Dane is going to add up.",Not very good.,1

"Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!!<br />if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it.<br /><br />Here is our story.<br />My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to.<br />We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.<br /><br />We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu.<br />However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time.<br />I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged.<br />As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.<br /><br />Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews).<br />I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!<br /><br />And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.<br /><br />My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.<br /><br />Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it.<br />My wife and I are now happy again :)",This milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(,1

"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes.

"I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these.  However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google ""pill pockets diarrhea"", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.","Be careful, made 1 of my dogs very ill",1

"Unfortunately, Gerber is using tuna oil as a source of DHA. This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil.",Not environmentally friendly!,1

"I buy this brand from a local store in bulk.  I was trying to save myself some time and hassle by buying it through Amazon (about same price either way as my local store).  But after this shipment (and a totally separate different food item shipped from Amazon *on the same order* that also had health/quality issues), I cannot recommend buying this from Amazon.<br /><br />I was sent the case pack, wrapped in heavy plastic which was packaged neatly in a cardboard box.  When I pulled out the plastic-wrapped case, it was extremely obvious that these cans had burst... and had done so some time ago b/c an enormous amount of black mold had grown inside the plastic wrap.  Why this wasn't caught by their people, I don't know.  (I'm on ""prime""; so, I get my shipments in 2 days or less...not enough time to have the mold grow that much.)<br /><br />Anyway, I did open the plastic surrounding the case of cans to inspect further.  I found that at least 4 cans had burst, and, of course, the stench was horrible.  I tossed the entire batch in the garbage.  There was no way I was chancing my family's health on this one.<br /><br />NOTE: (1) This item was fulfilled by Amazon, not a different seller.  (2) The boxes in which these were shipped was not damaged, not even a small dent.  (3) The cans were not dented, either.  This case was not damaged during shipment.  Whatever caused the cans to burst appears to be the result of an error during ""Farmer's Market"" manufacturing.  Furthermore, my assertion is that Amazon's people should have noticed the obvious black mold.<br /><br />[Edited to add: Initially (and after talking briefly with a doctor/scientist about these cans), I was given the impression that the burst cans were a result of botulism.  The scientist is the one who used that term with me b/c it had not occurred to me prior to the conversation.  Alarmed, I used the term in my original review w/o referencing the aforementioned conversation.  I have since removed the term.  Regardless, black mold is toxic (more so than green molds), and this experience was health and safety issue.]<br /><br />I will say that Amazon did give me my money back without a major hassle.<br /><br />In my experience WRT household/grocery items, it appears that Amazon gets good pricing from companies for stuff that doesn't meet that company's upper level quality control standards.  Besides all the great books, toys, electronics and more, I order several household items from Amazon.  Most of the items in this ""household/grocery"" category aren't edible/food items. I do notice minor differences in quality on these other household items.  For the most part, I can overlook them.  But on food?  No way.<br /><br />(To be clear: Other items such as books, electronics, toys have usually been just fine.)<br /><br />To sum up, when I say ""tread warily"" I'm suggesting that you just be careful and pay closer attention than you otherwise would when you order this (and perhaps other food items) from Amazon.<br /><br />Your experience may vary, and I hope it does.","Brand is otherwise great, but Amazon sent me a batch with Black Mold",1

"Of the other Lavazza coffees we've tried our opinion of them goes from very good to excellent so I did not hesitate to buy a can of Lavazza ""drip coffee"" when we needed a can of coffee in a hurry. A mistake.<br />The first thing you notice when you open the can is the color of the coffee - it's more of a cinnamon color, has an uneven course grind and looks very, very dry. After brewing a pot we found the flavor to be just awful.

"When Tony Roma's opened his wonderful restaurant on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami Beach, Florida I was an immediate fan.  I thought I had surely died and gone to heaven every time I ordered a full rack of Baby Back Ribs.  There were no ""heat"" or flavor choices...he only had one sauce then and it's not this one.  It was the very best of the best I've ever eaten and I enjoyed them for many years.  Even when he and his partner, Bobby Rubino split up, and Rubino opened his own rib place I sampled those and knew they had shared the recipe for this scrumptious delight.  The sauce they tout as original here is by far and no where near the original taste. This is a tad worse than ordinary and not worthy of the baby back ribs I purchased especially for this sauce!  I even cooked the rack in two different ways.  I split it in half, wrapped them in loose foil, and slow roasted them in a 250 degree oven then browned them off at the end and I marinated the other half, steamed them through and browned them off as well.  Roma's had an open rotating grill on which the ribs were browned off for final presentation and eating.  Tender...yes!  The slow cooking did that but that taste...that taste I remember so well was absolutely absent from the meat.  Don't waste your money or ribs on this.",This Is NOT The Original BBQ Sauce,1

"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.",Changed the ingredients to now include meat products!

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot.

The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

"Words cannot describe the nasty aftertaste in my mouth right now after just having finished one of these cookies. I am currently wracking my brain thinking what I have in the house that might get rid of this taste (other than brushing my teeth). Ugh. Basically, these are the regular soft Chips Ahoy cookies with a chocolate filling. It's not a gooey filling that spreads out of the cookie when broken open like the picture on the package implies. The filling just sticks inside the cookie and stays there when you break it in half. Not gooey at all (though I'm not even sure that would have helped). The flavor is totally artificial and sickeningly sweet with, as I have already mentioned, a very nasty aftertaste that lingers. My husband had pretty much the same response as I did when he tried the cookies.

"I ordered this product along with another brand of coconut oil and six CD's. I arrived home to find an oil soaked box sitting on top of my mail box (I was away from home 2 hrs during which the mail was delivered) ....the temp was almost 100 degrees.  I opened the box to find a huge mess!  The other brand oil was enclosed in a sealed plastic bag that was dry inside even though the oil itself was liquified....when I removed the lid, the seal on the top was completely intact.<br /><br />This product, however, was put in the box loose.  The plastic jar seal was unbroken but the lid turned easily so I could clearly see how the liquified oil had come out and gotten all over the interior of the box.....including the six CD's....with oil seeping up into their plastic coverings and onto the paper jackets.  When I broke the plastic ""ring"" that is supposed to seal the outside of the jar, I found that the seal on the top was not secured to the top but had come loose so the oil came out and under the loose top.....since it wasn't in a bag, it went everywhere in the box.  This was a packaging DISASTER all around!!!!<br /><br />I found this order didn't ""qualify"" for leaving feedback under the packaging feedback tab in the order category.......so I can only assume it is the seller's responsibility; and the inner seal does definitely need to be addressed by them.  The oil tastes fine but I certainly will never order again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was gratified to find that Amazon reads these reviews and reacts to them....after posting this review, I received an email apologizing for my experience and advising that I would receive a replacement for the Barlean's.  I did receive the Barlean's which arrived with no problem; it was packed the same way but was sent two-day shipping so didn't sit in any heat for extended times....also, this jar didn't have the failed seal under the lid when I opened it.  I appreciate and was impressed by Amazon's response but, to be honest, I have to wonder if when regularly shipped it still wouldn't be a problem since it's not enclosed in a plastic bag inside the box and if sent via USPS in this heat is almost certainly going to melt.",RUINED SHIPMENT,1

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

"Pur Luv Mini Bones for small dogs, peanut butter flavor, 2-pound bag from PetsMart. Looks like batch info is 2761SKC101 BEST BY SEP 2014.<br /><br />Just bought these in the middle of Feb 2012, and started by giving my two dogs one each in the evening.

I have tried many water flavorings and additives. So far none are worth it. This one actually smells really good. Like a srong cup of cherry koolaid. So I was hoping for the flavor as well. No such luck. One squeeze to 8oz just tasted like it poisoned my water. 2 squeezes darkened the color and made the aftertaste worse. 3 squeezes gave a light fruity hint of  flavor but the bitterness and aftertaste overwhelmed it. Since it tastes like cough syrup I did not try 4 squeezes. I might mention the aftertaste is like diet dinks with artificial sugar that makes the roof of your mouth feel caked up. So I did drink tons of good old fashioned plain water to get rid of it. So it really does make you drink more water but not for the reasons it claims.,Nasty Bitter Medicine Flavor.,1

"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

I used to buy a bag of these like every couple of months for my two mini poodles... I loved these because they make their breath smell better and good for oral health. But on one  particular occasion I gave them each one and all of a sudden Mischa(my 2 year old poodle about 7/8 pounds)  starts jumping around hysterically and at first I didn't really pay attention to her I thought she was just excited but after a few seconds I knew something was wrong. She had one of these denta stix lodged in the roof of her mouth between the opposite sides of her teeth.. So I had to dig it out of her mouth... It was a very scary experience... Her mouth was bleeding a little from it being stuck in there. I don't know if I purchased a pack that was expired or if it had gotten stale... I have no idea but that was warning enough and I knew from then on I would not be purchasing any of those denta sticks again. Before this incident I loved denta stix but I was always uneasy about how hard they are but I know they are supposed to be like that in order to keep their teeth clean... But.. It scared the crap out of me and my little Mischa. It is weird because Pineapple ( my male mini poodle who is about 8 pounds and 3 yrs) has never had that happen to him when he has dentastix... But I just wanted to let you all know.. Just in case.. Better to be safe than sorry.,These almost killed my miniature poodle,1

"This is the kind of garbage ""food"" that gives paleo/primal a bad name.<br /><br />Whenever you see the words ""Gluten-Free"" on a product label, you should immediately be skeptical.  99% of the time you'll want to run away SCREAMING at the top of your lungs.  'Cause it's not only about gluten, it's about blood sugar spikes.  If you care about your pancreas (which you can't live without), and not becoming (or staying) diabetic, you should care about this.<br /><br />Look at the ingredient list:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Manioc (Tapioca) Flour, Modified Manioc Starch (100% Manioc), Iodine-free Sea Salt, Basil, Garlic, Onion, Oregano. Manufactured In A Gluten-free Environment. Allergen Information: Contains No Wheat, No Soy, No Corn, No Rice, No Potato, No Yeast, No Nuts, No Peanuts, No Lactose, No Casein.<br /><br />Those first two ingredients are garbage carbs you don't want to eat no matter what.  Tapioca starch will spike your insulin faster than a Snickers bar... faster, even, than two slices of whole wheat bread.  No need to investigate further.<br /><br />But say you're still curious. Let's go to the Chebe website.  Here's where the real tale is told:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The box contains 10 servings, at 18 grams each - HOWEVER, you use THE ENTIRE BOX to make one pizza crust!  That's 180 grams of pure, processed carbs with zero nutritional value in one 14"" pizza crust, which is only a medium size pie.  The other ingredients you add to the crust mix are negligible carb-wise (but you still look at them): 2 eggs=1 gram, 1 cup shredded cheese=0 grams if you grate it yourself from hard, aged cheese (the pre-grated store cheeses are coated with potato starch and do add some carbs), 1/4 whole milk=2.5 grams, oil=0 grams. So 3-ish grams are added to the pie.  And now let's say you top it with tomato sauce, part-skim mozzarella and some veggies (since a pizza isn't just a crust).  Even without calculating precisely how much you're using, it's a good bet that you are adding another 30 or so carb grams.  Thus, your medium pizza pie will have 180+3+30 grams of carbs, or 213 total.  You eat half the pie, that's 106+ grams of carbs.  If you're trying to lose weight, that's more than two DAYS worth of carbs.  If you're trying to keep your blood sugar stable, you just blew that, too.<br /><br />To lose weight eating grain-free, the rule of thumb is no more than about 50 carb grams per day, no more than about 15 net carbs (carbohydrate-fiber=net carb grams) per sitting.<br /><br />And that's how you evaluate a ""Gluten-Free"" label.  Or, you could buy the product, make it, test your fasting sugar with a glucometer right before eating, then again an hour later to see firsthand what it's doing to you.  The average healthy, non-diabetic person will zoom from about 90 to 160 within an hour; then it will take another several hours after that to get back down to around 100.  Do that once a day (or several times per day) for a few years, and your problems will be over - because then you can start injecting insulin into your belly with a syringe before each meal and eat whatever you want!  And once again, the ""food"" industry and Big Pharma win.  To me, that's just sad, and the antithesis of paleo/primal eating.<br /><br />I love pizza.  I eat it all the time.  AND I eat a low-carb/high-fat diet.  In a few months, my triglycerides went from 261 to 87, and I'm no longer pre-diabetic.  That never would've happened if I were preparing meals using commercial mixes like this.  There are dozens of reputable low-carb, grain-free recipe blogs and websites out there with pizza crusts made from cheese, eggs, flax meal, nut flours, cauliflower, or even just sausage (Meatz Pizza) that are just as easy to make as this one from a processed mix, that hew to the spirit of paleo/primal eating and are far healthier to boot.",Care about your health?

"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use.

Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??).

I had to take all the product outside in a laundry basket and hose it all off, after having ""stomp dance"" on all the little buggers that had escaped into the house.  After cleaning it off, I had to pick through every one of the containers to make sure they were sealed and had no ants within.

It was a ""no-think"" to ship a product that had insect attractant (the product itself) dripped into it in storage.  At the minimum they should have sealed the box all the way around before shipping, which had not been done.  I'm not sure any packaging other then some foil sealed container would have helped keep ants out, they should have discarded the soiled product and only shipped clean packages.<br />If I ever order this stuff online again, I'm likely to be divorced.

"These are delicious soups (healthy, though typically high in sodium, but be aware that the great price on these (as compared to buying the supermarket) is largely due to the size -- these are HALF THE SIZE (16 ounces) of the typical Imagine soup product one sees in stores (presumably 32 ounces).

I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.,Never again,1
"I used my Beaba for the first time this week to make my 6 month old's food. There were some annoyance issues with its functionality (no beeping or alert to let you know when steaming is finished, smaller capacity which meant that one large sweet potato needed to be split into two steaming batches, and the fact that you have to hold the dial continuously during the puree stage or it turns off).<br /><br />While I could probably live with those factors, I became concerned when I read reviews from other parents regarding mold and other materials in the reservoir. I got out a flashlight and decided to look at the reservoir. Although I had followed the instructions to run the machine through three steam cycles before you begin using it, the reservoir contained brown liquid spots in the bottom. I used a paper towel to try and get out the spots.

That is the flavor that overpowers many of these teas, as well as cinnamon and anise, in some. People who like fruit cake might like it. I'm not one of them. I don't remember specifics about this flavor except that the picture is false advertising. The luscious orange flavor was only hinted at.

I'm guessing that the honey is supposed to cut the flavor of the peanuts, but it is hardly detectable.<br /><br />People will of course disagree with my thoughts on peanuts in the morning, but let's take a look at the side of the box.<br /><br />To keep the calories per serving at 100 (without milk), Kellogg's has shrunk the serving size to 3/4 of a cup. That means with milk, a bowl of Crunchy Nut is going to be 300 calories or slightly more. So if you go back for a second bowl, that's a pretty high caloric breakfast.

I had given my Standard Poodle 2 of them about two months ago and afterwards she couldn't poop for 3 days, a problem she never had.  I thought it MUST have been something else she ate but was concerned so I put the treats away.  Three days ago, I thought I was being neurotic and decided to give her 1 treat and see if there were any problems.

I drove her to the vet when it opened.  Her anal sac had ruptured.  She needed general anesthetic, surgery, and 14 days of antibiotics.  I told the vet my theory about the treats; she said that two weeks ago, another dog was brought in after eating the exact same treats.  She said that dog died of renal failure.  The vet also said that she had bought the same treats for her dog, and her dog was sick afterwards, so she threw them away.  I wrote an incident report to Costco and hopefully an investigation will follow.  These treats are potentially deadly.  For my dog, it made her very very sick.  The vet bill was $450.

This stuff was so sharp it actually cut my latex glove! BE CAREFUL. If it could cut my glove, it can damage a dog's stomach, colon, intestines and/or esophogus. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND NOT SOLD! There is a disclaimer on the product packaging, ""This is a natural product and may be prone to splintering."" Are you kidding me!? I have been monitoring my dog, whom regurgitated two more times since. Still not sure if I need to go to the vet yet. Gave her 1/3 can of pumpkin to coat her stomach and 3-slices of white bread, which I read will gum up and help her pass any shards in her stomach. Why any company would sell such a product is beyond me. This american made item, lacks the quality to sell in america. I am appalled it is even being sold on the shelves. STAY AWAY. Read the other negative reviews. $3500 for stomach surgery and chances of fatalities. Is it worth it to risk the life of a loved family member over a $3.00 bone! Absolutely not.

"I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

"I had to give this cat litter 1 star because of the HORRIBLE OVERPOWERING ammonia smell!  OMG!  I can barely clean it without wearing a face mask.

"I, too, first tasted this at a ""caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris"" it was about 90 degrees and reminded me of water from a hose washing over an old orange in the middle of the Sahara on a rather off day. In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation.<br /><br />My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.<br /><br />Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.<br /><br />But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make.

So, your baby is eating his/her food with mold in it. The company says they don't have this problem- probably because they are ignorant and don't care about me sending it back to test it, and people don't know because it is hard to see into the reservoir. I have only used this for about 4 months and am very clean. The manager hung up on me! They refused to listen to what I had to say, and stand by their 30-day return policy! Mold does not grow in 30 days! They must know their product is garbage with that kind of return policy. I can't believe they are allowed to sell products under that name that can cause babies and children to get sick! It's no wonder my baby had a temporary ""unknown"" allergy!

"I buy this tea often (it is very good) and am aware of three quantities it is sold in: 120 gm (0.25 lb), 227 gm (0.5 lb), 454 gram (1 lb). The description of this item says 1.5 lbs which I have never seen before, so thought it was a typo and was probably 0.5 lb. This was substantiated by another reviewer's experience where they received 0.5 lb instead of 1.5 lbs.  The price for 0.5 lb was a good, not great, but I still opted to buy a quantity of two 0.5 lb tins instead of one 1.0 lb tin from another Amazon vendor. My rational? The price was nearly the same $8.50 for each 0.5 lb tin from this vendor or 17.50 for one 1 lb tin from another vendor. I thought having two tins would preserve the freshness of my 1 lb total Jasmine Tea for a longer time. How surprised was I when this item arrived in the even smaller quantity of 120 grams (1/4 lb).

"I purchased this food upon recommendation from my vet. They told me that they had previously used the Holistic brand but it had merged with this company & they did not have experience with Eagle Pack but that they thought it was the same. I slowly added the food to my puppy's old food over the next week and she seemed to like it just fine. Well, she started having a lot of loose stools, many of which were completely liquid and even bloody for the next couple of weeks. I decided to try another food and everything completely resolved. I have since tried a couple of puppy foods equal in quality/price/reputation with no problems. Her stools are completely better, now soft but formed (like they should be!) with no sign of blood whatsoever. She has not had any gastrointestinal problems on numerous different kinds of treats either. She has been fine on 3 puppy foods, a dozen different kinds of treats...you do the math.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what the problem may have been from the ingredient list and my concern is the ""triple animal proteins"" combining chicken, pork and fish meals. This is just an invitation for food intolerance because there are more potential allergens. I think the pork is the problem. I know she tolerates chicken & chicken meal fine, not sure about fish but I've seen that frequently in other foods while I have yet to find another quality food that contains pork meal. Pig does not seem akin to a domestic dog's ""natural"" diet anyway. If they got rid of the pork, I might consider trying it again but until then I'd recommend you try another food for your puppy. I think (hope) they are generally a good company and I do see that some people's dogs have been fine on this brand, but I'm not sure this is the safest food for baby animals. I will NOT be purchasing this again & I will be contacting my vet recommending that they no longer carry it in their store. There are so many better, safer options out there.

I don't know if it's true but I've read that B12 is most effective by injection or sub-lingual.(dissolving the little pills under your tongue).<br /><br />In my opinion you'd be better advised to buy a trusted brand of mufti-vitamins and a bag of caramels if that's what you crave.

"After enjoying Passion Iced Tea at Starbucks brick and mortar stores, I was excited to make some at home with the filter bags. I would have never ordered it if I knew that it would cost me not only $27 but hours of dealing with customer service with no resolution, no filter bags, and no refund.<br /><br />In short:<br />At the end of the day, only purchase from companies you can trust. Starbucks is no longer in my list of go to trust-worthy companies. I now purchase Mighty Leaf Teas instead.<br /><br />The full story:<br />I purchased two starbucks products the Passion Iced Tea Filter bags (PITFB)and Earl Grey Tea Bags. I received the Tea Bags but not the Passion Iced Tea. I inquired with Starbucks to follow-up on the missing merchandise. Starbucks advised that the PITFB were mailed out in a separate box from the Earl Grey bags but in the same shipment. I advised that I only received one box with the shipment. At first Starbucks emailed me that the  me that I would receive a subsequent shipment.<br /><br />""Thank you for contacting Starbucks Online Ordering.<br />We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with your order.<br />After further research, all of the items shipped out but separately.<br />Please allow 5 to 10 business days to receive the remaining part of your<br />order.""<br /><br />When no new order ID generated after 10 days, I called Starbucks and was told that they would not send out a new shipment. Starbucks advised that they checked their inventory and because their ""counts matched"", a replacement would not be sent and they could determine that the passion iced tea had been mailed.<br /><br />I asked for the tracking number that was associated with the PITFB so I could investigate further. Starbucks stated that they sent two separate boxes but with one tracking number. Starbucks insisted that I file a claim with the carrier. I spoke with the carrier who stated that each box should have a tracking number. The one tracking number that was given with the order was delivered (the earl grey tea bags)so UPS could not honor a claim on the second box because there was no second tracking number on the missing merchandise. Starbucks response was that because UPS would not honor their claim (because Starbucks didn't only used one tracking # for 2 boxes) that I was out of luck and nothing further could be done.<br /><br />Starbucks, a company that I have traditionally enjoyed doing business with, has discouraged me from purchasing their products again...on Amazon or otherwise. The customer service agent and his supervisor's inability to address the shipping department's error and take no responsibility for seeing the transaction through is incredibly disappointing. I expected more from a company that is praised for its customer-centric attitude when in reality Starbucks neither offered to replace the unreceived merchandise nor refund the cost of the PITFB.<br /><br />I have attempted to obtain a refund through Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee Program on June 16. As of 09-02-11 and several inquiries to Amazon, I still have not received a credit to my Amazon account nor a refund to my credit card.<br /><br />This has been my worst Amazon experience to date.",Never Received Product- Starbucks Poor Customer Service!,1

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",Kitty Junk Food,1

I've read a lot about growing these chilis and I am doing everything perfectly including keeping the seeds/soil warm. I live in Arizona so warm temperatures aren't a problem. After a month of trying to grow the plant I contacted the magic plant company. They sent me more seeds which looked like the flakes you put on pizza minus the seeds. I planted them anyway.

"I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong.

"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"".

Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5.

There is no geographic pattern to the illnesses and deaths - cases have been reported from all 50 states and 6 Canadian provinces.<br /><br />The FDA says the majority of complaints involve chicken jerky (treats, tenders, and strips), but others include duck, sweet potato, and treats where chicken or duck jerky is wrapped around dried fruits, sweet potatoes, or yams.<br /><br />The report goes on to say that in the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in importation of pet food from China. It is estimated that nearly 86 million pounds of pet food came from China in 2011. Pet treats, including jerky pet treats, are currently considered the fastest growing segment in the pet food market.<br /><br />The FDA has been investigating the reports of illnesses, but no definitive cause has been determined.<br /><br />""The ongoing global investigation is complex, multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the FDA including toxicologists, epidemiologists, veterinary researchers, forensic chemists, microbiologists, field investigators and senior agency officials,"" the report says.<br /><br />The FDA says product samples have been tested for contaminants known to cause the symptoms and illnesses reported in pets, and they are now expanding testing to include irradiation byproducts and they are consulting with NASA experts about it.<br /><br />In their report, the FDA says jerky treats are not necessary for pets to have a balanced diet - basically advising people not to feed them to their pets. But if you choose to give your pet the treats,  watch them closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination.",FDA says pet death toll from jerky treats now at 360,1

"Like many other reviewers, I've been eating this for YEARS and am in total shock that Kellogg made such a drastic change for the worst. This is a completely different cereal now, and one that I wouldn't buy. It's definitely not worth the price anymore.

Except those taste better than this does.<br /><br />The product I received is NOT what I paid for; after weeks of trying to like it, I'm ready to request a refund. Yes, it's that bad now. If you used to like this cereal, don't buy a 4 pack until you've tried it.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed. It WAS the only high-protein, somewhat lower carb cereal that didn't taste (or cost) like diet food. I'd eat a bowl and not feel hungry before lunch. It was slightly sweet, even my kids liked it!

The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.<br /><br />I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased.

"When I opened my first box of Strawberry Delight Frosted Mini Wheats this morning, I thought I had bought something other than cereal by mistake.  I was expecting something like the usual Frosted mini wheats, with the exception of some pink frosting and perhaps some strawberry flavor.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />Instead, I got a little square of frosting, colored by a pink not found on this Earth and ""scented"" the with the strongest chemical candy perfume that I have ever had the misfortune to come across. It hovered over the box like a pink cloud before taking out a mallet and knocking me into a diabetic coma. There were a few twigs of what was supposed to be cereal, but it was abundantly clear that the frosting is the reason for this stuff, and the twigs are merely a crumb being thrown to caring parents, so they will serve this stuff instead of a nutritious meal. Indeed the only nutritional claim on the box is wrong: the box says that one serving contains 25% of a day's allowance of fiber, when the nutritional information clearly says a serving of this stuff  has only 20% of a day's allowance of fiber. Which one is it?<br /><br />I don't think that the fiber question will matter to the other reviewers,  with most of them eating the confection out of hand as a snack.  Sadly that means they are getting a whole heck of a lot more than the suggested serving of 24 tiny squares of frosting. Happily, that means they'll likely get a whole day's supply of fiber, but they'll also end up with a week's supply of sugar.<br /><br />Once in a while, I have order food from Amazon that does not suit my taste.  This cereal is one of those items.  Usually, I donate the unopened packages to the local food pantry and count it as some good coming from my lesson.

It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content.

"This is a nice idea, but you can only fit half a sweet potato in it at a time. You should instead buy yourself an immersion blender, which is super easy to clean and useful for other things too. Steaming your food in a regular pot with a steamer basket is much faster and easier, and you don't need to be plugged in to do it. The Babycook is so cute and the idea is so nice, I just had to buy it.<br /><br />I have some issues with the design as well as the function - the lid is awkward to close, a little lip on the lid has to slide into a little crevice on the body before you can use it. Very annoying to use, and you cannot get the thing off when you are done unless you use two hands. The food chopping function only happens when you have the switch turned, so its never hands free except when you are steaming, which takes longer than steaming on my gas stove. The cord is also too short, which is never good in the kitchen.<br /><br />I did a test last night, half of the sweet potato in the babycook and half on the stove (chopped). Stove won, it was done first. But wait, the babycook will puree too right, so that was handy.  But in order to puree a potato you need additional water, and that means a two handed removal of the lid and then the same thing to get it back on again. If there are chunks, its off again with the lid - very annoying.  You can't fit much in the babycook to puree even after taking out the steaming basket. You are still limited to one half of a sweet potato, so I had to puree in batches.<br /><br />An immersion blender is nice because you can move it around to get all the chunks, you can tilt the container etc.. I got this as a gift, I asked for it actually. But now I would love to return it.<br /><br />Save your money and invest in an immersion blender for when you are making larger batches and a hand held food mill that doesn't need to be plugged in when baby eats what the family is eating but in a softer form.<br /><br />Definitely not recommended.",not worth the money,1

"If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.",Not good.,1

"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way.

It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils.

"The only good comment I can give on these treats is that my cat liked them when they were fresh, and they are really inexpensive! I can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the grocery or pet store, and even on occasion at the dollar store. As this treat proves, often with a low price, comes a cheap product.  It would be nice if these pounce treats had healthier ingredients, maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser, but no, its just junk food and a long list of filler ingredients. They smell really gross to me but my cat seemed to enjoy them. My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy texture. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth- hopefully crunching off some tarter with it. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have as many beneficial dental ingredients, but they are pretty good as well as they contain vitamins and a little bit of breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. Any crunchy treat would be better than these. Even other Pounce varieties are MUCH better than these, such as the Tarter & Plaque control varieties. The Pounce Tarter & Plaque control are a bit more pricey, but still relatively inexpensive and they contain vitamins and are crunchy. Another strange thing about these treats is that the recommended daily allotment is 6-8 treats per day, which is just crazy to me. I only give my cats no more than 1-2 a day of these while I had them. I eventually threw them out as they got hard as rocks and my cats didn't like them anymore anyhow.<br /><br />Pros: cat approved taste while fresh; and very fair price<br />Cons: bad smell, lack of nutrition, terrible texture for teeth","Not the best cat treat in my opinion, but they are cat approved at first",1

"I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.","The cat, the dog, nor the grackles would touch it",1

"I have two cats, one of which didn't get to be 23 lbs by refusing cat treats.

This doesn't exactly fit the ""stress"" problem that the product is designed for but we thought it might help calm him down a bit particularly when we have guests that aren't dog people and don't care for his enthusiasm. The dosage calls for 1-6 ml depending on weight with the max dose of 6ml for anything over 40#.  The first time we tried it we gave 5ml and saw no results.  Last night we tried again with 7ml (slightly over recommended dose).  Again there was no visible calming.  This morning the dog went with me for our usual jog and then back at the house he had some kind of seizure or tremors that lasted about 5 minutes with shaking and very limited, wobbly control of his back legs.  By late morning he was his usual self.<br /><br />So, admittedly we did not use exactly for the intended purpose and did slightly over-dose him although according to directions he could have had another dose after 6 hours and we only gave one.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

"Well, I'm now truly 'Ratch free.<br /><br />And all I have to say is, ""Wow.  I never thought it would happen to me.""  I can't believe what's all happened since I was found face-down in the grocery store aisle with a half-full bottle of Sriracha stuck up one nostril and and the other half the bottle dribbling out the other nostril.<br /><br />Worse, my mouth was stuffed full of sirloin tip samples that I - at least this is what I'm told - wrenched from the Sample Lady at the condiment end-cap.  Evidently, I saw how she dabbed her meat bites in a little plastic cup of house-brand barbeque sauce and the rest...is...my shame.<br /><br />The scene I made wasn't pretty. Suffice it to state, 22 people had Sriracha stains on their shirts and...that bottle stuck up my nose?  It was actually the third bottle I abused - the first one  used to drown the sample tray of steak tips and the second...well, I drank it like a little kid drinking Kool-aid on a hot day.<br /><br />My rage-filled rampage against the condiment companies and purveyors of flavorlessness saw no bounds.  I have a hazy memory of running stiff-armed, along an entire row of catsup bottles cascading them onto the linoleum.  The dull thuds of taught red plastic bouncing off the floor still haunts my dreams...<br /><br />Somewhere in the moments that followed, I found a frozen salmon and used it to knock out whole sections of Mexican, Italian, Chinese and fake Wasabi sauces into space - bang!  bang!  bang!  I laughed maniacally whenever the obscenely expensive jars of boutique blech cracked two, three, four aisles away.<br /><br />By then the local news had showed up - virtually none of my howl against the Jalepeno Junta was fit for broadcast.<br /><br />Anyway, I woke up at the Scandinavian Cuisine Sanitarium two days later knowing that I could never touch Sriracha Sauce again.

"I was excited to find a natural sugar substitute when I came across Xylitol.  When I got it, my kids and I made lemonade: lemon juice, water and XyloSweet.  About 45 minutes later, halfway through lunch, I noticed my 6 year old daughter stopped eating her lunch, and she didn't look too good. She told me she didn't feel good and so I put her down for a nap. Ten minutes later, my son didn't feel good either.  Long story short: my daughter got diarrhea, and luckily, because she hadn't had that much lemonade, her diarrhea wasnt too severe.  Unfortuneately for my five year old son, who had a lot more lemonade to drink, he first started throwing up, and then also started having the runs--both at the same time!  Poor kid.  About the time I almost had them both settled down, my stomach was churning, and next thing you know I had to rush to the bathroom, for the first of what would end up being nine trips.<br />In between bathroom trips, I Googled: ""Xylitol reactions"" and was surprised at the number of listings that popped up.  I found that supposedly about 20% of people that try xylitol will have a reaction.  I think that figure is on the low side because my two kids are adopted from totally different sets of parents.

"This shake was one of the last shakes I could find that was both energizing, good for me (especially the non-gluten part), and helped me gain weight. I recently had 2 surgeries, and was looking forward to using orgain to get better. Had I known they were going to completely botch the formula, I would've ordered 10 cases beforehand.<br /><br />But I order 3 cases a month ago... and they were so undrinkable i assumed we got a bad batch of spoiled ones. But there were 3 separate cases like this... with the individual drinks inside tasting 'spoiled'. The expiration date seemed okay.<br /><br />Well, now its clear that the product wasn't spoiled... the formula was spoiled.<br /><br />I'm just so, so disappointed. Orgain had become a major supplement towards my health and recovery process after an injury I sustained last year and was hoping it would continue to be so during my recovery phase after the surgery.<br /><br />That's the type of mindset this drink was created for, right? A doctor made it because he knew the need for healthy, essential amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, and organic blends to help someone gain weight, especially if they're been sick? A formula he concocted after beating cancer? Why not stick that??<br /><br />Am very disappointed to see this cheap change destroy the product that the brand was about.<br />Why should anyone prefer this over any other pre-made drink other than its hypoallergenic aspects? Many of the younger, healthier guys who're drinking this because it was simply better for you ounce for ounce than other mixes... well, good luck keeping them now. Especially with the huge change in taste. Just... augh. You can't even get it down.<br /><br />Am very sad to see such an amazing product be gutted without warning to its loyal consumers. If there really is a Doctor out there in charge of this company... well, I hope you still have a say in it, that you're reading these reviews, and hopefully that you'll evaluate your altered product for yourself and decide whether or not its something you would've preferred to the old orgain when you were recovering and rebuilding healthy mass. I imagine you would say - ""no"" - the old orgain was far more beneficial.<br /><br />I'm now looking for a new supplement shake.

Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries.

I ended up with a gooey mass of something that I plopped into a pan and baked so as not to waste it!  I had to start all over again and made a cereal crust instead.  Double the trouble, double the mess!  THAT's what I get for being lazy!  Anyway, the point is, this flour is great for breads, biscuits, rolls, and so forth, but NOT for anything sweet!  Don't use it for your cakes, cookies, pie crusts, etc.  You won't get the flavor you expect!  Perhaps it should be renamed, ""Some Purpose Flour!""  Happy baking!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Originally, I emphasized that this flour is not for all purposes.  Well, now it seems it is for no purpose at all because it is full of bugs!  I keep my flour in Lock 'n Lock containers and none of my other flours have suffered the same fate (in the same cupboard).  This leads me to believe that the little buggers were already in the flour when I got it...  I'll be looking for another flour mix now!",BUGGED,1
"It's not just THIS Walden Farms product, but every one I've tried. Syrups, marshmallow dip, Ketchup, Cocktail sauce.....!!

"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.

So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply.

"Okay, so the box sat on my counter for 2 months while I tried to find the time to make this product-- since it's not a quick thing to make pastries from scratch. I was going to feature this product on my blog--where I often give tips on healthy desserts, pet help & relationships. It's the holidays and I finally decided to make the time.  I got out my camera to chronicle this event and gave this my best efforts. Unfortunately, I just wasted 3 hours and lots of efforts on what turned out to be CARDBOARD.<br /><br />First, the company is in Australia, I believe, and assumes that we already know what to do. The directions were minimal and it didn't even give baking instructions--once the pastry was prepared.  It was very difficult and time consuming and the end result was YUCK.  There were many naughty words heard from the direction of the kitchen--and more accurately, my lips.  My husband and handyman were laughing-- right along with me--as I forced them to try them out.  Big thumbs down.<br /><br />* I'm sure a PASTRY CHEF or someone who does this all of the time--might have tips--but for the above average--gluten free baker--I would say, SKIP IT and find something else.

"My dog is an older dog, and I bought these treats for her in order to perhaps help her with her stiff joints. Within a few days of giving her these treats, my dog started having seizures. At first we weren't sure what might be causing them because she had never had a seizure before. The seizures increased, and we took her to the vet. The vet couldn't find anything wrong with her that might be causing the seizures. About two months after beginning the treats, I determined that this was the only variable as the seizures had started soon after. We stopped giving them to her as soon as we made the connection and the seizures stopped right away and she hasn't had one since. I don't know why these treats affected her this way, but I would strongly suggest that people stay away from these treats. Seeing your beloved pet go through something like this is very upsetting, but it is even more upsetting knowing that it happened because of something I gave her.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

I thought he had calmed down so we went for a drive, he had a mood swing because I disagreed with him about something, he called himself stupid and started literally PUNCHING his own face while driving!!! He broke his glasses and started crying and gasping for air saying his heart was beating out of his chest. He then proceeded to do 108 MPH with our two young children in the back weaving on and off the road. He made an abrubt stop and got out. At that point I was scared to death and praying he would walk in front of a car. I started to dial 911 on my phone. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance as police feared he was having a stroke. They said drinking the 5 hour energy on a half empty stomach triggered a response when his saritonin levels started to fluctuate drastically causing possible suicidal/homicidal thoughts and frequent mood swings~ I was 25 years old at the time, my two children were 1 and 4 years old.

"As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.<br /><br />I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.<br /><br />""Stacey""'s review sold me on it:<br /><br />""Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with ""meat by-product"" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be ""unfit for human consumption"". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered ""waste"" and packaging it up as ""healthy & nutritious"" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not ""sold-out"" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of ""aflatoxin poisoning"" from the ""healthy & nutritious"" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as ""Natural"", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their ""high priced waste"" and heavily marketing it as ""natural"".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. """,Not what I thought,1
"I had ordered 2 bottles of the hot sauce and also paid 1-3 day shipping on it.  I actually paid more for the shipping than I did for the 2 bottles of sauce.  I did not receive my packagae until 9 days later but I was shorted a bottle.  I wrote to the company and told them of this.  They agreed to sending me another bottle free of shipping.  Mind you, this is a $5 bottle of sauce.  Three days later I receive an email stating that they reviewed their camera recording and it was clear that there was 2 bottles shipped together and that the weight of the package was correct for the amount shipped.  So they insinuated I had lied to them.  I am not sure what happened on their end, but there was only 1 bottle of sauce in my package.  Not sure why someone would lie over a $5 bottle of sauce so they could get it for free.  It is a shame because granted, the sauce is hot but good, and they would have received several orders from some from friends, but knowing what the company has accused me of can guarantee no other orders will be placed.  Word of mouth is a company's advertisement, and it is unfortunate this company will not be getting any positive feedback from me.  I have never been accused of lieing and take great insult over it that this company would do so.  You can be assured I will be ordering from some other company in hopes that the shipping rate is equal to the time paid for, and where the company sends the correct amount ordered.  Makes me wonder why the company is so upset to lose the $5 bottle that is owed to me due to their mistake, possibly because they have treated other customers with the same respect which is none!!",Horrible service,1
"I have a 1 year old lab/Shepard mix and she is a very active chewer.  I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn't able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with brushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.<br /><br />My dog - 70 pounds, 1 year old lab/Shepard mix.  She eats the beef Orijen food blended with California natural.<br /><br />Edit -<br /><br />My dog Taro is now three and a half and I see these chews at the Vet clinic I go to.  I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people's dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of ""is this useful votes"" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.  I hope this isn't the case because they would be toying with the danger of killing our dogs.",Be careful.  May be good for teeth but present a choking hazard.,1

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1
"I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.",Worst Junk Food Ever,1

"I purchased this thinking I would get an assortment of several K-cups to try.

"I ordered this sampler along with the ""Extra Bold"" sampler, which I've already reviewed.<br /><br />This sampler was more disappointing than the other. Very different mix from that advertised. Among my 35 K-cups are 3 that are for ICED coffee - they say ""Brew Over Ice."" Well, most of us don't have the Keurig that does that. Nothing to do with these but toss them into the trash.<br /><br />Also included without advertisement were 4 that are decaf. That is a major foul, Amazon! Into the trash with those too. So one fifth of these - 7 out of 35 - are completely useless to me.<br /><br />There were 5 teas as opposed to the 3 advertised. Fortunately, I do like a variety of teas.<br /><br />Among the other coffee K-cups, most were included on the list on the product page, but some were not. Not a big deal. A sampler is a sampler.<br /><br />But I think Amazon should state the apparent truth on these pages: These ""Crazy Cups"" samplers are probably a way for Amazon to recoup losses when someone returns an opened package of K-cups, or they have boxes that are damaged, or whatever. They just count them out and toss them into a carton at random, and ship it. It's not a genuine retail product.<br /><br />Not bad if you haven't tried a lot of different K-cup varieties and just want a bunch of different ones to check out, but don't expect an exact match to what's listed on the product page. I will say, this assortment had zero duplications, whereas the ""Extra Bold"" sampler (MUCH of which was not extra bold) had 3 of one variety, and many duplications. However, if I ordered the same samplers again, I wouldn't expect them to match up much at all with the previous purchases. I really think this is just Amazon's ways of getting rid of hurts and returns, and you get what you get.<br /><br />By the way, ""frustration-free"" packaging just means Amazon is being cheap. Throw stuff into a box loose and stick a piece of tape on it. It was NOT frustration-free, because it had a shipping label that has the packing slip stuck to the back of it. It had ""tear here first"" tear strips that do not come off, so no access to the packing slip without tearing it up.<br /><br />I'm editing this to add that I have just noticed that another reviewer said that as of 12/31/11, Amazon was sending these in nice giftable boxes. NOT anymore as of 1/6/12. Just a plain shipping carton, with loose K-cups. DO NOT expect something you can present as a gift without some creative repackaging of your own, and if you don't mind giving some K-cups that look pretty beat up.","Come on, Amazon, these ""samplers"" are a rip-off",2

"I have tried a large variety of these drinks and taste-wise this one ranks up there with being good, but the ingredients and after effects just bring it way down.<br /><br />I tried this one frozen (slightly thawed) and it actually mushed well. The after taste was not bad and in this form the syrup did not get that bad feel in your mouth like some of these do. But the ingredient list is outrageous with so many bad things and the highest volume of sugar I have seen in one of these drinks (over 65g). The syrup is high fructose corn, and the preservatives and colors just make it worse.<br /><br />I know this drink is sought after as referenced in so many reviews here, but the sugar content and syrup definitely left a bad feeling in my stomach...will not be drinking it again.

"I have been roasting green coffee beans at home for nearly a decade. Costa Rica Tarrazu is my favorite bean. I did not find this brand of this variety of coffee to be as flavorful as beans from my usual supplier. It roasts well.

"I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts, and have found Celsius brand to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.  Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.<br /><br />Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!<br /><br />Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.<br /><br />I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM"">Celsius®, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG"">Celsius®, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product.","Celsius ""YES"", but Orange Flavor is a ""NO"" for me",2

The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.

I used to buy it from Amazon and Amazon itself used to carry the 2 20-ounce bags for under half of what it is now selling for. The closest thing I have found is a Starbucks roasted sold from Costco in their own brand. That is a solidly good coffee and great price if you can buy it in the store.

"I wish I had know that this product was changed in a very significant way. We were buying the freeze dried liver for training treats. It was real liver, diced into small pieces that were easy to transport and carry. The product now, with the misleading description of ""ceter cut"", is processed liver that has been stamped out. It is soft and extremely crumbly, and is reduced to powder in my pockets in no time. Comparison of the empty container with this new one showed no difference at all except for an adhesive label placed on the cover over the old one. I called the company to ask about the product change; the rep explained they changed the product to the processed one and said customer feedback indicates people don't like it. She said the regular, natural liver is still made, and is available at a national chain pet store, but not on Amazon. She kept apologizing, and was unable to explain to me why a correct description is not on the container; at this price, I would have appreciated a coupon toward the regular product at the pet store, since I have a 3/4 tub of the crumbly stuff that I can't use. I wish Amazon would carry the ""old"" product also, with an accurate description.

The idea behind buying this is to have a natural pick-me-up in the morning.  The problem is they have doses of things in it that are too high.  Back when the natural supplement/remedies law changed allowing manufacturers to sell so call natural products it created a problem and this type of product is one of the symptoms of that problem.

However, we both noticed the first and sucessive times we used them that they curdled in the coffee. We shook them, but they still curdled.

"I tried the Rocky Road flavor and while it is not awful, it is nothing to rave over.  When something is described as a ""sinfully healthy snack"", I expect it to taste magical and leave me in awe that it only has 140 calories.  These small bars are not decadent or sinfully healthy.  They taste like unsweetened no-bake cookies to an extent and have a slight vitamin aftertaste that frequently accompanies protein and nutrition bars.  Inside the bar, I found a couple of nuts but everything else melded together and if it were a blind taste test, I would never guess them to be rocky road inspired.  Nutritionally, I don't think this bar is great.  For a small 140 calorie bar, it has a good deal of fat (8g) and sugar (9g).<br /><br />If you insist on trying these and they are out of stock here, you can get your halo bar fix on iherb.com.

I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous brand.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi-gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it.","Great food, but with the October 2012 price increase, not sure it's a good value.",2

"My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Kiwi Berry was the least desirable of the two.  It tasted like it had way too much sugar, even though the can claims to have no sugar added.  The strawberry flavor was predominant, overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely.  In all, it tasted like strawberry candy.  Even worse -- it had a kind of chemical-y bitterness to it.  If you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy, go ahead and try Switch.  But if not -- avoid this.  I would especially not want to buy this flavor.  There are better ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix.",Sweetness Overload,2

"When Starbucks came out with the ""blonde"" roasts, I got pretty excited because I prefer lighter roasts (as do 40% of coffee drinkers, according to the barista at the store)... light roasts are a little earthier, not as burnt tasting.  So I scored a bag each of the Willow and Veranda.<br /><br />This one, the Veranda, didn't do a lot for us.  Subjectively speaking, it was so smooth it was boring... it had no snap, and was kind of mixed and mushy, not a definitive flavor.  It's supposed to have ""delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts"" - really?  We missed that.<br /><br />On the other hand, we really liked the Willow, which had a brighter citrus-y note and was more flavorful.  The taste was (for lack of better words) clear, defined.  You buy a light roast to taste the bean, not the roast.  The Willow was flavorful, not acidy, and had a clean finish.<br /><br />Your tastes may vary, but if you like a snappy light roast, or a ""breakfast roast"" the Veranda probably won't be your pick, but do try the Willow.","meh... not a fave, prefer the other blonde",2

I had taken the chance on the Hazlenut Truffles because the Gems had gone over well.<br /><br />I'm giving the Hazlenut Truffles two stars, because I love the idea of several small boxes of chocolates in a bundle, where you can order nice candy and give a box to as many as three people for a reasonable price.

"Because the point of using honey for me is to avoid the fast changes in blood glucose levels that come with refined/processed sugars -- this ""not-all-honey"" honey product does not work.  If you go to the company's website, it clearly says that this is only 60% honey -- the rest is maltodextrin, a fructose usually derived from wheat.  That's like paying for steak that is 40% breadcrumbs.<br /><br />Yes, you are getting pure honey in this -- but you're also getting filler.  Honey does not need a preservative or flavor enhancer, and it certainly doesn't need added fructose.  If it is impossible to make a powdered or granulated product from honey, companies should just say so, and not market something as honey when it's really just 3/5 honey.  A company that starts out its relationship to me by trying to deceive me, is off my list -- no matter what else they make.",Not exactly what the name implies...,2

"nice light tasting green tea.  Enjoyed it as part of a variety pack bought at my grocery store so ordered the same tea in bulk here.  However, the packaging of tea shipped by Amazon is inadequate and makes this tea nearly unusuable.  Each tea bag opens at the top when the tag/label string is pulled apart from the bag just before using the tea bag. The adhesive holding the top of the tea bags together is not strong enough to withstand even tiny, gentle pull from trying to ""unstick"" the tag and string from the bag.  Other than that the packaging is normal Lipton packaging (white paper outer envelope for each bag, thin cardboard box.  But this one defect is enough to make the tea unusuable (unless you like sifting it through your teeth as you drink) without resorting to self help such as personally stapling each tea bag closed after loosing the tag.  While the tea itself is ok and a nice light green tea for those who don't like the really strong kind, this is too much annoyance, I tossed these and will not reorder this brand of tea online, especially in bulk.  I am a lifelong tea drinker and have not experienced this problem with any other teas with anywhere near such frequency as I have with each box in this 6-pack of boxes of Lipton Green Tea.  The similar tea I purchased in a store had no problems.","Nice tea, poorly packaged- tea bags open at the top and let leaves out",2
"I picked up a package of Via out of curiosity. For the record, I am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won ""Coffee Bar of the Year"" for the past 4 years in CT. We roast coffee for other cafes as well so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like. Here's my impression of Via:<br /><br />It is certainly easy to prepare. I generally drink a 16oz coffee so I used 2 packets (they are sized for an 8oz serving) to prepare my cup. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black and what I taste is only the coffee (my preference for brewing water is a neutral pH of 7, a Langelier Index of zero and no chlorine, fluoride, or lime).<br /><br />On to the coffee:  A good Colombian should be very balanced, with good body, brightness* and a nutty flavor. Truth be told, most Colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring, and most are at best a simply decent, clean cup with almost no aftertaste. Unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh** from a roaster which is unlikely.<br />The Via Colombian that I tried might have started out as an Arabica coffee from the low end of the Specialty Coffee spectrum. Since I don't know the timeline for production, it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a ""woody"" note that I associate with aged beans. The actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately Via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste. After a few seconds, there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent. I typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known ""donut"" shop coffee (which I am mystified why anyone would drink...just terrible). As for the flavored versions of Via, I am really not a fan of ANY flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee. I drink coffee because I like the flavor. This was my second tasting of Via. I tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar. I really think that a high end instant is a good idea, but unfortunately for me, Via misses the mark.<br /><br />For a quick and relatively convenient cup, I would suggest investing $30 in an ""AeroPress"" made by Aerobie and widely available. Armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster, you get a tasty, easy to prepare cup, and a very simple cleanup..<br /><br />* We use the descriptive term ""acidity"" to describe brightness. This is not to be confused with the often heard term ""acidic"" which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs. This is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, molds, fungus, and other contaminants often found in non-specialty grade coffee. We believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee.<br />** Fresh = less than two weeks from roasting. Most coffee is WAY beyond this timeline....",I like the concept of an instant coffee....,2
"After looking at a site that referenced 5-hour energy and finding out that NALT (N-Acetyl, L-Tyrosine) was an ingredient, I went to wikipedia to find out the other ingredients and lo and behold all five major cognitive-enhancing supplements (I'm including the B-Complex Vitamins here)including in this drink were the four that constituted my core stack for mental-intensive tasks (I substitute Alpha-GPC for CDP-Choline on occasion, due to it's effectiveness at crossing the blood-brain barrier . The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are ""Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine"".

Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go.

"This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.

"I'm not sure when Cytomax changed their formula, but in regards to taste it was a huge step backwards. The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars.",Not an improvement,2

"I am jumping on the bandwagon with all of those reviewers who said this coffee is weak. I am disappointed that the Marley name is on this. I used two of these pods to make two cups of coffee. Yuck! Not only did it taste terrible, but it was incredibly weak. From my standpoint, you would need to use a minimum of two of these per cup of coffee. And that would probably have to be demitasse size to have it taste worthwhile. There also was none of that wonderful coffee aroma that you get with a good coffee.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are no instructions on the box to tell you how much to use. I wasn't sure if it was my drip coffeemaker or not, but my guess is that the water would have to soak like a teabag.

Coconut flour is more expensive.<br /><br />You should know that rice is a grain and thus is a carbohydrate.  It might be gluten free, yes, so you don't get those nasty effects, but it's not a ""low carb"" food which meshes with ""Paleo"" or ""Primal"" approaches to eating.<br /><br />I'm eating the stuff slowly, as I'm not going to throw it away and waste money, but I won't be buying it again.",Guess I Need to Pay Closer Attention,2

"When my Keurig Platinum finally wore out, I reasoned that a ""commercial"" unit might be a good long-lasting replacement. I used some of my Keurig loyalty points and bought an OfficePro direct from Keurig at half price. From the start brewing was LOUD. I mean like starting a blender or bean grinder loud.We have a fairly large house and it could be heard in the upstairs closet, as far away from the brewer as you can be and still be in the house.I called Keurig, and a tech listened to the machine over the phone. She agreed it was the loudest coffee maker she'd ever heard, but after a conversation w / a supervisor told me that the machine was performing as designed. Since I was within the 30 day window, I returned the machine and replaced it with an Elite model. Keurig was good about the whole thing, even sending me coupons for enough k-cups to offset the return shipping. I suggested that they make a note in the product description about the above-average sound level, but I doubt that happened.<br />  If you're planning to use this machine in an environment that is naturally loud, it might be a fit, but in any kind of a situation where a normal level of sound is expected, the OfficePro, while producing a good cup of coffee in a timely manner, is, IMHO way too noisy.",Should probably come with ear protection,2

I own an Illy x6 and it came with a sampler of illy ese pods. When those ran out I researched online and ordered these pods. First of all the pod is not tightly packed and has a looseness which makes the fit in the holder improper. As a result sometimes the illy machine keeps on going and overflows the normal quantity which an espresso cup would hold.<br /><br />Secondly the flavor body and aroma are diffuse and not good for espresso.

Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again.

I compared the water test results provided by Essentia on their Web site and those of my local water authority.<br /><br />Essentia says, ""Electrolytes are dissolved minerals in the body that conduct electricity, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. We add trace amounts of those same elements in a formula that complements the body's naturally occurring mix and concentration."" They must be really trace amounts. Reading their water test report, neither calcium or potassium are listed, and only .68 mg/l of magnesium. The sodium level is about the same as in my tap water. Certainly not the electrolyte levels of Gatorade.<br /><br />I can find nothing in my research that indicates a pH of 9.5 is anything special.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm not impressed.

"Last month after my local pet store ran out of the Cosmic cat grass my cats had long been using to fight off hairballs,  I came here to Amazon, found two products that looked interesting and bought  one of each.  I had very disappointing luck with this one.  I  read the instructions and followed them clearly, paying particular attention to keeping the soil moist and warm and the light dim until germination. I used an 8-inch garden pot and the same Miracle Grow potting soil that had worked wonders in my outdoor garden pots.  But the results were disappointing.  All I got were a scattered few strands of grass.  A  second attempt, using more seeds and a different, smaller pot netted the same meager results.<br /><br />Meanwhile my other purchase, the Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit--which came with similar instructions, but  its own soil, disposable planter pouch and far fewer seeds at twice the price--produced a veritable thicket of grass that kept  growing and growing and, despite daily grazings from three cats,  lasted  five full weeks.<br /><br />I still have some Nibble-Licious seeds left, so would gladly appreciate comments from those of you who've had good results with  this product on what you did right that I may have done wrong and how to fix it.<br /><br />\<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006348H2"">Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit</a>","Skimpy grazing in these parts with this product, sad to say",2

"My cats generally love all toys made by Fat Cat.  I don't know if it's the catnip within or the vast array of colors, shapes, sizes and crinkly noises that attracts them.  All I know is that I'd never purchased a Fat Cat toy my cats didn't like.  Until this one, that is.<br /><br />I thought it would be perfect for interactive play, and if I had kittens, I probably would've been right.  They'll play with just about anything though.  Problem is, the glove itself is just plain awkward (very much in the style of Freddy Krueger), primarily because the fingers are twice as long as human fingers and you can't achieve much separation between them.  Oddly enough, all of my cats seemed to view having four toys simultaneously shoved in their face as an invasion of their personal space rather than an invitation to play.<br /><br />The good news is that after I removed the lures from the glove (which seemed to be well constructed and durable), they played with them on their own.  The bad news is that I paid far too much for those four tiny toys.",Annoyingly Awkward,2

"This is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc<br /><br />Yet why have I rated it 2 stars? The simple answer it has far too much vinegar and it ends up tasting like vinegar and a bit bitter too. In addition, this sauce lacks any character beyond that heavy dose of vinegar. Now, if you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you might love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are much better ones, including ones that have a fair amount of vinegar.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.<br /><br />BTW: You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!<br /><br />Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then you can save a lot of money by buying it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They don't cost much more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar or is at least - better balanced.<br /><br />Try any of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a vague hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! It has no vinegar, is considerably more potent than Franks, yet just a bit sweet. Compared to Franks you have to be careful not to add too much.<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - low to medium heat and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar but is diluted, much like Franks yet with a far superior taste. Highly recommended<br /><br />c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend and not so hot that it is unforgiving.<br /><br />d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.<br /><br />e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but still far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.<br /><br />If you happen to like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of the ABOVE. For only a few bucks for a bottle, what is there to lose?<br /><br />I hope Amazon customers will rate my review after taste testing one of these other hot sauces.<br /><br />My very best<br /><br />Thanks",Mild heat combined with far too much vinegar,2

To clarify, both the taste and the consistency have changed from before. The product is now thicker and overall tastes closer to typical protein drinks which for my personal taste is a letdown.

I love the Senseo medium roast coffee.  The decaf was said to be the same only without the caffine.  So I was so excited to receive my order this weekend.  However I was soon disapointed as it had a sort of burnt carmel flavor.

"When I first heard of Crystal Light's Mocktails line of flavors, I wasn't quite sure what to think. Are these intended as low-calorie hard drink mixers? Are you just supposed to drink the flavored waters made with these powders, and have that serve as your drink, minus the alcohol? The limited information on the back of the containers didn't help, although I suppose Crystal Light might not feel comfortable endorsing alcohol consumption...<br /><br />Either way, THIS particular flavor of Crystal Light's Mocktails line didn't help things. Granted, I haven't had many Appletinis, but comparing what this powder mixed up to the proper Appletini I tried at Carrabba's recently left me still scratching my head. This mix didn't make anything even close to what I tasted at the restaurant. The apple flavor wasn't all that ""fresh"" tasting, nor was it terribly strong or potently ""apple-y"", which I think would've improved this mix, had that been the case. It also didn't taste sweet enough, going by what my Appletini-loving friend said of the perfect Appletini. He described the perfect Appletini as tasting like a liquid jolly rancher with a kick. Alcohol or not (not, in the case of my mixture of this powder and water), this mix just, again, confused me. There wasn't enough apple taste to it, and I wasn't sure what else they were aiming for. Either way, they missed. If their Appletini doesn't even really taste like apple, should it even be called Appletini?

"This is Hershey's ""new"" version of what they called ""European Style Dutch Processed Cocoa,"" which was in a silver, white and red box.  They updated the ESDP Cocoa to European Style Dutch Processed Cocoa -- Special Dark.<br /><br />I used to buy the old version (silver box) by the case.  We LOVED it.  It made the BEST hot cocoa, mousse and icings.  It was rich, smooth and had a wonderful chocolate flavor.

"Without a car of our own the small size and light weight of the Incline Scratcher seemed like definite features (as did the price!), so we happily took one home. Our pair of boisterous Bengals enjoyed poking at the paper pom-pom inside, and were intrigued by the scratching surface.

That was enough for SisterCat - she wasn't interested in going near it again, no matter how much we coaxed or cajoled.<br /><br />We tried weighing it down firmly, and BrotherCat gave it another go... at which point his claws caught in the cardboard and he ended up pulling the entire scratching-pad out from the main structure.

I bought Artemis and after going through three large bags of this formula, her digestive issues have only gotten worse. She has very loose stools and passes the most awful gas.

In fact, I found nothing close to an entire almond...the biggest was maybe a third of one half of a single nut! REALLY?! That is nuts!  I am sick of companies cheaping out on consumers.  For my entire 58 yr. life, my favorite chocolate, without exception, and including the likes of other crowd favorites like Godiva, has been Hershey's.  But this cost-cutting stuff by Hershey's?  How can this be true?  Okay, maybe it's acceptable to put ""pieces"" (taste like stale floor sweepings) into Halloween-sized very small bars, but, please, NOT into the larger candy bars that earned Hershey's such a great brand name!

I'm being totally honest, I am NOT using this product again. It doesn't even prove to help in weight loss. And the side effects are killer, and totally not worth it.

At no time would I ever describe it as Cookies and Cream, it more of an overly sweetened bad vanilla?  I can't quite put my finger on what the flavor is.

If only it were possible for humans to survive on such simple yet delicious means.  If only there existed small, convenient meals of comparable taste and price made just for us folks at the top of the food chain.  Well, if you're still pondering a suitable solution then look no further than Hormel Compleats.  The beef steak tips with mashed potatoes in particular are sure to delight even the most sophisticated palette. In this meal we find overwhelmingly grainy mashed potatoes paired up with bland steak cutlets swimming in an even blander sauce that I can only assume to be some kind of gravy. With this kind of savory goodness you honestly can't go wrong at this price range. To top it all off, the meat appears to be 100% free of any type of seasoning or flavor enhancement in general, so don't hesitate to pile on some of your own sauces and spices to improvise. Not since the US Army's MREs (Meals Rejected by Ethiopians) have we seen such sublime culinary innovation.  In other words, it's the best of the best!

"I bought this in bulk at Costco because I am a college student and needed something I could snack on while studying. These do require a microwavable bowl, as they come in individual packets. After eating it twice, you already get tired of the taste. It is not like regular mac and cheese at all. The noodles are sticky and after microwaving there is barely any water left to make the cheese powder mix work. It gets messy and the powder cheese crusts around the bowl. And you have to soak the bowl once you're done eating if you want to be able to get the mix out.<br />5 months later and I STILL have a few packets left. I just can't fathom to eat it. Only way I would eat the rest is if I had absolutely nothing else to eat. Save your money and buy something else.

Love twix and since I can never really find it in my area I thought I would buy it from Amazon. Great price for a box of 24 the only gripe I have is that the expiration date is right around the corner - meaning I have to start eating these things NOW!!! I would have appreciated at least a year expiration time but I only have close to 30 days to eat 24 bars. I like to eat my candy in a casual setting not in a rushed setting - but we live and learn. I took three stars away for that reason and for the reason below.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted the seller over 3 weeks ago to complain about the expiration dates and they have not returned my emails or even let me know they were concerned. They sell OLD STOCK that is expiring soon. I would not advise to buy from them and I would and will not buy from them at all again.,Wished the expiration date was out longer...,2
"I've tried 4 different flavors of The Switch brand beverages. This is my least favorite due to the overly sweet candy like taste. Truthfully I was only able to drink about 1/3 of the can before I had to put it down.  If they would lighten up on some up the more sugary juice and let the other flavors come through it might not be as bad, but even my kids thought this one was too sweet.  This may be considered a ""healthy alternative"" because it is made with fruit juice and no added sugar, but the taste says otherwise.",Way too sweet!,2
"I copy and paste from skacleve's review, because I have had almost the same experience.  I lived in Japan for 3 years and know how sencha should taste.

I've been through almost four 18-count boxes, and like skacleve, ""I've wasted [over a dozen] bags that tore open while I tried to open the wrapper, no matter how careful I was. You should be able to tear open the wrappers, but even if I cut them open, some bags were adhered to the inside of their wrapper and tore open when pulled out. The wrappers are tough plastic and the bags are very delicate. And the strings come off easily, especially while steeping in hot water.""",disappointed,2

"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.<br /><br />White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.<br /><br />As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.<br /><br />I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins).",powder instead of leaf,2

I measured it out and there was going to be enough room to actually allow my Keurig to function. However, once I recieved it, I realized I have to slide it out every time to make a cup of coffe. The drawer is oddly measured because my K-Cups fit inside with about half an inch of slack on each row. So when I do slide my Keurig out, the cups slide. Also, the rubberized ""feet"" underneath got caught on my granite countertop and I've already lost one.

"Having recently had New Orleans beignets at both Cafe Du Monde and Morning Call, I had been excited to try them at home.  I made both a Du Monde batch and a batch from scratch (using a food network recipe) and was very disappointed in the Cafe Du Monde mix.<br /><br />The box has a simple 3 step (well four if you include the ""enjoy!"" step) instruction for making the beignets: Stir together 2 cups of the mix and 7oz water, roll it out on a liberally floured surface, fry.  Unfortunately the mixing step results in a way too wet dough for rolling, unless one works in at least another 3/4 cup or more of flour. Once one has achieved a sufficiently roll-able dough the resulting beignets are okay, but not nearly as tasty as ones you could make from scratch for only slightly more effort.",Better at the cafe.. insufficient instructions.,2

"Soooo Sweet Stevia powder - about 63 cents per serving (the container is mostly soluble fiber and very little stevia)<br />NuNaturals Stevia liquid - about 8 cents per serving<br />Kal Stevia powder - about 1.5 cents per serving - THIS IS THE BETTER BUY PLUS it comes in a niftly dispenser bottle with multiple settings and it's own personal dose-size spoon.<br /><br />All had NO aftertaste when thoroughly blended in my tea.  When using in milk for cereal I blended the stevia thoroughly in a glass of milk before pouring on my cereal and all were excellent.<br /><br />Soooo Sweet is comparable with Kal or NuNaturals (regular or alcohol free) stevias as far as having NONE of the bitter aftertaste like the grocery store brand stevias do.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the Soooo Sweet because it cost $10, came in a 75 gram tub - per the label has about 16 servings (a WHOPPING average 63 cents per serving) and has soluble fiber (I guess for a filler).<br /><br />Kal 1.3 grams (no fillers) for about $14 at my local health store has 905 servings - 57 TIMES MORE STEVIA THAN Soooo Sweet - & averages 1.5 cents per serving.  Its jar top has several settings for optional serving methods all the way from a fine sprinkle, heavier sprinkle or a large opening to pour or use a handy scoop that comes with it.<br /><br />The NuNaturals liquid 2 oz bottle was around $14 at my local health food store & provides 169 servings (about 8 cent per serving) PLUS - when the bottle is empty - I have an amber glass bottle with a glass dropper to use for my home made tinctures, herbal remedies, essential oils and such.<br /><br />I saved $4 with Soooo Sweet but got 889 LESS servings.

Why not just a sturdy envelope?  I will definitely find Costa Rican coffee in my local area and buy from a brick & stick store.  Usually I try to offset the state sales tax (8.25% in  the DFW area)with the shipping and handling charge.  There seems to be a trend of increasing shipping and handling costs.  Local sales tax on this purchase would have been in the range of $0.80.

"Before trying this product, I tried making a native starter, just picking up whatever yeast was flying around in the air in Austin, Texas. That worked from a functional point of view, but had no sour flavor.<br /><br />In the process, I got myself a nice glass jar (formerly a Clausen pickle jar) punched holes in the lid. I made sure to use wooden utensils when mixing. I went to the baby aisle of the grocery store and got a bottle of distilled water to make sure there would be no chlorine present.<br /><br />Everything worked as described all over the place...very active starter...somewhat slow rising...pretty good bread texture...just no sour flavor.<br /><br />So I purchased this product.<br /><br />I followed the instructions carefully, feeding every 12 hours, using a glass container, stirring with wooden chopsticks and using distilled water.  It took three days to activate and another day or two to get very reliable...and at that point it was....indistinguishable from the local starter. No sour aroma or flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />In other words, a packet containing 1/2 tsp of ordinary flour would have worked equally well.",No Sour Taste at All,2

"I was weary about even trying this product.  I've seen them advertised for a while now, but the whole idea of a water flavorer just seemed odd to me, and I had this feeling that it was going to either be cloyingly sweet or so muted `flavor-wise' that it would resemble those bottles of cheap `flavored water' you get at Walmart.  While it can verge on too sweet at times, depending on how hard you squeeze that bottle (thus the amount of syrup you get out of a single `serving'), this really does taste pretty darn good.  It's a nice way to add some flavor to a sodaless diet (something I've been trying hard to eliminate).  I wouldn't recommend drinking this all the time (LOL at all the facts pointing to it not being good for you, and the fact that it can clean your counters), and it's odd that the aftertaste (which clings to the back of your throat) doesn't really hit you until a few minutes after you're done drinking it, but it is pretty tasty and is a nice change of pace for a day, week, month that consists of water, water and more water.<br /><br />EDIT:  Wow, so as this day wore on that aftertaste clung to the back of my throat in the grossest of ways.  Seriously, it is still there and I can't get it to go away.  It rests in the back of your mouth, and basically coats everything you eat or drink from there on out.

"Zoe Lifestyle Treats for Dogs are a healthy alternative to the typical high-calorie dog snacks which you find in stores today. The product is gluten-free and is a good source of soluble fiber. These treats are as hard as a rock which would probably be troublesome for older dogs with poor teeth. I tested these treats on a 2-year-old lab and a 9-year-old golden retriever. Keep in mind...they will eat just about anything. Both dogs threw the sticks on the ground and proceeded to sniff them.  I am not sure, but I think the cinnamon spice flavor threw them off a bit.  After rolling the sticks around on the ground, I am happy to report that they ate them. The next day, I offered them another treat and they didn't seem too excited. Overall, if you are into healthy dog food, these snacks are sensible treats. Personally, I wouldn't buy them again due to the price and the firmness of the product.

I was wrong, and was very disappointed.  This soup (bean) tastes far, far better than the Salmon Chowder variety, but was also disappointing, mainly because the hotness of the soup overpowers any other flavors!  It was hard to taste the ""smoked salmon"" at all because of this.  The texture of this soup is good and the beans were flavorful, when I could taste them over the overwhelming ""spice"" of the soup.

In fact Gristede's carries Mezzetta Martini olives and the olives and Vermouth are really delicious - not a mushy one in the bunch and the liquid makes a great dirty martini. Best, a case of six was less than this order. I've got my fingers crossed they won't be mushy when they arrive.

Before this, we were having Jim's Together Decaf Organic Coffee and though Jim's is a little more expensive, if we have to use twice as much of this coffee to get enough flavor, couldn't save anything - even then, it still didn't have as much aroma.. Maybe because these are ground coffee and with Jim's, we buy the beans at a supermarket and grind them there - I don't know. But I don't think we will use other 2 bags of this coffee...",not too flavorful,2

"The bar is a sticky mess inside a wrapper that can't be pulled away from the ""bar"".  The flavor is good, but much of the contents remain stuck to the wrapper.  If you do manage to pull the wrapping away, the contents sag and fall apart.  I have had other Kind bars and liked them, but will not buy this variety again.","Too sticky, messy",2
"If you are wondering what size the contents are, it is like receiving a Theraflu packet. The foil cover that is in the description is again, like Theraflu where you cut the top of the `foil cover' off and pour the contents into a mug with water. I then warmed the mix and water; I used extra water and warmed it up in the microwave. On the back of the contents, it reads: For Hot Serving: Pour contents, add hot water (250ml) stir and serve immediately.<br /><br />Since it calls for 1 cup of water, I used almost twice as much since I do not like strong flavors. Even with two cups, ALL I could taste was the Ginger. Don't get me wrong, I love to eat ginger, but the flavor is so overpowering. It actually hurt my throat each time I sipped it. Not from the heat of the water, but the hotness of the spices. It states it has lemon to it; I could not taste lemon at all. I tried a few sips and it hurt my throat so much I had to stop. I know ginger is good for motion sickness, I have been suffering from extreme vertigo caused by a medical condition and did not feel the effect, however, I probably did not consume enough of it. I have drunk bad tasting stuff before but this is beyond bad, it actually hurts to drink. A drink should not be painful.<br /><br />After trying to get a few sips down I had a guest over and asked if they wanted to try my drink. They agreed and the word was ""awful!""<br /><br />I know drinks and flavors vary by person but I am surprised that anyone would drink this. I can also see why it aids in digestion by your body not wanting it to stay in your body and to get out.<br /><br />I liked that it was caffeine free but the taste was the worse ever. Even worse than medicines I HAVE to take and can't stand. To those who like and love it, more power to you. I will make sure not to buy again and hope there is plenty in stock for those who do praise it.<br /><br />Sadly, I cannot recommend this at all!","Hard to swallow, painful actually.",2

"I keep several orthodox whole leaf teas around all the time, but like to have a decent quality ctc for those who can't appreciate my 3x as expensive teas. and occasionally I drink some ctc just to ""repair"" the budget.  When I saw that I could buy some ""orthodox"" high mountain Ceylon at such a reasonable price, I decided to give it a try. How bad could it be? First, not orthodox-it's ctc. Secondly, even with lowered expectations (Ceylon used to be my favorite tea before quality decreased over the last few years), this is disappointing. It is simply  a commercial product. It lacks any of the distinctive qualities of decent Ceylon. I couldn't coax a respectable cup of liquor from the leaves no matter how I brewed them. I'll use it to make a black tea mix for friends, but I won't calculate it's final cost vs quality. That way I won't have to add an antidepressant to my tea habit.<br /><br />I think generally speaking, Amazon is not the place to buy tea. This tea may be very old and may not have been handled properly. Tea is very susceptible to heat (warehouse). This was hot tot he touch when it arrived. There are other retailers who take great care in turning over inventory so as not to ship old tea. This is true even when purchasing inexpensive tea.","Good Marketing, poor product",2

"My 9 year old Tortie LOVES this food and ate it for almost three years.  When I tried to give her other food she would eat just enough to not starve and cry for other food.  However, a month ago she started throwing up once or twice every single day.  The throw-up was almost half-undigested food.  Then I noticed she was having diarrhea as well.  Additionally, during this same time period I opened up one of the bags of this food and saw cobwebs and insects inside the bag.  I returned the bag to my local food retailer and was told it was not uncommon and that they were ""onion moths"" and that the manufacturer has been having problems with them.  Add all of this together, and I had had it with this food.  I switched to Eukanuba and IMMEDIATELY the vomiting ceased and the diarrhea ceased.  I also noticed that her coat improved as well.

"We bought this (the large cube) for our eighty pound retriever. He played with it once, then it broke in half. I glued the halves back together, he played with it once more, then it broke in half again. I then put super epoxy on it and plastic-welded it back together. He played with it once, then it broke AGAIN. I finally drilled holes in the side and riveted a make-shift bracket to either half, effectively sealing the thing together for eternity (or as long as it takes for the plastic to break-down into it's constituent materials). Even now the center tube hardly ""locks"" anymore. I'm done with this toy. The manufacturer needs to redesign the cube halves so the halves screw together.<br /><br />Even when it was brand new the center lock was VERY hard for my wife to get out.

"My dog had been taking pills without issue for several months.  Due to a recent surgery, her daily pill count has gone up dramatically, and it has become increasingly difficult to get her to take them. I have heard many people saying how wonderfully these pill pockets work, so I finally decided to give them a try.  First, I think they are ridiculously expensive (although reasonable at Amazon, these cost almost 30% more at my local pet store, where I unfortunately bought them).  Second, if the pills taste bad (particularly if they are tablets that are cut in half to lower the dosage), it is likely that your dogs will still spit them out if they are anything like mine.  I was hoping for the magic solution to pill taking, but this is not it.","My dog can still taste the pills, and spits them out",2
"I don't like to think of myself as a waffle connoisseur but when it comes to breakfast, everything else can take a hike. I bought my first waffle iron on Black Friday and immediately began scouring the Internet for a waffle mix of epic proportions. I was super excited to purchase this product given the amount of positive reviews it had gained. Sadly, I was swept up in the hype and came in expecting something that just wasn't there.<br /><br />The instructions were simple enough and I definitely can't complain about the size. These three large cans could last a good 2-3 months if prepared once or twice a week. I didn't buy the product because it was all natural (that was more like an added bonus). I wanted substance and flavor and that's something this product just couldn't deliver. I made the batter exactly as instructed, not even adjusting the measurement to a single serving and gave it a whirl. After my first bite I swore to myself that I missed something. That must have been it. These things couldn't be bland, not after hearing so many good things about them but alas, the truth was a hard pill to swallow.<br /><br />I didn't give up on this mix after one batch and began my quest to vary the ingredients. I tried adding more sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and practically everything under the sun to elevate some flavor from this batter but it just wasn't working. I have to macerate these waffles in syrup and butter just to enjoy them but I was really hoping for a flavorful treat right out of the box.<br /><br />These waffles aren't bad but they aren't really that good either. The texture is nice when cooked and if you know what you're doing, you can get a nice crispy crust while still leaving it a little soft in the middle. I will give it credit for that but as far as everything else is concerned this package leaves much more to be desired.",Hyped beyond all belief,2

The cans came with recipes for cooked chicken dishes but I can't imagine that the chicken has any more flavor cooked than it does cold and straight out of the can.  If you love good chicken flavor in your chicken salad, buy the chicken and cook it yourself because you won't get it with this product.","No taste, very bland.....",2

When he was finished with the Milk Bone, he picked the Beggin' Strip.

"I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired).

While the aroma is wonderful (spicy, warm and sweet), the taste is watery and leaves an after taste like bad artificial sweetener.  And it is heavy on the sweet.  I tried a couple of cups and didn't finish either.  I wish Keurig could come up with a latte K-Cup that tastes like Latte.  I love all the coffees, teas and even the hot cider but anything that I've tried that should have had a creamy consistency like hot chocolate, white hot chocolate or this chai latte have all been watery and unpleasant.

I purchased a six pack and began using it to make my replication of the Starbucks peppermint mocha (non-fat, no whip) that I take to work most days of the week.  I use a Bialetti stovetop pot and the Starbucks espresso roast, plus the Starbucks peppermint syrup.<br /><br />My old recipe, a perfect match, was 2 tablespoons of Starbucks natural mocha powder mixed with 2 tablespoons of Starbucks peppermint syrup, 2 tablespoons of hot water, and 1 tablespoon of Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Add 2/3 cup of espresso and 16 ounces of steamed, nonfat milk to make a ""venti"" sized (20 ounce).<br /><br />I thought that this sauce would simplify things by replacing both the Hershey's syrup and the mocha powder and hot water, but using 3 tablespoons of it left a somewhat chocolate-flavored, but overly sweet result with an almost metallic aftertaste.

"After looking at a site that referenced 5-hour energy and finding out that NALT (N-Acetyl, L-Tyrosine) was an ingredient, I went to wikipedia to find out the other ingredients and lo and behold all five major cognitive-enhancing supplements (I'm including the B-Complex Vitamins here)including in this drink were the four that constituted my core stack for mental-intensive tasks (I substitute Alpha-GPC for CDP-Choline on occasion, due to it's effectiveness at crossing the blood-brain barrier .

It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary.

I felt it was a little heavy on the dried plums (that's what we call prunes now, thanks to the boys in marketing for that one), but otherwise it was a respectable mix of fruit. My problems with this product began when I looked more closely at the ingredients.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients, directly from the package:<br /><br />California Pitted Dried Plums, Dried Mediterranean Apricots (Product of Turkey), Dried California Peaches, Dried Pears (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apricots (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apples (Products of Chile, China or Argentina), Medium Chain Triglycerides (from coconut and/or palm kernel)* and Natural Flavoring. Sulfur Dioxide and/or Sodium Bisulfate and/or Potassium Sorbate added as preservatives.<br /><br />* Adds a trivial amount of fat.<br /><br />I have two main issues with this:<br /><br />1. The apples are not from the United States. To be clear, I don't have a problem with imported fruit; it offers consumers year-round availability of things that otherwise might only be available for a couple months. But why are we importing apples into the U.S.? Don't we grow, like, a bazillion of these things every year? And from China no less? If I visited China, it would be risky for me to eat the fruit... is it somehow okay when it's dried out and sold here?<br /><br />2. There's fat added to fruit. Sure, it's a ""trivial"" amount, but why is this even happening at all? It's fruit, it doesn't need fat added to it, especially in triglyceride form.<br /><br />Now, neither of these issues are the end of the world... but I feel like I can do better. I noticed the availability of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAUKP4"">Mariani Mixed Fruit</a>, made by the same company, but without Chinese apples or triglycerides listed among the ingredients.

I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves.

"I have been drinking coconut water for several years and have tried almost every brand. I finally found the best one - by a long shot: Taste Nirvana brand. Still, when I saw CoCo Libre Organic coconut water on sale at a local store, I immediately purchased one to compare it. If I hadn't been so thirsty, I would have tossed it after the first swallow. It's the latest in a series of ""natural"" coconut waters that are anything but. It tastes cooked, tastes like it has additives in it (it's from concentrate) and it tastes flat and slightly plasticky. It's really unappealing to me. The fact that  you can reseal the bottle is nice, but no reason to subject yourself to an inferior product. Taste Nirvana is incrediblly light and fresh; it seems like my cells just absorb it instantly. There is no aftertaste and the product is fantastic from batch to batch. I like the size in the cans, but Taste Nirvana also comes in resealable bottles that are the same size as Coco Libre. Do yourself a favor and buy Taste Nirvana instead. No, I am not affiliated in any way with the company, but I do really respect and support products that are clean, as close to truly natural as possible, and delicious.

"Lea & Perrins' Worcestershire sauce is wonderful stuff that's been made to a secret recipe since 1838. Doubtless the recipe's undergone some tweaking over the last 170+ years, but the version that's been sold in the US for the past few years has, until VERY recently, contained high fructose corn syrup. As noted in the product info above, yep, what's being sold here is the HFCS-filled recipe.<br /><br />Heinz has actually removed HFCS from the US recipe earlier this year (see the latest ingredients on the L&P website) but unless and until the product information is updated for this item, I'd assume that this is old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, if you can find the bottles of L&P with orange labels, which I've seen for sale in quite a few stores, those are guaranteed not to contain any HFCS as they're imported from the UK.<br /><br />Kudos to Heinz for listening to their customers though - Mr. Lea and Mr. Perrins can stop rolling in their graves now!","NOT ""The Original"" L&P at all - this contains HFCS!",2

"I was disappointed. My darling child has been diagnosed gluten intolerant, so I bought her cookie mix. This mix is made from sweet brown rice flour, which makes them VERY gritty -- like they have sand in them. Also, it gives the cookies a weird flavor -- kind of plasticky.<br /><br />My sweet child won't eat them because of the texture, so it's useless to me. I've tried putting cocoa and chocolate chips in them. I've tried putting chocolate chips, butter, and a little molasses (to simulate brown sugar).

It's 3:00am and the guilt from watching the last P90X infomercial while eating ice cream had just worn off.  Suddenly as if Billy Maze himself had yelled it through my TV - I got the craving for some Peanut Brittle.<br /><br />Not being one who needs instant gratification I turned to my old friends at Amazon. I figured ... If I were to order food, sight unseen ... peanut brittle in fact, it seems reasonable to order form a company called THE PEANUT COMPANY of Virginia.<br /><br />Well - The items arrives well wrapped and protected from Amazon with no visible damage to the outside of the box.

"People who take candy seriously are a vulnerable group.  So why name a straightforward candy ""nerds""?  It seems like you are poking fun at your supporters.  Especially for the sour ones (which are I think the best), the conventional thing would be to call them something like ""McGillicutty's"" and have a picture of a scowling Irishman.  The candy itself is just going to be sugar, corn syrup, stabilizers and some flavoring--the name is what gives you a sense of what it is.<br /><br />In general, the Wonka lines have been a depressing experience.  First, no one should have been so cynical as to use the name ""Willy Wonka"" for real candy.  It's like Fruit of the Loom having ""Thomas Jefferson"" briefs.  And I'll get back to that.  But second, the candy has consistently been uninventive, third rate, and with no particular appeal.  All it does is drag W.W.'s image into the ground as opposed to it being an inspiration.<br /><br />And as we all know, Wonka is now actually a part of Nestle's.  Now as someone previously in the candy business, I have to say that Nestle's main-line and high-quality line products in the candy/chocolate world are pretty good.  But as a company, Nestle is a nightmare--poisoning pets, starving babies.  If Nestle owned the real Willy Wonka factory, the Oompa-Loompas would turn out to be slaves.  I just can't understand a world in which Nestle owns the right to put out low grade candy and call it Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Willy Wonka represented the dream of doing good, being a child, and being honest.  That was why Charlie got the factory--because he precisely wasn't the kind of guy who would go far in Nestle's.  I feel like in this product, Nestle is basically saying to Charlie, ""you're a nerd!  Maybe you can work in the tech department programming the payroll computers!  But you sure as heck can't run the factory and we're not interested in any of your spacey ideas!""<br /><br />And one last thing--if you're my age, you've probably had to listen, more than you wanted to, to the song ""Nurds"" (the spelling was ""charmingly"" wrong) by the Roches.  Now if there's one thing you don't want associated with your candy product, it's roaches.  Animal contamination is always a real threat, and it's often not taken seriously enough.  So, Nestle, when you were done with your ethically-dubious activities in the third world, you somehow chose a name for a candy that would both spit in the face of Charlie Bucket and make the consumer queasy.  Who's running this show? [15]",Could you have a worse name for a candy?,2

"I researched every available baby food maker on amazon.com and this one seemed to be the best bang for the buck. It steams and then purees the food in one fell swoop.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Steams quickly and throughly, as long as food is cut into small chunks.<br />-Has a steam and puree setting, so little handling or work on your part until the food is ready to eat. However, the instructions do suggest that you first drain the container when cooking foods that have a high water content.<br />-Makes enough for a new eater to have food for a week. You won't be spending all your time making baby food, because who has time for that?<br />-Fruits and vegetables are blended to a smooth consistency, great for new eaters.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Removal of food and clean-up is a pain, because the blades do not come off easily. Blades slip onto the top of the container, and food and water can slip down the opening once the blades are removed.<br />-Water gets into the drive shaft while steaming, and I am pretty sure the instructions said not to immerse the drive shaft in water. Not sure how this will affect future functioning.<br />-Machine seems to run out of water for steaming pretty quickly, sometimes in the middle of steaming.<br />-You must purchase a separate insert to steam grains. I tried cooking and pureeing oatmeal on the steam & puree setting, and had to add water several times, and the consistency was rough. The instructions do not tell you how to go about cooking grains so I am assuming the insert comes with those instructions.<br /><br />However, I am returning this item because the blades have started to chip, the stainless steel on the lid is starting to rust, and the plastic handle has broken.

"When i received my fly trap all of the traps were closed so i called the ""help line"" and asked the guy if that was normal. the man on the other line spoke such poor english i could hardly understand him, i had to get him to repeat everything he said. he told me that the heads closed were ok that they would open in a few weeks i was like well ok, so about a week passes and the traps still are closed and they begin to get black spots on them so i call the help line again and he says oh thats normal  it should go away in about a week . so time goes on and still the traps remain closed and the black has completely covered two of them. so i read online that if they get black spots on them to immediately pop the head off and a new one should grow back, so i did but the rest of the leaf just got really black and began to limp over.  ive had my fly trap for about 3 and a half weeks now  and they still haven't lost the black on them, one of the heads have opened but it is dead. i did EXACTLY what the instructions said to do but still no luck. dont be fooled by the photo on this item it is NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE SIZE IN THE PHOTO. it is maybe a third of the size in the photo. very disappointed!",fly trap,2

"I am extremely sensitive to MSG, sulfites, etc. - they give me terrible migraines.  Although this mix says ""no msg"" it DOES contain sulfites, so if a glass or two of wine gives you a headache (wine typically contains sulfites), then this pickling spice may give you migraines/headaches as well.  This is just an FYI to the folks like me who have to be careful what they eat and drink. The sulfites in this pickling blend are used a preservative, which is completely unnecessary in my opinion.  McCormick simply wishes to ensure an indefinite shelf life for this stuff at the expense of individuals' health.<br /><br />PS - I love to make pickles, jellies and preserves, etc., and to give them as gifts.

"When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me that this flavor, the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.","Decent, but not great",2

In addition to tiny amounts of real cinnamon they added very unpleasant artificial cinnamon/streusel flavoring. Why would anyone do such thing?? It ruined everything. Cinnamon tastes good on it's own. Does anyone put artificial flavors in their cinnamon rolls? On top of that they threw in some red #40 and sorbitol, it leaves a bad aftertaste especially if you eat cereal on an empty stomach (this is how I eat my cereal :o)) Artificial sweeteners make sense for  those who can not have sugar, but why put sorbitol if it already has syrup/sugar in it or vice versa?? It doesn't taste good, nothing like real cinnamon or cinnamon streusel, wheats are rock hard (they are not the same as originals) and have a weird texture.

"I generally don't write bad product reviews, but in this case I'll make an exception. I switched from using sugar in my coffee to agave due to the low glycemic index, but also because it seemed simple to use, and the liquid is much easier to dissolve if I wanted to use it in a cooler liquid, such as iced tea. This was the first agave I ever purchased, and I am now a big fan. However, that is IN SPITE OF this Xagave product, NOT because of it. The bottle design for this agave nectar was beyond frustrating to me. The design of the bottles included a clear plastic top, which came off completely, and a little nub with a hole on it that you pulled up so that you could squirt agave out, and then pushed back in when you were done (kind of like an old-school water bottle), and then you put the clear plastic top back on again. There is NO way this design was actually tested by a conscious living human before it was putt into production. You could not use this product without leaving at least a tiny bit of agave around the spout thing every single time you used it. The next morning, you left a little more, and so on and so forth, until the top of the bottle (including the little plastic top thing) were so disgusting and sticky that I actually started to dread my normal cup of coffee every morning. I literally counted down the days until we were finished with this product (yes, I refused to waste it by throwing it out); not because I planned on quitting agave. No, only because I wanted to quit making a sticky disgusting mess every morning with my coffee. Honestly, I can't believe I'm the first one to complain about this. Am I the only one who received this type of dispenser top? Is this some sort of elaborate agave practical joke?<br /><br />Bottom line, I like agave. Strongly support it. I hate this bottle. In my nightmares, a giant version of this bottle leaves sticky puddles of disgustingness that I get stuck in until the end of time. Until the bottle design is changed, don't buy it. I've used other agave and it has all tasted just as good. Buy one that won't frustrate you with each use.<br /><br />Note: If the bottle has changed in any way, someone please comment on my review and say so, and I will change my review to reflect that. As of today (09-14-11), one of the pictures Amazon is using looks like it has a different dispenser/tap than mine, while another picture shows the same tap I had on my bottles. A flip-top would basically solve all of my complaints; I switched to a different brand (Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Blue Agave), and the flip-top design is perfect.",Worst dispenser design I've ever experienced,2
We bought these for the Senseo- the ad says it is compatable but its not! Buyers beware- I almost broke my Senseo trying to use them- The Senseo got stuck closed and I had to wait for it to let go of the vacuum. I think its because there is more coffee in these.,Do not use in Senseo,2

"Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup.

"This review is specific to the Bigelow Chinese Oolong Tea<br /><br />After drinking this tea several times from whole leaves, I admit I made a mistake in purchasing it as tea bags...even if the product comes in individual packed tea bags and under the Bigelow brand.  The Wulong/Oolong whole leaf tea is an aromatic, delightful tea - golden in colour and has a wonderful taste that does not require sweetening.  The tea bags are nothing like it.  It smells like regular tea (like a Lipton, or any other generic), the colour is dark and the flavor nothing special; even after sweetening with honey or sugar it does not improve.<br /><br />If you want to experience the delight of drinking Oolong tea, do not get it like this.

Sadly these bags are not strong enough to do the job. I've tried to double them up but that becomes a pain in the keester and is expensive to boot.

I found the packaging extremely poor as well. I would have expected a roll of bags that are self-dispensing as most trash bags are.

So we got it thinking it'd be *somewhat* similar.  Well it wasn't.  My hubby complained so much that it tasted weird and he just didn't like it (at first he thought the milk was rotten, and replaced that...but it wasn't a milk problem).  Then I had it, and thought, well, it was edible but just not great.<br /><br />I don't know how to describe the weirdness (it's not rotten or anything)...perhaps ""PLAIN Cap'n Crunch cereal, with a Teensy bit of peanut butter just tossed in without reworking the whole package to make sure it works"" ? And maybe the two just don't go together that easily? i.e. if they toss in peanut butter, they'll need to modify the base at least somewhat to make things taste ok at the end?  Or maybe all the peanut butter gets washed away when milk is added?  Regardless of the reason, the cereal just didn't work.  Unless of course you have different expectations, and DON'T expect it to be SOMEWHAT like Reese's Puffs :) And don't really care much about peanut butter anyway, plus have different taste buds than us (or just careless ones), then the cereal may be fantabulous for you! Who knows :)",Looks like 'Reese's Puffs' Copycat...But Barely hint of peanut butter & Strange overal taste...Reese's Puff's MUCH better!,2

"Well, I thought I had done my research. I am not new to bread making, but was wanting to add that malty taste to some of my loaves.

I have since seen that info on line as well! OMG! The loaf never baked and stayed completely gummy.I've never seen the like. Upon further research, this flour is not what I had thought it was. The info out there and in baking books on barley flour is not complete and very misleading. Now I have 4 bags of this stuff. I wasted a lot of money for something you don't even need to make a good loaf of bread. I think what I need for my malt flavor is simply Malt Extract. I should have figured that out since my husband brews beer. I didn't think this WAS Malt extract, but I thought it was going to be the thing to use in breads! As it turns out this is diastatic malt and breaks down the starches in the flour. Why would you need that when white flour is already a refined starch? I MIGHT add a teaspoon or two of this to a 100% whole grain loaf, but what to do with 4 bags?

Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand.

"I think that this Liptons To Go Green Tea Mix tastes OK, but I prefer real tea. My wife likes this Lipton's Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix. She likes the mild strawberry flavor.<br /><br />But it is not as natural as Lipton advertises. Lipton's product info states, ""Lipton Tea & Honey ... is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it's made with real ingredients ... blended with honey and strawberry and acai flavors ... Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors ... flavor with other natural flavor ... and no aspartame.""<br /><br />So what's there to not like about that? Well it's not all real ingredients and sweetened with just honey. The fine print discloses that it includes Sucralose (sweetener). Shane Ellison calls himself ""The People's Chemist"" and is the author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402225059"">Over the Counter Natural Cures: Take Charge of Your Health in 30 Days with 10 Lifesaving Supplements for under $10</a>. Shane was a big pharma chemist who quit when he discovered that the drugs that he was creating for the big pharma companies were nothing more than toxins and the real cures were natural and didn't require a prescription. Shane says that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose (Splenda) have serious problems. Studies show that they lead to weight gain and even pre-diabetes. Artificial sweeteners ""disrupt the body's natural calorie counter"" and ""put the users at much higher risk for being obese and insulin resistant."" Shane says that Sucralose, 1,6-Dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-'-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-'-D-galactopyranoside, contains a historically deadly, nasty form of chlorine (RNFOC), which yields poisons such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides. ""An RNFOC can invade every nook and cranny of the body ... and may result in weakened immune function, irregular heartbeat, agitation, shortness of breath, skin rashes, headaches, liver and kidney damage, birth defects, and cancer. Hiding its origin, sucralose pushers assert that it is 'made from sugar'. Sucralose is as close to sugar as glass cleaner is to purified water. France recently banned such false advertising statements. The deceit has been ignored within the United States.""<br /><br />Why does the FDA allow this? Shane says science was sold out for profit. ""Just like chemists manipulate the properties of matter, Big Pharma manipulates studies using 'checkbook science.' This allows them to pay for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. Checkbook science isn't illegal by FDA standards. It's been going on for over 20 years. Known as the Bayh-Dole Act, US law was amended in 1980 to permit flagrant conflicts of interest, ones that allow the industry to design drug trials and hire experts to conjure up favorable results at will.""<br /><br />So if you want something natural, look for Shane Ellison's book and skip this Lipton's tea mix.",It's not as natural as Lipton advertises,2

Seeing as how other reviewers loved this cereal, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />When the cereal arrived, I was excited to give it a taste. I poured myself a bowl of fat free milk and got seated at the table. The cheerios-looking bits certainly looked very good, so I happily took a big spoonful of milk and cereal and delightfully took my first bite. Strangely, I could not taste the cinnamon.

I struggled to finish my cereal bowl, only managing to finish the bowl by reminding myself of the nutritional value it provided.<br /><br />I would give this cereal a 1-star rating, but considering it does contain a whole lot of fiber, I am bumping this to a 2.

"By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price.

I tried mixing it in water, milk even yogurt (that was a huge mistake) and it just never tasted ok enough to choke down.  I'm not a picky eater either. I know these powders are funky, I expected that.  But this stuff was over the top funky.  When I mixed it in yogurt, it got super sticky and was sort of like wall paper paste.  It tastes nothing like chai.  I'm not sure why I they call it that.  I haven't tried making into a smoothy with lots of honey and cinnamon and other spices.

This item appeared to meet that criteria.  Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it was not only berries, but also oil and sweetener.  Instead of plumping up when rehydrated in my morning milk, they did not change at all.  They were much more a sweet snack than a true blueberry flavor.

"Approximately one month ago, we needed to start supplementing with formula as my milk supply wasn't enough for our 5 month old. I wanted to provide the best possible alternative and came up with Baby's Only. I agree that the ingredients are great...nutritious without any unnecessary extras. She seemed to do ok when I made bottles with half breastmilk and half formula. However, this past week we have gone to full formula bottles and unfortunately she hasn't been able to tolerate it. The powder is thick and doesn't dissolve very well. So I end up stirring it which causes a ton of air bubbles. This has in turn caused some major gas pains and sleepless nights for her. I also noticed that she was starting to become constipated. Reluctantly, I switched to a mainstream brand of formula and she has been doing great. It dissolves almost immediately, no air bubbles and looks a lot like my own milk.","Great product, but didn't work out",2

"Let me start by saying this is not really bad jerky.  I took issue to two of the descriptions on the bag.  The first is that this in my opinion is not ""HOT"".  One would thing that Habanero jerky would at least elicit some type of heat in the mouth, tears, etc.  I did not find that to be the case & was quite disapointed.  I also do not believe this jerky to be very ""tender"".  The first two pieces I ate almost have the consistency of shoe leather & were very tough to chew through.

"I have to admit, it's nice that Petite Cuisine doesn't have the standard nasty canned cat food smell to it. It actually looks and smells decent, compared to the stuff I'm used to. It also has an overall healthier list of ingredients than most canned cat foods. Normally, that would add up to a five-star meal. The problem is, our cat won't eat the stuff! Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff! Overall a disappointing experience on this end, but it's worth a try because every cat is different. You may find that it suites your cat's tastes just fine.",Good...

They licked it a few times, pushed the ball around a few times, and that was it.  They could not figure out how to get out the little treats inside, because there are flaps covering the opening, which you bend to pop in the little treats.

"My family has loved this cereal for around 7 years or so before they ruined it. Also, the taste of the new sugar version is very poor. We have tried O's cereals without sugar from our local Whole Foods Market as well as Barbara's, but we don't really like them. For some reason, nothing stands up to the old version of Purely O's. We have now substituted Amaranth Flakes by Arrowhead Mills, which is a superior yet delicious cereal in my opinion (as well as my 2 little girls' and husband's opinions). We have abandoned O's cereals for now, not being able to really like Barbara's or WF's versions, but we will buy them if the original Purely O's cereal ever comes back. Certainly, if Cascadian Farms won't listen to its customers, then some other company should hopefully seize a great opportunity here. Especially since O's are so beloved by and wonderful for (developmentally) toddlers, who may grow to love them young, and keep them as a staple in their diet for years, perhaps for a lifetime. The opportunity for a company here is strengthened further by the huge market of devoted parents of young children who will seek out the healthiest version of O shaped cereal that their children will eat and enjoy... and will even pay a bit more for the higher quality.

I just could not get a moist cake from this mix.","We tried, but it's dry",2
"I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans.",Most of the Cans Were Dented,2
This composition of this chew is too easy for a dog to bite off chunks.  It does not last long and poses a choking hazard.,Himalayan Chew,2
"The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.","Roller Jams, Wasted Product",2

"Where, oh where can you find a tea strainer that doesn't leak?  These Tuffy Steepers are cute, look practical and easy to use, but they fail at their basic purpose...straining the tea and keeping leafs out of the brew.  They collapse into easily transportable shapes, come with a little lid that serves as a base for the hot, wet strainer when finished, they're dishwasher safe...but they don't keep the loose tea out of the brew!  Infuriating.  Plus, they're awful big and take up a lot of room in the cup, so when you remove the steeper, you're left with a 1/2 cup of tea.  One other thing, there's a funky clip that you can see in the pictures.  It's a small plastic thing that extends out over the steeper, for what purpose I can't tell.  It might have been better designed where it repositioned to extend out and down, so you could clip it over the rim of the cup to steady the thing.  I was disappointed by these.  Great looks, little function.  My hunt continues.","Great Idea, Poor Execution",2
"From the name and the description, I was expecting a creamy drink.  This is just coffee with a little caramel flavoring, barely enough to taste.  I'd rather have plain coffee than this.

It's sweet and creamy and I don't have to add a thing to make it taste the way I want it to. Great for a special treat to myself.

I received the shipment, no real complaints there, but was disappointed that 40% was French Vanilla from two different companies. Out of 35 cups that's 40% of total.

"I really wanted to love these. I waited so long to try them because of all the Thinkfruit varieties, this is the most expensive one. While most of the Thinkfruit varieties only have sugar, maybe a little oil, and/or ""natural flavors"" added, this blueberry variety has malic acid added. I don't know if this is causing the problem for me but the blueberries tasted ""off"" to me. Nothing like a dried blueberry. I looked it up and (simplified), malic acid provides a tart flavor and that's not what I'm tasting. I'm not tasting blueberry either.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because I can stand them if I rinse them or soak them in something before using them for baking or consuming. Once rinsed and soaked, they taste much better, regardless of what I had to soak them in.

"I can't stand aspartame and Splenda because of the chemical aftertaste, but I read good things about stevia and glucose tolerance (search PubMed on NIH's website for stevia), so wanted to give it a try.  I can definitely tell the difference between sugar and Truvia.  It leaves sort of a woody/licorice aftertaste in my mouth, but the taste does not linger as long as the aftertaste from Splenda.  Truvia is not nearly as unpleasant as Splenda, but I think I would prefer tea or coffee unsweetened over sweetened with Truvia.<br /><br />Just to prove that I wasn't being unconsciously biased against Truvia, I asked my husband to brew a pot of coffee, split it equally into two measuring cups, and add 2 teaspoons of sugar to one cup and 1 packet of Truvia to the other.  (In case this seems somewhat arbitrary, Truvia states that 1 packet is equal to about 2 teaspoons of sugar, in sweetness.)  I didn't want down two cups of coffee at once, so I drank several shot glasses of the differently-sweetened coffee.  After several blind taste tests, I could tell which one was Truvia and which one was sugar every time.  Also, the aftertaste seemed to get worse as the coffee cooled.<br /><br />My husband could also tell the difference between Truvia and sugar, but he didn't seem to mind the taste very much.  A friend of ours can't tell the difference between Truvia and sugar at all.  So before you spring for a box (or 6 boxes, on Amazon) of Truvia, as it is fairly expensive compared to Splenda or sugar, you should try a packet or two elsewhere first.<br /><br />As for how sweet it is compared to sugar - it seems plenty sweet to me but I usually don't put a lot of sugar in my drinks.  Some suggestions to mitigate the aftertaste are:  put it in a hot drink (and drink it while it's hot), or put it in a drink with lots of other flavors to mask it, like strong chai (I could still taste it through the chai, but it's not as bad), or use half sugar and half Truvia.","There is definitely an aftertaste, but better than Splenda or aspartame.",2

It is a natural ingredient derived from seaweed, but is said to cause digestive problems.  Most doggie treats do not contain carrageenan so this is the only ingredient that may have caused a reaction in my dog.

That only helped marginally.<br /><br />I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had.

Unfortunately, I can't tolerate the resulting smell, which is an integral part of the perceived flavor when eaten.<br /><br />In short, if you're a huge coconut fan, or if your sense of smell is inoperative, then these might be for you. If you are an occasional consumer of coconut, then proceed with great caution.",Coconut shrimp--coconut flavor OVERPOWERING...,2

I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful..

"Though I wasn't expecting a lot from a soft toy, I was hoping that this would be able to provide a little more relief for my teething pup.  While the bone is easy to use and freeze, the actual 'enjoyment' time is limited and not worth the time it takes to refreeze.  After about 5 minutes, the bone was thawed to the point it was dripping and could easily have holes chewed in the fabric.  When I went to refreeze it, my poor pup didn't understand why I was taking her toy and ended up becoming disinterested very quickly the next time I brought it out.<br /><br />Another issue I hadn't thought about until after freezing is how hard and heavy the bone becomes.

"I purchased this coffee along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZI9VSQ"">La Crema's Hazelnut flavored coffee</a> and they were both very weak. While I found the flavor of St Nick's Nog to be somewhat better than that of the hazelnut, both required two tablespoons per cup in my drip maker to brew a drinkable cup. This effectively doubles the cost of the coffee, making it one of the most expensive coffees I've ever purchased.<br /><br />Update: I threw out the remainder of this coffee shortly after writing this review. The coffee wasn't enjoyable and began to feel like a chore to drink. I originally gave this coffee one star more than I gave the hazelnut for what I perceived as a somewhat better flavor. I'll leave that extra star, but only for this coffee's more pronounced flavor, which helps cover the same bitterness found in the hazelnut, and also because the hazelnut was that bad.

"I grew up loving Breakfast Treats.  They had a light crisp texture, a pleasant, light sweet taste, not too sweet and not too bland.  It was just right.  They were delicious straight out of the package (my favorite, nice and crisp), dunked in milk, or with tea.  I noticed over the past couple of years that they taste different and are harder than they used to be.<br /><br />I've also noticed less variety of Stella D'oro products.  I've lived in NY my whole life and SD was always on store shelves.  A few of my family's old favorites are no longer available.  There used to be several good cookies.  The Anginettis, Angel Wings, Swiss Fudge, Christmas variety box...I don't see any of these in stores.  Angel Wings are listed on their website, but I haven't seen them lately.  My second favorite to the Breakfast Treats, the Pfeffernusse, was only available during the holiday season, like the variety box.  I looked forward to getting 2 or 3 packages every December.  It's gone, too.<br /><br />It seems they've cut down to 4 cookie varities, 3 Breakfast Treat flavors, and several types of biscotti and toasts.  I don't like biscotti or toasts much, and the ones I see from SD always look hard and dry.  They still make breadsticks, but they are very hard to chew.  My mom used to love them but she doesn't buy them anymore.  We used to love to browse the SD displays, now I just glance at them and think how boring it looks and go on my way.<br /><br />Apparently the company was sold to Nabisco many years ago, then sold to Lance 2 years ago, which makes Archway.  Sorry but I do not like Archway cookies.  At least Nabisco kept the Breakfast Treats and other products the way they had been in the 80s.  Until about 5 years ago when the products were arriving unusally dark/overcooked.  Now the factory moved, and recipes changed to inferior versions of the originals.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />The new Breakfast Treats are not awful, there are much worse cookies available than these.  They are okay, that's why I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1.  But there is a very noticeable, unpleasant difference compared to the ones before.  They taste cheaper, have a different texture, and are probably made with cheaper ingredients.

"This is definitely a downgrade from the standard chewy chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />These cookies are supposed to be just like chewy chips ahoy cookies filled with a ""gooey fudgey"" center.  There are three problems: first, the cookies appear a little burned when you open the pack.  Second, there are many more broken cookies than usual.  Finally, the center is not gooey, even at 80 degrees F.<br /><br />In fact, I microwaved a couple of cookies to see what I could do.  Even after just five seconds, the outside disintegrated, but the inside failed to get gooey.  I think there's just too little cookie and the center is too solid - it's about the consistency of the ""stuff"" in the middle of an oreo.<br /><br />Ok, so it can't all be bad, right?  Well, the cookie isn't even as good as regular ones because it's a bit burnt and greasy, and the fudgey bit in the middle is tasty but not really good enough.  The main issue is that the cookie isn't structurally sound enough to stay intact around that ""gooey fudgey"" center, and the middle part isn't better than the cookie it replaces.<br /><br />So I did what anyone would do and took them into work to get rid of them.  They lasted a shade under 4 hours on a floor of 30 people, and there were a lot of small pieces left behind.

"I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.<br /><br />Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.<br /><br />So at first taste, this is rather sweet.

Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.<br /><br />Not very good.",Tastes like bubblegum,2
"I know there are excellent reviews on this crust. It even smells great when it comes out of the bag but that is where it ended for me. I am a celiac as well but I will find an alternative crust or not eat pizza. I thought this stuff tasted horrible. It doesn't cook right, even following the directions to a T.

"I placed an order in October 25th 2011, and received in the next week. The products were supposed to be good by February 2012.  Knowing this is organic product, I did not have problem with that. It tasted great. Good portion for little kids. However, I just found out some of the cartons started leaking and grew mold (and it is still mid January!). It must be packaging issue. I have seen the same company having packing issues with baby jar food. I am very sorry that we wasted about the half of what we have gotten because we really liked them! We will have to pick different ones next time.",Too Organic,2
"I was skeptical about ordering what with the trouble of the cups exploding, but I didn't have any of that trouble. I did find, however, that it just wasn't full-bodied enough for me.  It left me wanting.  I can usually brew an 8 oz cup from my K-cups but truthfully even brewing at 6 oz I still didn't get the rich flavor I craved. So I've been finishing up the box by brewing it at 2 or 4 oz and adding a different K-cup brand to the mug.  I'd stir clear of this one.",Fair to midland,2
"My problem with this coffee is that it is too light. I can't brew it on the 10oz setting because by the time its about half done it looks like water dripping down. I tried it today on 8oz which was a little better but still very light. No I am not a strong coffee person. I prefer medium blends so I was surprised at how light this was. Otherwise I do like the coconut flavor, its not overpowering and its not too light but I won't buy again.",Coffee is too light,2
"I'd already tried a couple of other varieties of this line and had liked them, so I expected to like this flavor as well, However, this tea has an unpleasant flowery aftertaste that makes it feel as though I'm drinking perfume.

"As someone who really enjoys a Chai Tea Latte from time to time, I was really excited when I saw this product and read some of the rave reviews! When I brewed the first one I was impressed right away by the presentation and aroma. However, when I took the first sip it was almost too sweet to drink. It tastes like liquid caramel with a hint of spice. Personally I prefer my Chai with more spice and not much sweet, so this was not what I was looking for. If you do like sweet drinks, though, everything else about this was 5 star. So, I guess it depends on preference. Wish I had ordered this in a sampler because I don't think I'll be able to finish them all.",WAY too SWEET for me!,2
"I give my two small dogs a spoon of pumpkin every night - the vet recommended it and they love it!  The quality and taste of this product seems to be fine for them - they eat it without complaint.  However, the issue is that more than half of the cans were SEVERELY dented.  Since the box was intact and whole, the cans were clearly already in this condition when placed in the box and shipped.  Because of the degree of denting on the cans, I could only safely use about 2/3 of the package.  Big picture - great product but you are being shipped cans the store won't sell because of the denting.  If you can accept that not all cans will be usable, this is good product.

"Okay, the bottom line for this food is that my cat, Buster, wouldn't eat it.  He LOVES canned cat food usually, but is 13 1/2 years old and rather finicky now.  He likes just about any kind of Fancy Feast, though once in a while, being a cat, he will turn up his nose even at that.<br />But I couldn't get him to do more than lick some of the gravy off the first serving I gave him of these chicken-flavored items. Subsequent offerings were met with the floor-scratching response (cat owners usually know this, but the cat is using the same gesture he uses in the litter box, effectively saying ""This stuff is c***!"").<br />My friends who have cats don't give them canned food - so I have most of this stuff left in my basement awaiting a hungry, interested feline consumer.<br />The product is made in Thailand, which is too close to China for my comfort, anyway.

I considered not using this product at ALL once I noticed it was from Thailand.<br />But Buster made the call, so I didn't have to.",Uh-oh,2

"A few weeks ago I bought two boxes of packaged chestnut product from Costco (don't remember the brand). That was the first time I bought pre-packaged chestnut. It was peeled, perfectly cooked, and delicious!! Unfortunately they were no longer in stock when I went back and tried to purchased it again. So I went online and found this product on amazon.<br /><br />I signed up for subscribe-and-save, and I figured I would have a long term relationship with this product. Shipping was prompt and the package arrived in good condition. I tore open a bag and was eager to give myself a treat. Then I saw them, the dark (nearly black), soggy, soft chestnuts half-naked hidden inside the mushy shells. I was thinking to myself, hmm, this doesn't look like something delicious. Reluctantly I peeled one chestnut and put it into my mouth. It was stale, soggy, and a little bit sweet, far from what I had expected. I decided to give it a second chance and put the second one in my mouth. It was even worse. It was rotten and had a terrible bitter taste. I quickly spit it out and realized I made a big mistake.<br /><br />I was going to give this product only one star. But realizing I had a very high expectation which may affect my objectivity, I'm giving it two stars in the spirit of being fair. In any case, I do NOT recommend this product. There're far better products out there, like the one sold in Costco.","High expectations, then it comes eating it...",2
"As a big fan of the old Cool Brew Blueberry Ice, I bought this because the other had been discontinued.  I thought this may have just be a ""repackaging"" (40 instead of 48 tea bags) and would taste the same.  I was very disappointed because this pale green tea had very little blueberry taste.  In fact, there was very little taste at all.  Since I have six boxes, I am experimenting with ways to make it palatable.  I'm adding a couple of bags of other teas (Blueberry Breeze) when I make it, to add a hint of flavor. I wouldn't recommend as a blueberry tea.  Guess it is a good alternative to water.  Hope Celestial Seasonings brings back the old version.",Ho Hum Brew,2
"Although I am a big tea drinker, both hot and cold, I don't normally drink green tea as I enjoy a nice black tea taste and have never bought it as a beverage. Therefore I didn't really know what to expect when I got the Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea - Passion Fruit flavor. However, I was pleasantly surprised - the green tea taste is mild and there is a really nice passion fruit flavor.<br /><br />Now for the big ""BUT"". The Amazon page says that the bottle contains ""real Aloe Vera pulp"" which I also assume is infused with passion fruit since if you chew it that's what the taste is. However, I've seen Aloe Vera and it's a succulant and the pulp that's in the bottle looks similar to orange pulp, so maybe its passion fruit - the label doesn't say anything more helpful. There isn't alot of it in the bottle, but the color of the drink combined with the pulp gives the strong impression that something inside went bad (or worse - it gives the impression of looking at pond water with floating bugs and stuff).  Maybe that's why the label is opaque, wraps around the entire bottle, and goes from the base all the way to the neck - the marketers have figured out the public doesn't want to see all that stuff floating around in their drinks.<br /><br />So the drink is actually quite good - I'd probably buy it again just for the taste - but I don't really like anything hard in my drink (which is why I don't but pulpy orange juice) and thus the pulp in the drink is just a little too much to take.","Tasty But Aloe Vero ""Floaties"" Put Me Off",2

"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats",**********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2

"When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!",The cats weren't impressed!,2

The Lipton Lemon Ginseng tea has 1.7 grams of tea, and the Orange passion fruit & Jasmine has 2.0 grams of tea! Why on earth has Lipton shortchanged the amount of tea in the Red Goji Tea?

"I bought these noodle bowls based on other reviews and my (limited) previous experience with the brand.  As a quick, portable lunch these are good, although the noodle bowls are slightly less easy to deal with because you have to drain the noodles, and in doing so you lose some of the dried bits of the topping mix.  The soup bowls are great in that you keep the cooking liquid, which makes for fewer messes.  The soup bowls tend to be lower in calories, as well.<br /><br />That said, the first time I tasted one of these bowls I was disgusted.  With zero additions, the sauce is sweet, syrupy, and hugely reminiscent of soy sauce.  The next time I doctored it with a lot of sriracha sauce and it was better, but only slightly.  Still not edible.<br /><br />Today I tried something different that actually made it pleasant to eat.  I added about one-and-a-half tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter and a cup of leftover sauteed zucchini and onions.  The zucchini and onions add heft to the bowl, needed when the whole thing is just a big mess of sticky noodles.  The peanut butter took a while to stir into the sauce, but removed the overly sweet, syrupy taste.  I can even tell that there actually IS a bit of a spice kick to the sauce now.<br /><br />Of course, all that doctoring makes it much less simple to prepare, so I won't be buying this one again.  It's easier and cheaper for me to just make a batch of noodles and vegetables in peanut sauce and portion it into lunch-sized servings.",Need a LOT of doctoring,2

"I've tried many different green teas as iced tea in an electric brewer, all with good results.

I ended up pouring out the pitcher and trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the bag. Based on an earlier review, I'll probably buy an infuser and try using this for hot tea at a lower temperature. Unfortunately, I can't control the temperature of my brewing machine, so if you're doing the same this tea may not be the best choice.",I wanted to like this,2

I've been looking for a nice granola to use everyday with my yogurt.<br />Hoping that the Red Mill would be chewy but it is definitely not - it's quite bland and has a cardboard like texture.<br />I definitely wouldn't recommend this if you plan on using it to add a kick to your morning yogurt.<br />Maybe it's best to get something with a little fat - but I've had non-fat granola that is much tastier than this red mill.<br />The one redeeming quality of this product is that you do get quite a lot for your money - unfortunately I ended up giving it to friends because I wasn't a fan.,Bland!,2
"I have a Fox/JRT/who-knows-what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the ""spin"" and ""flip"" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a ""cheater"", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a ""project in the works"", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!","Nice, basic addition to the collection...",2

"Essentia water tastes great, and its price is in the same ball park as other good quality bottled water. However, stating that the 9.5 pH is good for you is completely devoid of any scientific substance. In fact, there are a lot of scientific studies that completely refute these claims. There's a page by a retired chemistry professor, who rips into the variety of similar ""alkalanized"" and ""ionized"" water marketing claims. Most importantly, his page contains a lot of links to University and other scientific research results that all undermine the important of the 9.5 pH. Having said all that, I do like the taste of Essentia water, so whatever minerals it has in it does make for great tasting, pleasant to drink water.

Like I read on another reviewer's summary - some of the artichoke hearts were tough and I had to discard parts of the hearts. Not the best quality I have had. What they should have done was trim them a little more so that the hard tough parts were not there - I guess they wanted to cheap it out a little and include parts that would have been thrown out if you were making them from fresh Artichokes.

"Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?

It was delivered in a timely manner. Great service. It was packaged much better than I thought. From the picture you expect to get brown paper bag full of leaves. What is actually received is a food grade, thick plastic-lined paper bag. The bag also has a zip-lock like sealer.

It hurts my throat, the spice is so heavy. I tried diluting it with both milk and water, but the pain persists.<br /><br />I failed to note any Chai seasoning in the cup I drank.

"This pretzel mix and its mixing/baking instructions leave a lot to be desired.  The mixing/baking instructions are printed so small that even with good eyesight, I needed a magnifying glass to read them.  Instructions were confusing to say the least in that it talks about pouring the yeast packet into a small bowl and adding a cup of warm water, mix well before adding to dry mix.  There was no yeast package in the box I was working with nor any of the other three boxes that I opened.  Just to confirm that the yeast had not already been added to the dry mix and the instructions had not been updated accordingly, I called the company and asked.  They informed that there should have been a seperate yeast package in each box.  They then offered to send me four packages of yeast to replace what I was obviously going to have to buy before I could make up the mixes.  To date, I've not received anything from this company albeit it has been nearly three weeks since I called them.  Thankfully, I had one package of yeast on hand so that I could continue with my immediate baking project.  There is also no salt in the mix which renders a very bland tasting pretzel notwithstanding the coarse salt sprinkled on the tops.  For those on a low to no sodium diet, this pretzel mix might be ideal for you.  As for brushing the formed pretzel with warm baking soda water after placing on the baking pan, I am convinced this procedure contributed to the burned bottoms.  Yes, the oven temp was exactly as per the baking instructions as was the bake time.  The instructions do not recommend brushing the pretzels with a small amount of lightly beaten egg white which allows the sprinkled on top coarse salt to adhere much better than just brushing with the baking soda water.  I have three more boxes of this mix to use and I intend to modify the mixing/baking instructions to match a much better made from scratch ""old world"" receipe for pretzels that calls for both a bit of salt and dunking the formed pretzels in near boiling baking soda water for 20 seconds.  Once you lift the pretzels from the water with a slotted spatula or similar utensil, the baking soda water drips from the pretzel.  I've never had burned pretzel bottoms using this method.  The oven temp and bake time will also be adjusted.  Was just trying to find a mix that could reduce the number of ingredients needed to be kept on hand for the ""old world"" receipe as well as to alleviate some of the mixing since my hands are becoming very arthritic.

"I was really excited to try these cookies because I really love Oreos.  After reading rave reviews, I went out and got a package of them from Whole Foods.  Maybe it's the fact that I have just recently been diagnosed as Celiac (1 month ago) and the amazing taste of real Oreos is fresh in my mind, but these just don't do it for me.  They taste nothing like real Oreos and probably have more in common with a Hydrox cookie.

"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.

This stuff is delicious, melon is my favourite, and these sodas aren't as sweet and full of unnecessary ingredients as American sodas are. Just five ingredients: carbonated water, sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, citric acid, and the artificial flavour of the product you're buying. That's it!

Once brewed, there was a flavor which I cannot describe, but which I did not like, followed by a very subtle lemony aftertaste.

Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin).

"I wanted to like these, as sweet potato chips are a fine alternative to the usual run-of-the-mill offerings you find parked in a bowl at gatherings. Problem is, the quality is so poor that I couldn't even enjoy their flavor.<br /><br />First issue is the shape consistency. I see I'm not the only reviewer here of that opinion, and of course he was flamed in the comments section for being an ignorant Philistine who couldn't grasp the concept of ""natural"". I beg to differ. You don't need to be a card carrying member of the P.E.T.A.-Vegan-Holistic Medicine-Sleeping Under Pyramids brigade to know lousy QC when you see it. And by ""it"", I mean there may be 3 actual chips in the bag that resemble a cross-section of a sweet tuber. The rest look something like the evil spawn of a Frito and a Cheese Doodle. Pretty impossible to attempt any sort of dipping with these if you don't want all your guests sharing each other's DNA from their fingers. Makes one wonder if they're using a washing machine to do their ""kettle"" cooking as these specimens look like they went to war during the  processing phase.<br /><br />The other, and more egregious issue is the reason for the review title. There's 5oz. in the bag, but about 2 actual servings. Why, you ask? Oil. The actual amount of the product itself equals about half of a 7oz. bag of Trader Joe's Crinkle Cut Sweet Potato Chips (which btw, look like the real deal we've all grown to love and got fat from). These things are so saturated you'll find shiny ones glistening with so much oil that they remind me of my own attempts at making these at home. You'd think there would be some sort of drying-leaching of oil phase in the assembly line before they landed in the bag. And forget doing the crumb-dump when you get to the end; all the little pieces are stuck to the inside of the slimy bag. Kinda like when your at the movies and you get to the bottom of the popcorn bag you regret asking for extra butter-like-substance.<br /><br />I've been through 4 bags of a case, and they're all identical in quality, so unless they had a bad day at the factory when they made up my order, I can only come to the conclusion that others who seem to like these either have lower standards, or they've never had other brands to compare to.<br /><br />Sorry for the long rant, but that was my experience with this product and I felt it was my duty to be helpful to others who might be interested in these. I'll be cancelling my auto-order for these, and go back to TJ's for their superior chips; more of 'em, and cheaper too!","Hmm, Good Health....not so much.",2

With shipping, the 4 oz can was over $21. It contained quite a bit of liquid. The crab meat tasted well. However, it was predominantly of the small-fiber consistency, hardly any real great lump meat.

It used to be made with 100% Valencia peanuts, with skins left on, but the company now uses Virginia peanuts.  The peanut butter is not nearly as tasty and is now an incredibly thin, oily consistency.

"LONG STORY SHORT: These cost too much, are not good for dipping, and suffer from the tiniest bit of humidity. Do not buy.<br /><br />THE WHOLE STORY:<br /><br />I was so excited when I saw these Rothchild Pretzel Dippers for sale. I was having a little get together with the swanky ladies down the block and I wanted to be certain that what I had to offer for our Book Club snack items were up to snuff. I ordered some Rothchild Red Pepper Dip <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045DO9QY"">Red Pepper Dip</a>and got out my Mother's antique China snack plates and was all set to go. I even had matching crystal pieces, one for the Pretzels and a smaller one for the Red Pepper Dip. As suits the snooty lady image, our book of the month was SOUL BY SOUL: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674005392"">Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market</a>.<br /><br />Now, I am neither particularly swanky, snooty, nor snobby. I had moved into a new neighborhood and wanted to make a decent impression on the nice ladies that invited me to join their book club. I wore my Blue Jeans, a top with some ""hip"" sequins and my blue sandals. That's it. It's me, just me, and I will try to give you some good food, be polite, and see if we can all have a good time.<br /><br />So, I had various snack type foods available, a bit of wine, some Iced Tea with Peaches, a little Perrier for looks and off we went. It is a good thing the other ladies were QUITE POLITE because the Pretzel Dippers were a flop. They looked and tasted pretty much like the square Snyder's Pretzels that can be purchased at the local cut rate grocery store: a. The square snaps:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3K8"">Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Snaps, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> or b.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XOYSTE"">Snyder's of Hanover - Old Fashioned Dipping Stix Pretzels - 10-oz. Bag (Pack of 3)</a>. Actually, Snyder's dipping pretzels are the stick kind while Rothchild's resemble Snyder's little square ones with square holes in them.<br /><br />DRIPPERS INSTEAD OF DIPPERS: So, you can figure out right away, that Rothchild's Dipping Pretzels with holes allow all but the sturdiest of dip to drip or squish through the holes. My Snyders Red Pepper Dip had enough substance to it that the peppers DID stay on the pretzel, but the liquid that was associated with the Pepper Dip dripped right through. Good we had Mom's china to catch the drips. Paper plates would have inevitable become soggy. Thankfully, I had also made a Cream Cheese Based Dip and it DID stay on the Pretzels without any dripping. But, exactly what was the point? Making a sweet cream cheese dips that ends up being tried on Pretzels, instead of the intended bagel chips, was kind of a waste. So, I did not like these dippers because they would have been more appropriately labeled DRIPPERS.<br /><br />TASTE: The Rothchild taste was very Plain. Snyder's Pretzel taste, in my opinion, is much superior. I thought for the price that Rothschild might have thrown in a secret taste ingredient that made them worth the price. That was not so. Basically, they tasted like your usual prtzel with a little less salt.<br /><br />SOGGINESS: DID THEY STAND THE TEST OF TIME: I live in Arizona where the humidity is almost nil. Snyders Pretzels, The regular Rold Golds, and even those tubs of pretzels that the boss buys and sets out in the office hold up and stay fresh for 2 or 3 months with no problem. Not Rothschid Dippers. By day 5 after the party, these Rothchild Pretzels were starting to give, bend, and show signs of initial sogginess.<br /><br />MY SUGGESTION: Skip the Pricey Rothchild Pretzels. If it has to be Pretzels, you may as well go with the regular old Rold Golds. But, my real and truest suggestion, if dip is coming into play, Use Tostitos Scoops tortillia Chips. They are built for dipping and scooping and the nice ladies won't think you wasted your money on some high priced doo dad that is mostly for looks. Instead, they will think you are a smart, frugal little gal who fits right in with the crowd.  On the other hand, if you want it to look like you spent a bundle on a snack food with no redemptive taste, use as a dipper, or an item that makes it price worth the money, go ahead, buy the Rothchilds. I found them to be tasteless and a total waste of money. No recommendation from me!",I WOULD USE Rold Gold or Tostitos Scoops Instead,2
"After finding out that what we THOUGHT were the best brands (Science Diet, Iams) were chock-full of fillers and by-products, we decided to upgrade our kitty's diet.  After doing some research, we decided to give several brands a try, and this was the first.  Despite quality ingredients, Caesar would not touch this stuff!  Even when mixing it in with a brand that he liked, he completely avoided the bowl altogether.  Talking to several clerks and cat owners, Wellness has a high rejection rate among cats.  Some love it, but many just turn their nose up at it.<br />I'd normally give it one star, but the quality of ingredients in here is quite good, so that earns it an extra star.  But what good are quality ingredients if they never leave the bowl?","It's a quality product, but...",2

"I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)",Maybe just not for my dog?,2
"I allowed myself to be convinced by some of the glowing reviews of this coffee, but now regret it. The argument about the oil being inside the beans rather than oozing from the surface is wrong - the oil is long gone. These are some nasty little dried out brown beans. They produce an espresso (made with an old Pavoni with the traditional slot-machine arm) that is on the lower end of what I find acceptable, and they are probably unsuitable for any other method. Right now, for instance, I have a cup made with a French press, and it has very little deep coffee flavor, but instead a bitterness that sets my teeth on edge and a burnt toast aftertaste that is lasting way past its welcome (I used less than one measure of beans and water at 195 degrees F). I think the review objecting to black beans is just wrong - I have had any number of black roasted, oily beans that make better espresso while also lending themselves to other methods with good results. Among the bulk brands available on Amazon, I would prefer the Coffee Beans Direct Italian Roast Espresso to these beans, and the price is also better. Neither of them come close to Peet's, but that's another price point altogether.","Bitter, bitter, bitter",2

I tried Madagascar vanilla red by Celestial which also contains Rooibos. So I thought I'd give this a try due to the great reviews.

After trying both teas hands down Madagascar Vanilla Red is way tastier!,Way too sweet and concentrated!,2
"Reason for Smiling after eating this cereal is that you are on a sugar high! It contains brown sugar, evaporated cane juice and honey, but wait even the crisp rice contains sugar.

I bought this product once before and took for about a week. I did not notice it helping with sleep. I continued to wake every night. I also don't notice that it calms me down.

"Did I get a bad batch?  People here seemed to rate it so highly?  Very bland taste for me.  Strangely enough, whatever aroma is there almost more of chamomile or peppermint than actual tea.

"To give a bit of credit the side of the bag explains that the coffee is a dark roast flavored with burnt sugar, licorice root, orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg - not quite the delicious buttery caramel that they picture on the front. I feel it's deceiving though - the coffee looks unusually dark, has a strange chemical smell [perhaps from the licorice, but I love licorice and this smells like a solvent] and a noticeably bad aftertaste. Even with extra cream. For the eight bucks I paid in-store I'd rather have bought some Folgers and a bag of Werthers caramels to mix in - would have been a better value.","Strange Color, Smells Weird, Bad Aftertaste",2

One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.

"These Colombian coffee beans used to be a good everyday/nothing fancy coffee.  I've bought them 2 times in the last 6 months (& many times in the past years); they are not as good as they used to be.  They claim the beans are the same even though the packaging changed but I don't believe it.  The beans are now more bitter & have less flavor.  I also found more quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is ""acceptable"" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.

"Let me first say that I am a foodie.  I smoke my own ribs, chicken, etc and when I make brisket it smokes slow and low for at least 14 hours.  I have fresh herbs in my kitchen all year and I like to cook foods with robust flavor in styles from around the word.  I am an avid reader of Cook's Illustrated, Saveur, Bon Appetit, etc.<br /><br />While an interesting novelty, this seasoning takes more like a standard smoke flavored BBQ seasoning than actual bacon in my opinion.  What is worse is that all the flavors but the natural one contain MSG.  MSG is something I try to avoid if at all possible because isn't healthy and often gives me headaches.  The natural version of this seasoning has less flavor than the rest unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, as that is the only one I'm willing to use.  If you love the taste of bacon I would recommend doing what professional chefs have done for years: reserve your bacon fat after cooking it and add a little as seasoning when you want the REAL taste of bacon.","Not too bad, if you like MSG",2

"So let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of anything with marshmallows and/or mallow product of any kind. My boyfriend and I saw these and thought they sounded delicious, and they turned out to be a huge disappointment. The quality of the chocolate is terrible, I'm talking ""Russel Stover"" terrible: grainy, chalky, and hard. The ""mallo"" filling isn't too bad, but there isn't much of it, and the coconut is essentially non-existent. What you basically end up with is a mouth full of grainy, terrible chocolate flavor with sweet milky aftertaste from the wannabe marshmallow filling.<br /><br />If these things were more like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups with filling similar to the marshmallow in either Rocky Road candy bars or Hagen Dazz Rocky Road ice cream they would be awesome. And they should either have more coconut or none at all, because right now it only adds to the grainy texture without adding any flavor.<br /><br />Anyway, I seriously regret buying these- ESPECIALLY SINCE I LATER FOUND HUGE PACKS OF THEM AT THE DOLLAR TREE! -_-",Very low quality- and I'm not hard to please,2

(It looks like something from another planet, honestly.) You can see the fish, so I was optimistic. She ate some of the gooey gelatin stuff, sniffed the fish, and started meowing (meaning, please don't let me eat this.) I left it out thinking she would maybe nibble on it more when I wasn't looking, and needless to say, a few hours later, it was still there, only it had dried up significantly.

It was so chewy it stuck to my teeth. Recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but I tried it at 10 minutes and it was uneatable. It was best at 12 minutes - cooked over full flame in a full rolling boil in plenty of water. Be sure to use lots of water. Unlike regular pasta, when cooking pasta made from rice or other flours you can't really get away with crowding the pot.<br /><br />> They claim it has a true pasta-like texture. As an Italian-American from NY who has been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years, this isn't like any pasta I've tried before, home made or store bought, and I don't think it has ""true pasta-like"" texture as they claim. Like I said above, sticky, chewy, tacky.<br /><br />> It felt like wet cement in my stomach. I'm not exaggerating. It made me painfully constipated.<br /><br />> Since it is not made from whole grain brown rice, it's white, I feel it's not really that healthy for you. It's not advertised as whole grain or brown rice so I wouldn't take away stars due to this. I just don't think people should eat white rice or products made out of white rice if they can get whole grain brown rice instead.<br /><br />> It's made from rice, potato, and soy. The Potato is white, just like the rice. And soy, well more and more we're finding out too much soy in the diet is not good for you. For centuries soy was mainly used as a seasoning, it's only in modern times food manufacturer's are trying to shove it down our throats in any form they can. I feel the combination of white rice, white starchy potato and questionable soy is just too much for me to recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But as I've mentioned in some other reviews, poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it.

"May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought!

"Hooked up this electric fence around my garbage cans that something keeps knocking over.  Figured an electrified, bare 120v AC wire would do the job quicker, but I didn't want a bunch of charred critters laying outside.  Using this electric fence, I am absolutely certain that I won't have any charred critters around...even if they took a nap on the wire.<br /><br />The system is pretty easy to setup; it would have been nicer if it would have came with a bit more rebar for each of the plastic fence posts, as they're kind of flimsy and you're just supposed to bury them a couple inches deep.  It's really not very secure to begin with.  Alas I hooked the thing up in a big box around 2 trash cans and a recycle bin.  Nice tight, tense wire was almost invisible unless you were looking for it, and hooked up to the power box, which was hooked up to the ground...plugged it in, and the light started flashing.  BINGO!  Next time something comes to knock over a trash can, *ZAP!*<br /><br />Not so much.<br /><br />Like any man would, I figured I should test it out.  I didn't feel a thing.  Absolutely nothing.  I could have snorted half the wire up my nose and hacked it out of my mouth and not been any worse for the wear.  I checked to make sure nothing was touching to short/ground out - everything was tense, straight, the ground was hooked up correctly...and...maybe I just have remarkably thick skin, I thought to myself.<br /><br />I went to bed able to see the obnoxious flashing light telling me that my trash can was protected.  I woke up to a knocked over trash can, with one of the bags dragged over the wires, bending it quite a bit, and leaving the wires resting nicely on the cold, moist ground.<br /><br />And now the thing never flashes.<br /><br />It certainly didn't work for me.  Re-stringing the wire doesn't work, the fuses aren't burned out, all the connections are fine, it just doesn't work.  If it DID work, I think it'd be a pretty nice little fence based on the easy of installation and price.  Wouldn't recommend...unless wherever you buy it has a generous return policy, just in case.",Benefit of the doubt is the only way this gets 2 stars.,2

"I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other ""b-list"" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the ""kick"" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula.

They are however fairly heavy and not so cost efficient, so we decided to buy the singles.<br /><br />Unfortunately the idea of the singles are better than the actual use. Size and price is good, but the powder does not dissolve easily. You either have to shake very hard, or shake gently for a very long time to dissolve the powder. So if you have a hungry infant, your choice is to have the baby scream because of hunger whilst preparing the formula, or risk an upset stomach later as the heavy shaking traps airbubbles in the formula. Naturally you could prepare the formula prior to the time of feeding, but in a way that defeats the purpose of the singles. The formula must also be used within a certain period of time, so your infant needs to be pretty regular in terms of feedingtimes.<br /><br />All in all, I think it deserves a some positive feedback on the quality of the formula and the convenient packaging, but unfortunately the cons outweighs the pros on this particular product.",Ready to feed --- after 30 min....,2

"First off the noodles get very broken up from the packaging (probably the shipping and handling), so you wind up with nearly a quarter of a bag at the bottom in small pieces, the other problem is that they just do not have much flavor and they do not offer a great texture to the meal.  I tried to make these with some teriyaki and chicken stock, and they came out mushy and flavorless, they do not seem to absorb and flavor from the dish and they get soggy like and do not hold up after cooking.  I frequently enjoy making noodle dishes and have never had noodles that came out so bland and textureless as these did, even when cooked with intense flavor items.  I much prefer Maifun Rice Sticks, and will probably stick to them for future entrees.<br /><br />Maybe in certain dishes you can make use of these noodles, but for the meals that I like, I will have to continue to use Rice Sticks and Chinese Noodles.  My only other flaw with these noodles is that they get crushed in their packaging, and causes for the majority of the noodles to be broken at the bottom of the bag.",Have had better,2

"First I want to say that this company has fabulous customer service!  My item was originally lost/delayed in the mail due to no fault of the seller's.  They were quick to respond to my concern, and sent another item to ensure that the sprinkles would make it in time for my daughter's birthday.  But here is my concern (and it is a big one!) - the sprinkles came in an unsealed, unlabeled jar that just had a slip of paper with the ingredients hastily scotch taped to the bottle.  I now see that this was also the case with another reviewer's item.  I will not be willing to use these sprinkles - even though they are exactly what I was expecting and wanted - because I have no idea where they came from or who has had contact with them!  I am not willing to give these to a group of toddlers and their parents.  So basically I paid for something that I will not be using.  And if I attempt to return them to the seller, will they just resell them to another person without knowing if I could have opened the item and touched them?  This is just nasty.

I saw what was printed on the box, ""blackberry pomegranate flavor with other natural flavor, no aspartame"".  Hey, that sounds good, but further box reading shows it contains sucralose, here is one comment I found about sucralose:  According to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that ""although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural.""

"I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I"">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.

At first, the order arrived and all of the bags were just crushed to pieces.  I called Amazon and they were GREAT and sent me a replacement; however, the second batch wasn't much better which made me think it was the composition of the pears that crumbles during shipment.  The taste is too sweet, which is surprising since there is nothing in there except pears!  I prefer the apples in this line, and if you are looking for a great snack this is perfect.  I love to give them to my toddler (one bag = one apple!) as a snack when we are on the go.  And my fifth grader loves them in her lunch - they are what the ""cool"" kids have as they are a bit pricy (but come on what would you rather spend $1.25 on...organic apples or some high fructose junk which you know you'll end up buying in those little packs that cost twice as much per oz.!)<br /><br />So bottom line - love the crispy apples, pass on the pears unless they revamp the recipe and get a new pear variety.",Too sweet and packaging flaws,2

"You look at the box and you think -- a way to sneak in more veggies that no one will notice.

Now a non-veggie pasta from Kraft Mac & Cheese has three servings, this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people.  It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us, it was basically adding no vegetable value at all.<br /><br />The taste was basically tasteless. We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly.  It was salty but not cheesy.  The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so bland.<br /><br />I could take a nice tomato and/or spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier.

I bought the kit to dabble in spherification. The item is as-described and arrived on time. My complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams. My kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams. I cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams. Therefore I find the kit difficult to use. I would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams.,As described but difficult to use,2
A box of this coffee contains 15 packets. There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted. It would take all 15 packets to make  one 8 cup pot of weak coffee at a cost of over ten bucks. Not a good choice. There are far better coffees available at far more reasonable prices.

Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was disappointed. I would like to see if they make it in a bean I can grind fresh so I can see if that makes a difference.<br />I will say that I took some of the ground coffee to a friends and she made it and said she liked it.

"I'm always on the lookout for a great no-sugar sweetener, I currently like and use Ideal for white sugar substitution. I've been hearing some buzz about this 'new sweetener'. I saw Splenda on the label, and in general I'm not a real Splenda fan only because I can taste it in almost anything. But, it's a new product, why not try it? So I ordered it on Vine when I saw it was available. For the record, there is no sucralose (Splenda) in this at all.<br /><br />If I had seen this product on the shelf at the store, I would not have purchased it after picking it up and reading the label, and that is because:<br /><br />**The second ingredient is sugar. &lt;-- Yes you just read that correctly: sugar.

Sure, legally if it's below a certain threshold they can count it as zero on the label. BUT WHY WOULD ***YOU*** pretend there is no caloric impact, even if they will??<br /><br />The whole ""all natural! No Calorie sweetener"" is misleading and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I did try this in some coffee and it had a too-sweet edge, but I did use the amount I normally use of non-sugar products.

"Unless you are already feeding your dog a low end dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is not something I'd recommend feeding to your pet.<br /><br />I try to feed our dog better grade dog food.  Right now he is eating Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix.  There are several other high quality pet foods available.<br /><br />If you'd rather skip this review and are looking for a better quality dog food, there are several out there, some of which strive to serve ""natural/organic"" products.  Here are justa few, listed alphabetically:  Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, Merrick (who recently merged with Castor and Pollux), and Wellness.<br /><br />Chef Michael's is a Purina product.  While not trying to malign Purina, I am not aware of any better quality dog foods they produce.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order, directly from the label:<br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. C-5900.<br /><br />Nothing against beef for my dog, so it doesn't start out bad.  But after that....soybean meal and soy flour are just ""protein fillers"".  The next largest ingredient is animal fat.  Animal fat can come from numerous sources, including rodents, diseased animals, and you really just don't know the source.  After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is ""chewy"" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a ""candy"" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all.",Low Quality Dog Food,2

"When this product became a ""Helper Complete Meal"" instead of just a regular ""Complete Meal"", they reformulated the topping, which used to be a breadcrumb-based parmesan-cheese blend. The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor is very mild, not ""Alfredo"" at all, but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good. The overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese. It is, however, a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 (or maybe 2 adults + 1 child).<br /><br />What is there is indeed easy to make, and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box. If you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe, then this is OK. However, if you're looking for a high-quality meal, look elsewhere.

"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.",Too Much Sugar!,2
"I bought this along with several other Roland tinned teas.  This was at the bottom of the heap in terms of taste. There is a faint, and I mean faint taste of cloves with this tea.

So when I saw these individaul packages I just assumed they taste the same as a full size box and these do not.  I called Nabisco to complain and was told that each manufacuturing plant is processes differently sometimes as the equipment differs. I use to love these graham crakers but not anymore.  These were burnt on oneside, cracked and do not have that rich taste that they use to.

At least that's what I thought.<br />WRONG!!!  :(<br />As I said above, I really enjoyed the yellow one (which was the last one I ate, thankfully)- The other three though?  Not so much.<br />I literally have NO IDEA what the flavors of ANY of them were...  Once the package arrived, there was no guide, no clue, no nothing.<br />Gotta admit, that was kinda surprising, considering these are hardly a ""cheap"" dessert, if you catch my drift, especially since so much effort had been placed upon packaging as well.<br />And then, the fact that one of them arrived crushed was quite disappointing...<br />Especially since it was pretty obvious that it was due to mishandling before shipment, considering the box was lined with peanuts for added protection, with no dents or damage visible to the cardboard packaging, or the inside box.<br /><br />Ultimately, disappointing.<br />I really wish your next customer has a good experience.",Sigh...,2

"We have a 5 year old mixed breed dog who weighs about 85 pounds on good days.  Frankly, she has had a rough time of it.  She caught the very tail end of the dog food crisis, ended up with kidney problems that rear their ugly heads now and then, and has become the world's pickiest dog food eater.  Chances are good that if she will eat any given dog food, it is a 50-50 proposition as to whether or not her kidneys will act up.  As a result, Miss Ted's people have tried any number of dog foods - the cheap stuff, the expensive stuff, the special diet stuff, the stuff from Walmart, the stuff from the grocery store, the stuff from the pet store, the stuff from the vet, even the refrigerated stuff, so I was happy to be given a chance to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>.<br /><br />The bag arrived beautifully packaged and unlike his normal habit of simply leaving things on the porch, the UPS driver carried this all the way upstairs for  me.  (I  was very grateful.) Miss Ted happened to be in one of her ""that stuff is poison and I'm not going to touch it so I'll just eat the cat's food until I can get into the pantry for some real people food"" mood, so her bowl remained untouched.  We tried another half-dozen times over a period of 10 days or so and got the same reaction every time. The dog food looks fine and smells fine, but Miss Ted won't eat Beneful - even if she hasn't eaten anything but the cat food in a couple of days.<br /><br />Others have pointed out some of the controversy surrounding this particular dog food, as well as the low rating given to the product by the Dog Food Advisor due to the high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02:  if you are feeding strays like Grandma did out West, then this might be a good option and having the dog food delivered is a fantastic service.  On the other hand, if you have a ""special needs"" dog, the is probably not the best option.<br /><br />Your call.",Miss Ted Wouldn't Touch It!,2

I was expecting this coffee to have a stronger vanilla taste - to taste more like a French Vanilla cappuccino.  I could barely taste the vanilla.  I added a little white chocolate syrup and it helped bring out the vanilla flavor a little more.  If you want a definite vanilla flavor I would suggest passing on this one.

All of them have this artificial sweetness that can't be overriden by the different varieties.

The other varieties don't change that.<br /><br />Second, the ingredients -<br /><br />This is the listed ingredient list.  I have a sensitivity to sugar alcohol (zylitor, splenda (sucralose), etc) so I use stevia in my coffee.  No problem.  With this drink, I started having gastrointestinal issues common to sugar alcohols.  I didn't know what was causing it so I changed some things in my diet to no avail.  Then I looked at this ingredient list.  Stevia is NOT the primary sweetener.  Ingredients are listed by the most prevalent first - erythritol is a sugar alcohol.  It's the same chemical family as splenda.  Um.. no thanks.  I wanted a NATURALLY sweetened drink - not another chemical one.<br /><br />I feel this company is being dishonest in its product.

Granted, it takes 2 Senseo pods to make a good full cup but at least I can make a good full cup without having to guess when to turn the cycle off. I find it puzzling that these guys wouldn't just make their pods in the right size for either a half cup or full cup the way a Senseo was designed.<br /><br />There may be other pod machines out there where these pods work well, but that is not a Senseo.",Does not fit a Senseo Very Well at All,2

Although I already have him on a high protein, low carb diet, I think the even higher level of protein in this food might be too much for his digestive tract to handle.

"I read all the reviews and was excited to get the coffee but after brewing my first few cups I must say this is not great coffee.  I love Peet's Major Dickason's and other more flavorfull well roasted coffee but the MM comes off heavy with charcoal, cardboard and a chunk of bitter without good aromatics or a complex pallate of flavors I enjoy in richer coffee.  I now have 46 more K-cups to work through.  Before you take the plunge and get a heap of the MM I highly reccomend a sampler pack, it may not be your favorite cup either.",Read the reviews but disappointing,2

"If you enjoy making cappuccino's with your Dolce Gusto, I would suggest just buying the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA"">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Espresso, 16-Servings (Pack of 3)</a> and heating/frothing your own milk. The milk pod just didn't have a nice flavor in my opinion. Perhaps my pod was heat damaged, but it tasted sour. Unfortunately, I had to dump it down the sink because it really was that terrible and couldn't be saved.<br /><br />Since Nescafe states that the dark pod is espresso, I would be confident ordering a box of the espresso pods and frothing 1% milk with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G9N94E"">BonJour Primo Latte Frother, Rechargeable Includes Electric Base</a>.

"I bought a case of Merrick Surf & Turf with high hopes for my clutter of nine cats.  Alas, the hype didn't live up to the reality.  The product is essentially a wasted purchase, as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff.  I'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry.<br /><br />The ingredient list drew me to the product, being grain-free, and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood, plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler.  Upon opening the can, it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high, with little seafood scent detectable.  It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.  Have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff, and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them.<br /><br />I realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything, but when none of my nine will touch the stuff, I can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi-finicky cat, as a number of my gang will eat most anything, and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye-popping.  If you're cat is very picky, but you know s/he likes beef, then this flavor will probably appeal to him/her, but otherwise, I wouldn't spend your hard-earned moolah on this stuff.  Save your money and your frustration.<br /><br />I give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list; I'd otherwise give it only one star.","Great ingredient list, poor real-life performance with my taste-test panel",2
"My main issue with this product is that i received the old formula with the old label. I wanted to try fast twitch because it was apparently caffeine free. That may be the case with the new formula but not the one i received. I have used it two times now and the product is a good pre workout supplement offering a good pump and good energy boost, however, it is not my favorite. Besides the caffeine that wasn't supposed to be in it, my second issue is the taste. It's a very potent pre workout compared to a Superpump Max by Gaspari that tastes more like a juice. Fast twitch is just very strong. I'm not totally sure if i did not mix it into enough water. Bottom line is that for the price it is worth it to try it out because you may see better results.",Not what it says,2

We also find Starbucks has a  weird aftertaste like the beans are over roasted, possibly the same problem here??  So far made 3 cups and 2 stars is all we can give.

"For some reason I love this chalky, vaguely fruity flavored confection. I've been waiting all year for Valentines day so I can go out of control and eat these things for no apparent reason. I purchased six of this exact product in this exact size (7oz) and label: five from one supermarket and one from another. The candy seems stale. The purple ones are rock hard and I'm afrade I'll break a tooth so I throw those away, and the green ones are almost as bad so I've given up on them. That leaves the yellow, pink, orange (usually) and blue ones as safe to eat. These aren't supposed to be hard candy, are they?<br /><br />The Necco web site says these hearts are produced all year for sale during the Valentines holiday period. They are supposed to be soft candy. So it seems that you may get a bag from eleven months ago or a couple weeks ago. Good luck! I think I got the from spring 2011.<br /><br />By the way, I got my 7 oz bags for only a fraction of the coin demanded here, so best to look at the grocery store in the seasonal items area first.<br /><br />Also, I bought a bag of the Brach's Conversation Hearts and did a comparison. The Brach's product seemed fresh with no rock hard hearts, but the flaver is a bit more bland. It's difficult to tell if the different color Brach's hearts are meant to be different flavors. They're more like just fresh sweet chalk.","Hard hearted candy manufactured all year, sold now.",2

"I bought this from a brick and mortar baby supply chain, and I was so excited to use it! I peeled, I chopped, I steamed and pureed. I was so happy! Then I realized it took me all day to make one regular sized batch of baby food. Still, it was so easy to just throw it in and walk away, so I kept making my baby food, one tiny batch at a time. Then, the fourth time I tried to use it, it would not steam. The start, stop, and steam buttons do not work. I'd had the machine less than a month. Then I noticed (as I was dumping out my unused water) that there was a bunch of metallic looking crap floating around in the water chamber.

My usual whole grain pasta actually has 75% more protein and 50% more fiber than this quinoa pasta. So really I regret buying it.

"Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former ""Fresh Mixers"" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to ""Lunch Express,"" apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.","""Fresh Mixers"" to ""Lunch Express"" Not Good For Consumers",3

"My cocker spaniel enjoyed these treats. They do not contain corn or wheat, which is good because he seems to get itchy when he eats those grains.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not give them to our other dog, a beagle mix. He tends to get seizures after he consumes chicken, and since these contain natural chicken flavor, I did not risk giving him these.<br /><br />I received these treats as a sample. I would not bother to purchase them because of the cost plus the fact that only one of my pets can eat them.<br /><br />I wonder if the price would be lower if designer nutrients were left out. I mean, do dogs naturally want green tea extract? I realize that studies are being done on possible benefits of this substance, but throwing some in dog treats is not the same as having a vet prescribe it. When I searched the web for research on canine green tea extract, one of the first that came up reported that some beagles died in a study using high doses of the extract, so now I feel that caution may be advisable. Of course, your dog would have to eat an awful lot of these treats to get enough of it to suffer any harm; a single treat is almost certainly okay.<br /><br />Nutraceuticals have become trendy because marketers know that people are aware that certain nutrients have impressive health benefits. And including these nutrients give manufacturers a reason to charge more. You may want to ask your vet's opinion before paying extra for designer treats.",Benny likes it.

"I like the concept this box is going for, but it isn't effective. The sifter does a great job with poop clumps but wet clumps just stay stuck. Even with vigorous shaking sometimes the holes stayed plugged with wet, clumped litter. And if you have a large, wet clump stuck to the side, forget about easy removal! You still need a scoop to make this box work. I stopped using the sifter pretty quick and eventually just tossed it. I do LOVE having two bottom halves.

Enter this MIO stuff, which seemed like it could fit the bill: in theory.<br /><br />I'm not a nutritionist, so I don't know how actually healthy this stuff is. My guess is that it's not healthy at all. Generally speaking, anything that tastes this sweet is not good for you.

"This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.<br /><br />The teas I bought this way are good, they get a 3 for how they were just thrown into the box though.  Couldn't they have used a smaller box and lined the bags up in a way they didn't move around?  They ended up with some tea bags fine, others almost in a little ball in the middle!<br /><br />The tea is refreshing though, not high on the mint, but it's great for a summer's day!","Tea Bags are all thrown into a box and get crushed, otherwise a good deal.",3

While I liked this flavor much better then the watermelon strawberry it is still too sweet for carbonated fruit juice.  If I did not see black cherry on the label I probably would have not been able to guess this the flavor.  This is my favorite flavor of Switch they still need to amp up the flavor to be on my short list of black cherry soda.  The 8.3 oz can is a small size but considering the sweetness it is ample.,This is a small portion.  Too sweet not enough tang for Cherry soda.,3

I like the coffee but cannot see paying the price for it but the coffee is good and doesn't have any bitter after taste to it.

"I bought these because the Altoid Ginger mints are no longer availabe in stores and you need to spend $20.00 or so and get boxes of them at Amazon.  Unfortunately, these ginger candies did not do the trick for my nausea.  They don't even taste gingery.  They do have a pleasant enough taste though.",No Ginger Taste,3
"Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all.  There, I said it.  There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on.","A noble effort, but falls short",3

"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.",Mixed feelings,3

"There isn't anything too objectionable in this, according to the ingredients list at Taco Bell's official site.  It's got eggs, wheat, and soy in it (so, if you're allergic, avoid this), along with vinegar, sugar, molasses, and both saturated and unsaturated fat, propylene glycol, and some preservatives.  One of them, Calcium Disodium EDTA, has caused some environmental concern based on what it breaks down into, but it's fairly common in food products, and if you're eating Taco Bell, I am guessing you're not all that worried about it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of creamy salad dressings, you might like this on something like a chicken taco or a southwestern salad.  I'm not a fan, and I did not like the taste of this.",Tastes like a mixture of Taco Bell's taco sauce and bottled ranch dressing,3
"This product is good a trapping the insects that land on it.  However, while it claims that the yellow color attracts the insects, that doesn't seem to be the case.  They seem just as likely to land on the plant itself as they do the traps.","Catches, doesn't attract",3
"This cereal makes a yummy start to the day, and has a hearty, filling texture. It also has a subtle flavor, far less sweet than the kid-oriented products cluttering the cereal aisle. At less than five dollars a box, it's also less expensive than the mainstream brands, which practically require a second mortgage if you want to eat breakfast. And it's made without the synthetic ingredients that make other cereals kind of disgusting if you research them at all.<br /><br />But I looked at the nutritional information, and found there was almost no nutritive value. Almost no vitamins, minerals, fiber, or, well, anything. You get more nutrition from the milk you pour over the cereal than from the cereal itself. And I'm a bit squeamish about the repeated use of the word ""natural"" on the package. That word has no legal definition. Organic? Unprocessed? Who knows? They never bother to say what they mean by ""natural.""<br /><br />I need something I can rely on to start my day. Yummy is definitely a good trait.

"Brewed my first cup this morning and was not impressed.

"When I lived out west in Los Angeles, I couldn't get enough Starbuck's French Roast coffee.  It was a dark jewel, rich, flavorful, hearty.  This was the Buccaneer of branded coffees; the supermarket brews were but a pale and quivering set of oh-how-I-wish-I-were-Starbucks imitators.  I gave a dismissive laugh at the names of Maxwell House and Folgers.<br /><br />Then I moved East.  A friend sent me an Amazon gift certificate for my birthday, and I went right to the virtual Starbucks aisle and ordered a three-pack.  Finally!  Real Coffee!<br /><br />Or so I thought.  This stuff is horrible.  I feel like someone who sees a first love at the class reunion, gobsmacked by the paunchy, greying reality of today.  Liquid ashes is one of the kinder comparisons.<br /><br />Who knows?  Maybe that same municipal water which makes pizza crust and bagels inedible in LA gives a magical spark to the Starbucks there.  Maybe I should rethink herbal teas.  Whatever, I am gravely disappointed by my Starbucks French Roast.<br /><br />Not by Amazon, I should hasten to add.

"I gave this product only three stars simply because the coffee was not quite strong enough for my taste.  My usual morning coffee consists of a stronger brew, and this particular product did not give me a strong enough coffee.  The coffee has a couple of redeeming qualities, first it is a fair trade coffee, which I really appreciate.  Secondly, the coffee comes in very convenient single serve packs, which make brewing coffee very simple and fast in the morning.  The single serve packs were also a disadvantage for the coffee because you could not adjust the brew strength of the coffee.  I found that when I made my coffee in the morning, using my normal proceedures that the coffee was not strong enough once I added the cream and sugar to the coffee.<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee was palatable, if you are a person that likes a light roast, or a light brew.

"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",Unremarkable,3

I would actually rate this product much higher except for several things.  I rate it high because my cats ALL love them (8 cats), I rate it high on ingredients because it's very difficult to find cat treats that aren't just dry food in disguise complete with corn and wheat ingredients, and lastly, I would LOVE to rate these for effectiveness in keeping the teeth clean, but I just don't know if they work worth a darn... it's too early to tell.

"I can't have caffeine, so I was anxious to try this hibiscus tea from Davidson's.  I read some of the other reviews before I made the purchase, and most of them were good, so I decided to try it.<br /><br />The other reviews mentioned that this tea was tart and fruity.  I found it very tart, but not overly fruity.  Perhaps this tea has lost some of its flavor since the bag didn't seem very air tight.<br /><br />Other reviews also mention a floral smell when brewing the tea, to me it smelled a little like compost, which was slightly off-putting.  The dry tea didn't have much of a smell either- it did smell barely of dried flowers.<br /><br />The color is nice- a deep and clear red, and the flavor is ok- but I found the sourness is more appealing to me as an iced tea drink.<br /><br />I also like to put skim milk in my tea, and I don't recommend doing that, since the acidity/sourness of the tea caused it to curdle.<br /><br />The printing on the bag seemed faded, and the other reviews mention difference in bags that the tea comes in.  This particular shipment was in the fold down bag, not the zip-lock bag, like some of their other teas.  This makes me think that they are either gradually changing over to the new bags, and I got an old bag of tea- or they are inconsistent with rotating their product.<br /><br />I look forward to trying a couple more hibiscus teas that are out there so I know more about the way that it is supposed to taste.",Thought I would give this tea a try,3

"The Ready to feed idea is great. I recently travelled with my twins on a long flight (almost 20 hrs). It was very helpful especially with two babies. But, it leaked with my regular Dr.Brown's nipples. I was kind of disappointed because it would spill all over my kids's neck. It kind of worked by holding the bottle at a certain angle sometimes.

"Note: I did not buy product from this site<br /><br />The good:<br />-product has the basic ingredients needed for kimchi seasoning.<br />-One bag will take care of one large kimchi cabbage(I can't remember the actual name but its the huge leafy green traditionally used for this).<br />-Just add water & a little chopping action<br />-after day 3, it starts to smell and taste like the real deal (I followed the direction except for the salt water bath..

"I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.","Good coffee, but no directions for use or preparation.",3

"The kits I received are not what was advertised,,,I received 7lbs DME and 1lb corn sugar as opposed to the advertised LME.  DME is lighter than LME of course, but the inclusion of corn sugar bothers me a bit.  Also received .25 lb of Crystal instead of the promise 1lb.  Just be aware that the recipe contents seem to be variable.  The character of this beer is much different than  what the advertised contents will give you.<br /><br />That said, the kit itself has potential though it's sad that I have to add more ingredients.  I'd suggest dry hopping with an extra 2 oz of Cascade.  You may also want to add a bit more in the way of specialty grains (really, a quarter pound isn't that much...).  The hop character itself is lacking a bit  although the kit only included 2 oz of northern brewer hops...) and since most of the hops are bittering hops you don't get a tremendous depth of flavor...you may want to modify the hop schedule somewhat to add an ounce at about 30 minutes instead of all the Northern Brewer at the beginning of the boil.  Better yet add an extra ounce over what the kit includes.<br /><br />Lastly, I'd also suggest using a liquid yeast like Wyeast 1056 instead of the included dry yeast.  Yes it's five bucks more but I think you end up with a cleaner tasting, better fermenting beer.<br /><br />All in all, it's an acceptable kit but much different than what is advertised.  It's almost a pound short on fermentables (and I don't consider corn sugar an acceptable substitute for malt extract...) and missing an ounce of hops.  I can't help but feel a little shortchanged here.  It's doubtful I'll be purchasing fromm this vendor again.

"I bought this tea as a recommendation from a hydro colon therapist. She said regular laxatives can be very harmful to the colon, and recommended this tea as a natural and safe way to encourage more regular bowel movements.<br /><br />When I got it, I was really pleased to see that it was indeed all natural, and it tasted fine (certainly bearable!). So as the package directs, I  drank it before going to bed. I woke up with bearable cramping a few times early in the morning (around the time they predicted movement) -- when I finally got out of bed and tried to use the bathroom I felt incredibly ill. I was sweating like you can't imagine, very very very nauseous and no real bowel movement to relieve all of these symptoms. The cramping in these moments was comparable to bad period cramps -- (for the men reading this just imagine being kicked in the balls) after all of this I threw up and went back to bed and felt better later that day.<br /><br />I should note that I've never tried laxatives before, and that I have tried suppositories, which yielded the same reaction for me (minus the cramping).<br /><br />My suggestions -- If you're going to try this tea, chase it with lots of water and a banana or something so that perhaps your bowels are more willing to move. I also wouldn't recommend trying this the night before you have to be somewhere like work. You'll be fine later that day if your reaction is anything like mine but shortly after waking up you might not be in such great shape.<br /><br />Good luck!","Easy to drink, not easy to handle!",3

I also liked that it comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid with a small hole, rather than having to try to pour it out of the larger opening.

"Having started to fall in love again with India food, my mother surprised me by purchasing this 5 pack of MTR Paneer Tikka Masala. Chicken Tikka Masala happens to be my favorite so it seemed like having it with Paneer was going to be a treat. That was not the case however. While the packages of this pre-made curry were very good, and I personally would order it again, I also found the packaging and product very misleading.<br /><br />To start, we'll go over some positives. Each package of Paneer Tikka Masala contained ample amount of gravy and paneer. In terms of flavor, the gravy was delicious and has some spice to it. It went well with both Basmati rice and Brown rice. Despite a 3 serving rating, I found each package made 2 comfortable servings that would satisfy a hungry appetite. Overall I would say the best part of the product is the gravy. It is delicious!<br /><br />However, there are some problems here that I should warn you about. The package lists this as a MILD spice but it is more like Medium/hot spice. I enjoy spicy food so this didn't bother me, but in my book this clearly isn't even close to MILD spice. While the gravy portion is absolutely DELICIOUS, the Paneer is sub-par at best. It tasted fairly flavorless and was chewy, no where even close to restaurant quality, in fact they tasted almost like heavily processed flavorless-cheese. Another problem I have is well, where is the ""Tikka?"". Not only does this ""not"" look like Tikka Masala but it doesn't taste like it at all. It has a very heavy ""Onion"" flavor to it rather than smokey tomato flavor, which is probably why they call this a ""spicy onion gravy"". If the package is MILD why then call it Spicy Onion? The product doesn't even come close to what is on the box. The box shows authentic white Paneer with a tikka masala gravy. What the packages really contain are Greyish-cubes they pass off as Paneer, and a onion soup colored gravy. Very misleading and not even in the same ballpark as Tikka Masala.<br /><br />I know I'm being harsh but the product is a little misleading. It really isn't a Tikka Masala like most are used to, but a Spicy Onion curry w/ low grade Paneer. Despite all these oddities, the gravy still is outstanding! Almost addictive I'd say! For the price you do get a delicious meal for 2 with each package that takes under 2 minutes to make. I still would recommend a purchase, and I would personally buy this myself it really is that good! Just understand that instead of an smokey tomato/onion gravy, you actually end up with a Spicy Onion gravy. If you do not like spicy food I would avoid this, however if you are a big fan of Indian Curry, and don't mind some spice, you can't go wrong. Just don't expect much from the Paneer or very much Tikka flavor.<br /><br />** Each Packet makes 3 servings ** (I found it really made more like 2 comfortable portions)<br />Calories: 180 per serving (540 total)<br />Fat: 9g (27g total)<br />Cholesterol: 24mg (72mg total)<br />Sodium: 400mg (1200mg total)<br />Carbs: 18g (54g total)<br />Fiber: 1g (3g total) / Sugar: 1g (3g total)<br />Protein: 8g ( 24g total )<br />Vitamin A: 2% per serving / C: 4% per serving / Calcium: 6% per serving / Iron: 2% per serving",A Delicious Curry But Poor Quality Paneer...,3

For years now, I've been purchasing similar products and have never had the opportunity to try one that claims to be influenced by the Himalayas.<br /><br />At $9, I have to say that this is hardly worth it. Sure, you get a full 3.5 oz chew, but it doesn't taste anything like the fresh, crisp mountain air of the mighty Himalayas, and it barely tastes like a dog from the region.

The flavor is still there (well, mostly) but the wonton fillings are no longer bulbous, filled sections, they are now paper-thin fillings(no exaggeration, it's just a thin line) - the wontons aren't round any more, they're flat! The wonton filling was the best (and main) part of the soup but it's practically gone now.<br /><br />I'm hoping they go back to their old recipe and not be so stingy on the filling. The wontons aren't abundant and they're tiny, so how much could it really cost to fill them and satisfy their customers?",They changed the recipe,3

"I am a big fan of Drinking vinegar and how versatile they are.<br /><br />I drink Hong Cho(Pulmuwon brand), mostly, and it was good for drinking, diluted in cold water, or served hot, but also it was fantastic salad dressing to my surprise. Hong cho tastes more like a fruit juice, and everyone who tastes it said they would drink it every day.<br /><br />(flavor)<br />However, this sempio(Sempyo, a popular Korean Soy Sauce maker)brand vinegar is below average in taste, and the sweet honey after taste didn't go well with the typical vinegar smell at the beginning. It is hard to describe, but some fermented or cough syrup-like not-so-delightful flavor, that is. Sip vinegar, sip some juice, and sip honey water, and you get sick. That was the experience from it.<br /><br />(packaging issue)<br />This Black Rice Vinegar comes in half the size bottles,in 4 bottles, probably equivalent to 2 bottles of Hong Cho . They arrive in a box, air-tight, in a clear document seal wrap, but it was not too securely packed with other items I ordered through amazon.com, when they were put together. SO, if UPS roughly handled it, any object inside the box would puncture the wrap easily inside the box. They will need some bubble wrap to fill the gap.<br /><br />Not, having too many options of drinking vinegar, I would encourage other users and put some more positive reviews for the benefit of accessible drinking vinegars in US market- I would keep this as my back up option. But, candidly speaking, I would stick to Hong Cho, if they are available on amazon.com again sometime soon.","Black rice vinegar has too much of separate flavors, Didn't feel good swallowing it.",3

"Not that I would expect something called ""Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn"" not to be sweet, but seriously, the first ingredient is brown sugar -- that's right, there is more brown sugar than popcorn in this!  The next three ingredients are popcorn, sugar, and corn syrup, so three out of the top four ingredients are sugars.  Also, 2.5 out of the 3 grams of fat in each serving are highly saturated palm oil (""and/or palm kernel oil,"" which is certainly no better).<br /><br />On the plus side, Nabisco appears to have made an effort to use only ""real"" foods in this snack:  skim milk, cocoa, salt, soybean oil, soy lecithin, and vanilla extract round out the list of ingredients.<br /><br />Snackwell's snacks are positioned as ""a sensible snack"" aimed at ""weight conscious women"" (from their own ad copy).  If you really want the fudge drizzle, and you can really eat just one pack, the Snackwell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn will definitely hit your sweet tooth and wouldn't be a horrible choice healthwise.  However, each pack provides just over an ounce of caramel corn, a handful, for 130 calories, 2.5 grams of saturated fat, and 190 mg of sodium (8% of the recommended daily value).<br /><br />Compare this to, say, Cracker Jack -- you can eat the whole box, peanuts and all, for 150 calories, 2.5 grams of fat (none of which is saturated fat), and only 90 mg of sodium.  Or, have a full cup of Orville Redenbacher's microwave caramel corn for 80 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, and a mere 20 mg of sodium, less than 1% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />In my book, that doesn't make Snackwell's the most sensible snack.","Tasty, not entirely unhealthy, VERY sweet",3
"We had tried a 1.75 oz glass shaker bottle awhile back and realized it was the pepper we were always reaching for at mealtime. So, we have been looking for ""McCormick Cracked Black Pepper"" ever since. I ordered this pepper as it was the same name, but it is much coarser (bigger grained) & not the same pepper as what was in our small spice bottle. I studied the empty spice bottle and noticed it also says ""Gourmet Collection"". Amazon states they do not accept returns on food items, so we were stuck with 2 big containers of this coarser pepper. I contacted McCormick and ordered the Gourmet Collection Cracked Black Pepper from them and the person guaranteed we would get the same exact pepper. When it arrived, it was indeed the same great pepper, but in a 1.62 oz (same style glass shaker bottle) & the label said Gourmet Collection Coarse Grind Black Pepper. Apparently, McCormick did some name changes. Also, the 2 big containers do not look like the picture - They have red lids with a rather plain black & white label - no green leaves or red McCormick label, etc. It does state they were packed in the USA by McCormick & Co. These big 16 ounce containers of pepper are probably okay pepper for grilling or where you want large specks of pepper, or perhaps could grind it in a mill for finer particles.",Not The Pepper I Thought,3

"I bought 3 doggy products at the same time (all treat dispensing chew toys). This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.<br /><br />I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.<br /><br />21 March 2012 Update<br /><br />I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose.

"Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.

Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.

"Purchased prod w/standard seed kit and regular basil was 2nd to sprout, but after 2 weeks it had a clear fungus...fury mold to all of it.  Out of remaining seeds in kit (my kit had cilantro which was replaced w/thyme)...thyme so far is producing the least.  Thyme was actually the 1st to sprout but is faltering in the long haul. The most aggresive growth is the mint.  Next it is neck & neck w/dill & chive.  I find myself cutting dill & chives to ""clear the shade"" in the hopes that the rest can catch up. I will say that I left a hydroponic tomatoe in the light of the machine...and in 2 weeks the fruit still looked fresh & the skin had visual bubbles or pimples in it.  When I opened the tomatoe nearly every seed had sprouted...yes SPROUTED within the tomatoe (so cool to see by the way - actual leaves inside a tomatoe!).  So I transplanted 4 seedlings into the empty basil ""herb pod"" and moved it to the back corner of the unit.  AeroGarden says the nutrients are different for herbs vs. vegetables...but if I can keep these sprots alive for another 4 weeks...I am in business with 4 REAL tomatoe plants.

"One tiny bottle of MIO easily makes 20+ drinks, so there are a lot of uses packed into this small package. This makes MIO perfect for keeping in a bag or in the car while out. Bring a reusable bottle of water, or keep some bottled waters in the car and add a few drops and you instantly have a sweet tea drink. Each tiny drop has a lot of flavor in it, so you on need a few to get the taste you're looking for. I like being able to adjust the strength of flavor to the size of the drink as well. If I bring a big travel bottle of water I am able to add more, or if I'm home and using just have a little cup, a drop or two will do.<br /><br />However I like the fruit punch flavor of the MIO better than this sweet tea. To get a lot of flavor into such a little package, it would seem a pretty strong artificial sweeter is used, and it does tend to leave an aftertaste that somewhat detracts from the tea taste. I think with the fruit punch flavor, it's a little less noticeable.<br /><br />If you don't really notice the taste of artificial sweeteners, than MIO is the perfect way to make yourself a quick drink on the go.",Good to take while on the road traveling,3

"I've been drinking coffee every morning of my adult life and in recent years have developed a fondness for flavored coffees. My favorites are mocha, cinnamon, and hazelnut. Thus I welcomed the opportunity to try a Starbucks flavored coffee, Natural Fusions no less.<br /><br />I love opening a fresh container of coffee to experience that heavenly burst of fresh, intense coffee aroma. When my bag of Starbucks Vanilla had its grand opening, I must say I was disappointed by the lack of a distinct vanilla aroma or anything resembling aroma. I figured I'd just have to wait for the actual brew to experience the promised vanilla flavor.<br /><br />So how is the coffee's vanilla flavor? Does it make up for the lack of that heavenly coffee scent that eluded me? Let's put it this way. If I were given a blind taste test,I'd be hard pressed to identfy this coffee as vanilla flavored. In fact, I'm not sure I could match any specific flavor to this coffee. It's obviously flavored to this taster, but I can only recognize that distant, nebulous vanilla taste because of the flavor's word printed on the bag.<br /><br />Overall this is a pleasant coffee. It's smooth, not bitter, and has a pleasant aftertaste. But if you are looking for a readily identifiable vanilla accent, you will have to be satisfied with vageuely vanilla.","Smooth, Not Bitter, but Vanilla?",3

"At the risk of exasperating the professed connoisseurs I must now review this product. Bought More Than Gourmet Jus De Poulet Lie Gold Roasted Chicken Demi-glace, 16-Ounce Packages plus 3 other ones for the nice hefty amount of $75.00 and some cents. What attracted me was the reduction ratio attributed to the preparation of this demi-glaze. My logic was sound when I said to myself: With this concentrated flavor at my hands I can create the most delightful culinary endeavors known to mankind, for if I have learned any thing as a wannabee is that taste and flavor is 90% of the work.<br />As this product stated it is supposed to be roasted chicken (french connotations and all) brought to the 20th degree in flavor. So the very first thing I did was to boil some clean water and add the substance to the liquid. The product had the texture of rubber soft enough to take chunks of it and use in the water.  This thrilled me at first because I deducted the amount of times it must have been reduced to reach this solid state, way past gelatin or perhaps a hard type of gelatin. I smelled it and could not really tell it was a chicken product. So in the boiling water it went and after proper stirring it dissolved completely. I served  what I would call a consomme to my partner in crime (in this try out) and one to moi.<br />This is the results and the reason I am allocating 3.5 Stars to the otherwise 5 Star reviews: After consuming a hot cup of chicken flavored broth I asked my lovely counterpart how did she like it? She said she liked it a lot, that it was so low in sodium that we both had to add a touch of sea salt and peppercorns. The thing is it did not taste in a significant way like chicken. She said it could have also been beef? I was desperately trying to find the chicken taste, the one one would get if you boil a whole chicken with a proper mirepoix, also the one you obviously get from the much cheaper and I am sure not pure powder Knorr's Chicken Broth or even the sodium based cubes. The point being that I did not taste chicken. Or smelled chicken while making it. So I ask: what is the use of using a chicken based demi glaze or broth or liquid if it does not taste or smell like it. I have used the Minor's Chicken and Turkey Base, that one fellow reviewer of these products line had belittle in comparison to this supposedly great product, and Minor's taste, smell and all around convey the chicken or turkey taste, respectively. So maybe is so purified that the whole chicken impact has evaporated?<br />That would be something If I did my favorite rotisserie chicken or baked a whole chicken and later added some white wine to the drippings and when I took the first bite no taste of chicken could be found. That, in a nutshell, is why in my personal opinion this product did not deliver. I expected an explosion of flavor once the thing dissolved but even though it was a fine cup of broth it did not identified itself well at all. 3.5 and I can not wait to try the other three and if they are similar to this one then Minor's still delivers a more honest, easy to discern taste . Or Savory Choice Liquid for that matter.<br />PS: Must admit that regardless whether this product tasted like chicken (which it does not) it still works on a gravy situation. I did a roast and used red wine and mostly this product and by the end of the day, after slow cooking the roast for several hours, I had the most appealing broth or gravy that went very well with everything else. The texture remains very solid, almost like rubber, but with a sharp utensil it is a matter of digging in and pulling a chunk and have to make sure it is totally dissolved for if not is almost like glue. Perhaps a nice 4 Stars instead?",3.5 Stars,3
"As sugar-free gums go, this gum is awful.  The taste dissipates in no time, and the gum itself is far from elastic.<br /><br />Yet I still buy it.  Why?  Because it uses only XYLITOL as its sweetener, a substance that actually reverses tooth decay (minor reversal, mind you, but, well... I'll take anything).  It's actually GOOD for teeth.<br /><br />Other gums on the market that taste better have XYLITOL as an ingredient, but they also include other sugar-free sweeteners.<br /><br />Here's what Wikiipedia says about XYLITOL:  ""Xylitol is a 'toothfriendly' sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries. Recent research[7] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then ""starves"" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption.""<br /><br />On top of all this, XYLITOL might actually improve bone density.<br /><br />Taste?

I thought those were always included, so I was bummed.  I'm taking away another star because I just re-read the description, and it claims that the packets include new flavors like pineapple (my 3rd favorite) and mango.  Neither flavor is present.<br /><br />The packets I received include banana (#1 fav!), red hearts, orange, grape, and green apple.

"I tried this cookie at the same time I tried Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  These cookies are better than Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies, but they still fall short of what I expect from Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies.<br /><br />I have given up expecting products to look like their packages.  I suppose there is a bit of artistic license in making food look as though your mom and grandmother whipped it out of a bunch of basic ingredients.  The problem, of course, is that the cookies bear little resemblance to the picture on the package.  Things seem to go downhill from there.<br /><br />Try putting one of these cookies on a napkin next to the package.  The picture on the package is beautiful, with chocolate chips on the outside and gooey chocolate in the middle.  I could barely see the chocolate chips on the cookie itself because something, crumbs I think, covered the chocolate chips.  None of my cookies were lovely and round like the one of the package.  Instead, my cookies were mostly broken and I had a difficult time removing more than fragments from the package.<br /><br />Well, beauty is only chip deep, I suppose.  The important features are the taste and the texture.<br /><br />The texture was okay.  The cookie seemed chewy and moist to me.  In general, I thought the texture of these cookies compared favorably with regular Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies.<br /><br />The taste was okay.  The taste was hardly great, but okay.  I tasted cookie dough and then a chocolate hit, about what I expected for chewy chocolate chip cookies.  What I missed was the creamy chocolate in the center of the cookie.  I tried several of these cookies, trying to taste the creamy chocolate in the middle.  My taste buds could not separate the taste of the supposedly creamy chocolate from the other flavors in the cookie.<br /><br />These cookies need to compete with regular Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies along with dozens of other varieties.  In order to do that, a new cookie should be phenomenally good to convince customers to change brands.  However, this cookie is hardly phenomenally good.  In my opinion, this cookie is just average.  I believe there are many better options available, particularly given the price of these cookies.  My prediction is that either this variety will disappear from store shelves or its formula will change.  Meanwhile, you have plenty of other, better choices.<br /><br />Good luck!","The taste and texture were okay, but is this the best option?",3

"Last weekend we candied the peel from about 28 pounds of oranges (a box from a Florida Grower that was a gift.)using a number of recipes for candied peel as guides. We made orange juice and ordered a citrus juicing attachment for our Kitchenaid because that many oranges was a lot of work! We were happy with our candied peel, but wanted to see how it compared to comerically available items so we ordered 4 ounces of orange peel from France -- the most expensive peel -- as well as the most recommended, less expensive peel<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KP6B98"">Candied Orange Peel Slices 2 lbs (32 oz.)</a><br />This morning, we dipped samples of all peels in the same dipping chocolate<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NE44E0"">Ghirardelli Chocolate Candy Making & Dipping Bar, Double Chocolate Flavor 2.5 Lbs</a><br />This peel, currently being reviewed was mediocre. It contains much more pith (the white layer under the zest) than ours did, as we were careful to follow Pepin's instructions given in ""La Method"". As a result of the higher percentage of pith, the candied peel was much more bland than our home candied peel, and less vibrant in color.<br />We concluded that candying peel at home makes much more sense that buying candied peel. It's easy -- the cost is really only the sugar as we either composed the peels or fed them to the cattle previously -- who love them by the way!<br />The packaging of this peel is fabulous, but the peel itself is mediocre.","Good candied orange peel, but not great.",3

They do make a nice froth and I got used to the taste after a couple packages.  However, I was going in expecting them to taste the same and they definitely do not.  Unfortunately Senseo has pulled out of the US market so these are what we get.  It is better than nothing though, and at least they are available locally.

"***<br /><br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot""; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""citrus, lavender, light smoke"".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out.

The powder is much less flavorful than the liquid.  The smell is not obvious (expected for powder).  However, this same effect carries over into the product.  The powder and liquid measurements are supposed to be equivalent.  However, putting in 1/2 tsp of powder resulted in minimal scent and taste.  I ended up using twice as much powder as liquid to get an equivalent effect.  The powder is a much weaker flavoring product than the liquid.

"Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.

"This is coming from a chocolate lover.  I ordered the ""extreme chocolate"" cookies thinking I was up for a challenge.  Well, they are good but not great.  I can't believe I'm saying this but the chocolate is actually overwhelming.  I'm saving the rest of the bags to make a chocolate crust for my cheesecake but I won't order this type again.  I do agree that it almost tastes like the top part of an oreo but with more intense taste.  My husband hated them and my 3 year old wasn't fond of it.

"As raven wrote, these bites are not chewy nor are they extra chewy as the package states.  In fact, these bites are just a tad softer than some rocks.

"Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally.","Perfect size, but goes quickly",3

"Haribo Happy Cola Gummi Candies are decent for fans of gummies like myself.  I've tried everything from gummi bears to gummi sharks to gummi toes, but gummi cola has a rather strange flavor.  Take a glass bottle of Coke, drink half of it, leave it in the fridge for a couple of days (uncapped) and then drink it again.  This will give you an idea as to how these gummies taste.  It's a flat, refrigerator-tainted Coke taste.  It actually brings back memories as a child of drinking old Coke from the bottle.  That's a plus for older folks like myself.  However, I must admit that there are far better gummies out there.  Try these out if you just have to have a cola flavored gummi.

"I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0"">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW"">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct.

I bought the Seitenbacher sight unseen as it were (have never seen it offered locally so I couldn't taste test) based on all the positive reviews.  I guess it's okay but frankly I don't like it as much.  It doesn't dissolve as easily and the flavor is pretty drab in my opinion.  Fortunately [sic] I have to use a lot more of it to even get a flavor so I'll be done with this case before too long.

"I drink a lot of coffee and ergo use a lot of sugar, but am trying to cut sugar out of my diet.  Although I will use Splenda, I am not fond of the aftertaste.  I've tried Truvia too, which also has an aftertaste.  I guess since none of these sugar substitutes are really sugar, they're all going to have an aftertaste.  So while this product is no different, the slight vanilla flavor helps to either cut down on the aftertaste or distracts your tastebuds from it.  One downside is that the bottle goes quickly for hardcore coffee drinkers, which probably more expensive than just straight Splenda.  Overall, I think it's a good alternative to sugar and would recommend it to those who are trying to cut down on sugar consumption.",Good way to wean yourself off sugar...,3
"These apples taste fine, since there are no artificial additives, but they sure are small.  The average piece is 1/2 an inch by 1/2 an inch, which is quite pathetic and unsatisfying (for me).  I have to eat multiple pieces at once to notice any apple-like aromas.  I do appreciate the crunch but they also detracts from the sweetness, because its harder to dissolve and release the sugars when the pieces are this dry.  It's not a bad product, but I would not buy it again.",Why are the pieces so small?,3

I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses.

However, one of our two cats has a more sensitive stomach - and after eating this food she's had litterbox issues a few times - deciding to do her business right outside the litterbox in a rather non-solid mess. Our other cat has done fine, but the smell in the litterbox has been nothing short of awful when she forgets to cover up after doing her business.<br /><br />Overall, I don't really care for this product and probably won't buy it again.

She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can. She's only been on it for 24 hours and has already started showing gas signs and has been spitting up all evening. Not sure if she just needs time to adjust or what.

It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.

According to the label of the bottle I have on hand, there is no starch, but still it feels that way.  Like cornstarch- soft, silky, but not something I would seek out in my quest for hydration.

"First I want to be clear; the coffee itself is great, or would be, if it arrived correctly. The coffee comes in a vacuum-sealed package (or is supposed to come like that). This is to keep the beans fresh, and after the package is opened, you're supposed to store it in the freezer, to continue to keep the beans fresh.<br /><br />The problem is, the packages you receive are not vacuum-sealed. The seals are broken and the beans are at some degree of staleness on arrival. You don't know how stale they are because you don't know how long it's been since the vacuum seals were broken. It still tastes like coffee, you can still taste the macadamia and the chocolate, but you can also tell that it's a bit off-flavor as well.<br /><br />This is a great coffee, but don't purchase it through this seller unless you don't mind receiving stale beans.",Not fresh on arrival,3
"I've sampled three coffees that had received a lot of 4/5-star reviews, and after tasting all three, I would rank this coffee third in the group.  I agree with another reviewer that coffee preferences are a very personal and subjective matter, but here are my brief comments about the three I tasted.<br /><br />I found the Lavazza Super Crema smooth, but ""flat"" as far as aroma and taste.  I had bought this one based on the review of several persons, one of whom had drunk it while growing up in his native Italy.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Maybe one of their other varieties is better?  I'm reluctant to take a second gamble.<br /><br />I bought a bag of Blue Mountain Blend after my fiance said she liked it, even after she had tried the pure Blue Mountain Jamaican whole bean coffee several times.  I noticed that the bag looked way too big for the 2lbs. of coffee beans in it.  To me, that indicates room for air space that would cause freshness to be compromised.  Nevertheless, the coffeeForever48 behaved like a total jerk.<br /> And I mean that in the nicest way possible. I made had a nice smooth, strong taste, but I still would rank it second.<br /><br />My number 1 ranking goes to Marley coffee's Jammin' Java Lion's Blend.  It had a rich flavor with just a hint of ""roastiness"" that added a pleasing note to its taste.  This one I will buy again.  Bear in mind that Jammin' Java is not necessarily Jamaican coffee beans, but as I indicated above, personal taste is what counts.  The Marley beans are slightly smaller, darker, and more oily than the other two.<br /><br />I am open to any other reviewer suggestions...<br /><br />10/01/11 Update - Brewed both the Blue Mountain Blend and the Lavazza Super Crema in a French Press after grinding in a fairly high-rated conical grinder.  Blue Mountain Blend wins competition hands down, IMO.  The Lavazza is strong, but does not have the pleasing notes in the aftertaste that the BMB has.  Will add to this review after I try French Pressing the Jammin' Java.","Had hopes, but...",3

"Lickety Stik is an interesting idea.

So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy.

"I was happy to find out that Pom Wonderful has already shelled pistachios. Like the unshelled version these are salty (160mg of sodium per serving of 1/4 cup), but I tend to eat them as a snack with some fruit & water to balance it out. On occasion I have found a few nuts that taste a little ""too"" roasted. But nothing that would prevent me from purchasing this brand again, as long as the price is decent.<br /><br />The only thing I would warn about is to be mindful of who you are purchasing this product from. The last time I got these pistachios was from the Amazon seller ""BargainHunters"" and it came with a hole in the packaging (large enough for an insect or lizard to crawl into). Tried contacting them about it but they ignored me. That was disappointing because overall their seller feedback is pretty decent (over 90% positive).

"Ok, I picked these up at my local Trader Joe's...they're not bad, but I have three issues that would cause me to pass these by next time:<br /><br />1. they just don't have enough of a peanut buttery taste. They're more like buttery corn muffins with a hint of peanut butter flavor. I do like that they are not overly sweetened, but it needs a bit more peanut butter flavor.<br /><br />2. The cereal isn't stale, but I like the way another reviewer stated the texture/crunch, sort of like a crouton that is just starting to go stale....<br /><br />3. The puffs are way too big. I can just about get only two or three in my mouth and milk is drooling out all over the place. But just putting one on a spoon isn't enough (I know, picky...).  Oh, and get ready for the scrappage of skin from the roof of your mouth. It's like sandpaper.  So I'm eating these now as a snack without the milk and spoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />So that sums it up.  I'm eating the cereal and enjoying it (albeit the last three comments), but next time, I'll pass. Might pick them up again if they go on sale, but I would be using it more as a healthy snack and not a cereal.",Wanted them to taste more peanut buttery (and another 1/2 star to make it 3 1/2),3

"Aloe. Green Tea. Passion Fruit.<br /><br />Choose any two. (Also, make the Passion Fruit less dominant than it is.) By combining all three flavors, it becomes too much.

There's no high-fructose corn syrup, for those of you who are into that sort of thing. The flavors are purportedly all natural. There's nothing on the ingredient label that an eleven-year old couldn't pronounce, so there's that.<br /><br />As a side note, and warning to anyone who might not know, aloe, while really good for your skin, should be consumed internally with moderation. For one thing, it's an allergen. So, before you buy a case of this stuff, buy a small sample and find out if you're going to be allergic.

"I am a coffee lover, have automatic espresso machine, used to roast my own beans, etc. When I read the reviews on this coffee, particularly that it would be freshly roasted prior to shipping I was attracted. I purchased five pounds and I have to say I was disappointed.  You can see when coffee is freshly roasted by the foam it leaves in the filter when you brew it. You can also taste a freshness.  This coffee had neither.

"I love blow pops. They taste great and last a long time. They have a big problem. It's very difficult to remove the wrapper. What happens is the wrapper sticks to the stick and you can't pull it off. They must use super glue. You might think it's a safety feature, but you can take the wrapper off the portion that covers the edible part fairly easily. You're forced to eat the lollipop with a plastic wrapper in your mouth.

"I am still experimenting with the best mix for me, but so far, the milk is too overwhelming for a person in me that likes his chocolate/cereal/etc. with his milk rather than the other way around.  In other words, I'm tasting too much of the milk and it's not a taste I care for.  It is better than the cheap stuff like store brand or Swiss, etc. but I would much rather use it in my espresso machine than boil off milk (will be one of my next experiments).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Very good chocolate.  I have used the straight cooking based Ghiradelli cocoa and it is intense, but good actually in an espresso type situation.  I'm thinking this stuff should be a bit less intense than the cocoa made for cooking and be even better for my personal purpose with it.<br /><br />-Beats the store brand or use with water stuff if you either have the mix down or do not mind the extra milky taste.<br /><br />-Even though milk has to be used and milk does cost more than free water, the chocolate is not only worth it but cost to cost, the intensity level of Ghiradelli vs. Swiss or other is a lot higher.  In other words, while Swiss may be cheaper on paper, it will take a TON more to get to the same intensity level as Ghiradelli AND it will not taste as good.  So the having to buy milk is really the only additional cost factor going on here.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-I have yet to figure out a good enough potion that makes the taste less milky.  If I cannot figure one out, I will have to downgrade this review for the product being of use for only specific people or applications.<br /><br />-Have to buy milk and with such a nice chocolate, I'd recommend an organic or nice albeit expensive milk.  I will update this review if I find that using water/espresso machine/etc. factors can take the a good bit of milk out of the equation.<br /><br />So there you have it.  More pros than cons from me, though I am only partially satisfied at this point.  Will update if I can figure out how to nail down better solutions to my liking, and if anything, I can always use it how I did with the Ghiradelli type made for cooking!

"I can't give more than a 3 star average for this item, when considering the flavor and taste of this ""organic chocolate"" bar.<br /><br />Like some other Newman's Own food products that I've tasted, it doesn't offer any special quality, other than that the ingredients are virtually all ""organic"".  Unfortunately, our local, state and Federal requirements for ""organic"" foods, are severely flawed, and this product potentially  illustrates this problem quite well.<br /><br />The ingredients in these chocolate bars may meet most standards for organic foodstuffs, but there is an important element missing in the case of chocolate, that most people don't understand.<br /><br />I have read several articles recently about the high lead content of much of the chocolate that we consume, and for a period of time this problem was presumed to be that the cocoa beans themselves were (are) contaminated with lead, due to the leaded gasoline  in the engines of the farming equipment used in those countries that grow cocoa beans.<br /><br />However, some articles mention that lab analyses show that raw cocoa beans themselves have a relatively low amount of lead in them, compared to the final, processed chocolate products (and compared to other similar food products).  Some observant writers have then suggested that the high lead concentrations in cocoa products, are probably due to lead in the air near and over the drying beds, where the beans themselves are dried.  The reason for this contamination would be similar to the original theories, since there is likely high lead content in the air around these drying beds, for the prior reasoning (the lead in the gasoline used on the cocoa bean farms is emitted by tractor and other vehicle exhaust,  and then these contaminants attach themselves to the drying cocoa beans).<br /><br />At any rate, if the price of Newman's Own organic dark chocolate is as high as I suspect it is,  I would recommend buying a cheaper brand of chocolate bar (""organic"" or not), since there's no way to know whether Newman's Own chocolate has less (or more) lead in it, than other brands do.","This product illustrates the deficiencies of the term ""organic""",3
"While I can't fault this shampoo for it's effectiveness on dandruff, it accomplishes that goal somewhat harshly with regard to my hair. It leaves it very dry and makes my scalp itchy.<br /><br />I've used other versions of this brand that have a conditioner built-in, and it seems that's a necessity to both get rid of the dandruff without causing problems.<br /><br />On the plus side, it lathers well and the scent is nice. It would probably be fine if you followed it with a conditioner, but on its own it's a bit to harsh for my needs.","Does the job, but a bit harsh",3
"I have been using this shampoo for a week now. I have been using it alone, without the additional conditioner. My hair is long, straight and very fine. I use volumizing shampoos as a matter of routine. I usually move between <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ISB3AG"">Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139353Q"">Paul Mitchell Thickening Shampoo, Lemon Sage</a>. Both of these work great for me, although they have different issues. Pantene is instant volume, but coats your hair. Lemon Sage, if used with the conditioner, works well but costs a good bit more. It also creates build-up, but not nearly as quickly.<br /><br />I found this shampoo pretty much on par with those (left my hair soft, full and pleasantly but not strongly scented), with one exception - my hair looks pretty good immediately after I wash it, but not so good the day after, and since I typically wash my hair in the evening this means I don't get the benefit when I want it most. Both Pantene and Lemon Sage seem to last from shampoo to shampoo.<br /><br />Like Pantene, this product does build-up. The effect of this is to actually weigh down your hair and make it look flat and greasy. This can be counteracted by periodically using a good clarifying shampoo - weekly or every other week. I'm in-between at the moment, as the one I've used for some time has gone off the market. I wound up picking up <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027C9CS"">Suave For Men, Deep Clean Peppermint</a> even though I'm not a man, because it was the only one the store I was in seemed to carry, and I was out. But I'm in the market for something better. This one strips away the build-up, but it's very harsh; it actually burns my scalp.<br /><br />I experienced the same problem many others have reported: while it was only a small amount, my bottle leaked in shipment. I doubt I lost much product, but who would want to lose any? If I ever decide to pick this up again (and I may not, given the next day issue), I'll probably look for it in a store.<br /><br />I'll note that the product may perform better with the matching conditioner, but it might also lead to quicker product build-up.",Serviceable shampoo perhaps better suited for buying in person,3

If your pet doesn't eat kibble but you still want to give treats, I don't think this offers anything that any other tiny treat doesn't offer.  It's actually less convenient to hold the Lickety Stik for your dog to lick than it is to just toss a treat.<br /><br />Also, the first ingredient listed (this is the Savory Chicken flavor) is ""natural chicken flavor.""  Do a little reading and you'll quickly realize this doesn't necessarily mean an actual chicken was involved anywhere in this product.  Aside from that there is cultured lecithin (I have no idea what the ""cultured"" modifier means in this context), vitamins E and C, rosemary extract, and green tea extract.  None of this sounds harmful, but none of it sounds particularly nutritionally helpful, either.<br /><br />As far as dogs' opinions, we had an even split at my house.  Both dogs thought it smelled good and eagerly licked it initially.  One dog has not only refused it since that first taste, but actually pulls back from it when it's offered (and this is a dog that eats anything -- animal, vegetable, mineral, paper towel, cardboard...).  The other is happy to lick from it until I take it away.  I'll probably let her continue to use it until it's gone, but I don't see myself adding more of it to my pet-treat cupboard.",Mostly a product without a purpose,3

After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.

"This coffee has excellent flavor. The only trouble with these cups: the plastic on the cups is thicker than other brands. You must press firmly when placing them in the machine to make sure the bottom of the cup is punctured, before closing. If you do not, you will have a mess. The machine backs up with grounds and spits out grounds and little water. I tried another brand just to make sure my machine wasn't broke. The other brand, I placed in the maker and closed the lid.

First off, it is so finely ground that it doesn't stick to the dry popcorn.  Even worse, it tends to float in the air and I end up inhaling it (which is unpleasant).  I think for this to work I'd have to wet the popcorn in some way (with water or butter?) to get it to stick, but I'm not looking for that level of effort.

"I like bold coffee, which this was promoted as a bold, dark brew. I've had better but this isn't bad. It has a dark roast flavor that really attacks the palette, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste, which I don't really care for. I'm glad I tried it and I have enjoyed it as my morning brew but I probably wouldn't order another box. I have also experienced some of the kcups leaking during the brewing, spreading dark, hot coffee with the grounds all over and down the front of the brewer leaving an absolute mess. It's bad enough for this to happen once in awhile, but this has happened three times and I'm not even half-way through the box (BTW, Amazon's frustration-free packaging is really great!). I see what is happening is that the foil on the top of the cup breaks loose allowing the coffee to be forced out over the top. Now, I must look over each KCup very carefully before I use it. Maybe I just got a bad batch but I can't wait for it to be gone.<br />UPDATE. I separated out the cups that look like they might explode. Of the 28 kcups left, 17 (over half) looked like they would fail. I was right on all but 4 of them! With this batch of 50 kcups, nearly half of them failed during the brewing process.

One can of that and a can of evaporated mix and you have an instant pumpkin pie pudding or topping, no cooking needed because it is precooked when canned.

OMG.  Who dreamt up this recipe?  Is this stuff raw and not to be eaten without being cooked first?  It taste like molasses and pie spice.  It looks like molasses and pie spice.  It's brown instead of orange.  OMG, who wants to buy my remaining cans?  I got 7 left.  This stuff tastes like crap if you try to use it as an uncooked sauce like Libby's.  OK, so Libby's taste like liquid pumpkin candy pudding.  It might really be typical unhealthy American diet fare.  I dunno except it tastes fabulous.  This stuff tastes like medicine in comparison.

I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.","Over all, fairly good",3

"I bought the 5-pack a while ago and have been cooking each pack on and off for about a year and a half.  I just finished making the last packet and finally tweaked it to my liking.  I LOVE butter chicken at Indian restaurants, but I found that if you followed the instructions exactly on this packet, it doesn't taste anything like what I get in the restaurants (please no arguments about ""authenticity"").  What I did this last time was add MORE butter (around 5 tablespoons...closer to 6), add about 1/4 cup of 2% milk instead of 1 cup of water, about 3 tablespoons of honey, salt to taste (I usually hate adding additional salt when using spice mixes) and coconut milk instead of heavy cream at the end.

It's definitely cheaper than going out, and it's nice to know that I can get close to what I get in the restaurants whenever I get a butter chicken craving.","Needs some tweaking, but a good mix.",3
"I used to love this coconut and order it all the time. However, for some reason, recently the coconut has started becoming drier and drier, indicating more heat processing. Also, it is less tasty than before. This change has occurred throughout the last few months. I will no longer purchase this item as a result.",Used to be better,3
"When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this ""puppy goo"".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!",Careful with this!,3
"This was quite tasty, but the saltiness was overwhelming. If you have to limit your salt intake, steer clear of this item.","Tasty, but. . .",3
"I was really excited to find these prepackaged meals just as I was leaving for a trip.  Needing to be GF & traveling across the country can make it a challenge.  Eating at restaurants is always chancy, no airline knows whether or not they have GF food (most don't but you can check the peanuts), and the last thing you want is to be sick on your trip.  So I jumped at ordering these ""gluten free"" meals when I found them!  And they are pretty good!  It would be nice, since they have a lovely little spork included, if they threw a little napkin in too, but hey, it's not the end of the world.  What IS a bit of a concern for anyone that has to avoid gluten or contain with gluten at all costs is the fact that the chocolate square is NOT gluten free, as marketed.  It is only ""no gluten ingredients"".  There is a disclaimer on the box that states ""Organic Dark Chocolate Square: made on equipment that also produces soy, milk, wheat, peanut, and tree nuts.""  You can't do that when the label says ""gluten-free"" because you can not guarantee the chocolate in GF.  So yes, you could just avoid the chocolate, but I think they either need to put an obvious disclaimer in their product info (all but chocolate are GF or something)or change from the Terra Nostra Organic chocolate to something that truly IS gluten-free.<br /><br />So if you buy it and you know you can't have something produced on shared equipment, just throw out the chocolate.","Yummy, but one item produced on wheat equipment!",3
"I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in!",Taste good but NOT truly MSG-FREE,3
"My husband and I were excited to try this assortment since it boasted the ability to try 25 different flavors without buying 25 different boxes.

Thankfully, we're already fans of the Pumpkin Spice, or I'm sure we'd be a little irked about the disproportionate number of those in our bag.  With that said, we're satisfied with the purchase, but simply wish that the product listing did not indicate that 25 different flavors would be included.",NOT a 25 flavor assortment as described.,3

"Just got this brand for the first time.  I gave been using the ""Lou-Ana"" brand from<br />a local store that is refined.  From my understanding, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut<br />oil has a more cocount taste, smell and more nutritious.  From what I see, there's<br />no difference in taste and smell.

"These aren't the worst things you could put in your mouth, I'm sure, but after being used to Monster M-80, Monster MIXXD, or Rockstar Juiced, they just don't taste like anything special. I think part of the problem is there are just too many juices vying for your taste buds' attention; apple, orange, pear, peach, tangerine, pineapple, and white grape, to be exact. Dropping the orange would be a huge step in the right direction, in my opinion, and maybe even the tangerine and pear.<br /><br />As for the energy ""kick,"" they seem to work fine - about as well as anything else I've consumed. Honestly, it may be more of a placebo effect for me, anyway (caffeine has never kept me from sleeping at night or given me any sort of drastic boost in energy - for all I know, it could just be sipping a cold and fizzy drink that gives me what tiny boost I do notice), so it's hard to tell. But if you're looking for great taste in a natural energy drink, I would recommend trying Guru (probably the best-tasting one I've found), or even the normal Blue Sky Blue Energy drink - neither taste quite as good as the Monsters I mentioned above, but for me, given their more natural ingredients, they taste good enough to justify the switch.","Not great, but better than some of the alternatives.",3
"Tested on RUGER, 11 year old male neutered beagle type dog, 17 inches high and 25 pounds. Moderate activity level.<br />Slightly crazy, very lovable, goofy disposition, quite the momma's boy.<br /><br />Over a week I offered this food to my dog along side a bowl of his regular diet. His regular diet is Purina D/H mixed Loyall Lamb and Rice kibble.<br />He is a pretty predictable dog, and every day he chose to eat his D/H chunks out first, then a few kibbles of the Loyall, than he would eat a few bites of the Chef Michaels.<br />So, he did like it, and he did eat it.<br />There were a few things that drew my attention.<br />1. No where on the bag does it say where the ingredients are sourced. Is he eating American beef? Mexico?<br />Now, it doesn't say where his food is sourced on his D/H (Purina Dental Health) BUT, he loves that food SO MUCH and it keeps his teeth so nice I do continue to feed it to him. After all, I can't source where all the ingredients I EAT come from, so why should my dog eat better than I do? So, it isn't a major issue, but for those who really want to know, well, you will have to contact Purina.<br />2. The food felt FLUFFY and a bit greasy, and the red dyed beefy bits drifted with handling to the top. So, you have to shake before serving to get the kibbles to mix in a more uniform way before feeding. Otherwise, your dog gets a bowl of soft beefy bits and no kibble.<br />3. The kibble pieces did not seem crunchy enough to prevent tartar build up. Hummm. Perhaps after a long feeding diet of this your pet will NEED Purina D/H. I may be on to something here. I doubt this diet will do anything for dental health for your dog.<br />4. Why add artificial colors? Really? He doesn't even look at the food. At 11 years old, His sight may be questionable anyway and as a BEAGLE he doesn't look in the bowl before eating. He sniffs everything. To my dog, smell is everything. And for most dogs, I've never seen them eye each piece of kibble before chowing down. I seriously doubt dogs care if the potato bits are brown, the green bean kibbles are green, or the meat is red. Actually, after cooking, it should be brown as well. The colors can be left out, they are unnecessary. BUT, then again, as a kid who grew up on Kool-Aid, Mom enjoyed mixing up all those great colorful drinks for us, and we grew up fine (twitch twitch) but I state again, no sense in my dog eating better than me. (Now I want some red fruity punch just writing this)<br />5. Serving size is WAY too much. Each cup of this food has 270 calories. THAT IS A LOT! 28% protein and 16% fat. That is a bit more protein and fat than my guy is used to, so, it may be a bit ""rich"" for some dogs. ALSO, take notice, not all that protein is from those dried beefy looking chewy chunks. There are other sources of proteins in here, from Chicken by product meal, corn gluten, and soy. These are all sources of protein, but it may seem misleading if you think the protein is all from beef (which is, by the way, the number one ingredient)<br />6. The fat is ""animal fat"" so your guess is as good as mine. Emu? Llama? Pig? Sheep? Deer? Bison? Snake? Who knows, they should just label it ""mystery fat"" and I hope soylent green is not some of the green bits.<br /><br />I know, it sounds like I am knocking the food, and I really am not. It is DOG FOOD. My dog goes outside and eats rabbit poo, so I feel this bag of food is at least more nutritionally complete than rabbit poo.<br />And again, some of our human foods aren't much better, so I don't feel guilty feeding this to my dog while I enjoy a cool glass of Kool-Aid and chow down on some McDonald's Fries-- OCCASIONALLY.<br />In a perfect world, we would all eat nuts and berries, and fresh protein sources. If you want to feed your dog dog food you are pretty limited on types and styles. This is the junk food style dog food. I would give it occasionally as a treat (as I also do everything in moderation, I am not eating fries and KoolAid daily)<br />But I don't think I could feed this in good conscience to my dog daily, unless I added some FRESH raw meat and some pureed veggies, and probably I'd have to add something crunchy for dental health.<br /><br />This diet would probably be good for dog with rotten teeth already who find it too painful to eat regular foods and whose owners would rather put them on this instead of looking into their mouth problem.<br />Also, it would be good for picky eaters, whose owners would rather feed them this than find out why their dog's appetite is lacking.<br />This diet would also be good for training, you can take the bits out and use them as training treats. But take a rag, they leave a residue on your hands.","The Chef is in, but is he cooking my dog ""fast food?""",3
"When I first received the bag and opened it, I was in heaven. The smell of this coffee is amazing. However, the taste doesn't measure up to the smell.<br /><br />Some background: I love strong coffee and can't stand the thought of putting sugar in it. So far, I have used this coffee in my espresso machine to make cappuccinos.<br /><br />First, let me comment on the crema. I was expecting more. From reading other reviews, I expected the thickest crema I'd ever seen. In fact, the crema is about the same as with most brands of coffee I use in my machine. Depending upon how fine I grind the coffee, how much coffee I use, and how tightly I pack the coffee, the crema is better or worse. This brand didn't make any noticeable difference.<br /><br />From a flavor standpoint, I find this coffee rather weak. It might be okay straight up as espresso, but once I add steamed milk, it's quite watery. I brewed it side by side with Costco's Kirkland Espresso (Starbuck's roast), and the Kirkland brand is much bolder and more intense.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a strong coffee, one with intense flavor, this isn't the coffee for you.",Not as strong as I would have liked,3

"I deducted one star for the ""pure vanilla powder"" name, and another for not being as aromatic as pure vanilla, so 3 stars.  I read the description above and thought I scrutinized the wording well enough to detect any misdirection, so unfortunately I didn't get to the ingredients list.  I have some Rodelle vanilla pods and the fragrance is amazing.  Compared to any vanilla essence I've ever tried, it's like the difference between freshly roasted coffee beans and folgers.  So I thought this ""pure vanilla powder"" would be the closest thing ([...] bucks for a little jar!), and easier to use than vanilla pods.  Well it turns out it's a jar of essentially corn syrup solids laced with vanilla extract.<br /><br />It's hard to avoid maltodextrin in pre-processed foods from the supermarket, but I'd rather not have it in my homemade foods too.  It's a good thing that there's a powder version on the market, because it has its own kind of convenience, but it doesn't seem to me any more fragrant than regular extract,  and unlike other reviewers' experience it seem like I do have to use more than liquid extract (also it cakes up terribly). Might be worth $3.50+shipping for the added convenience of the powder, but otherwise it's a pretty pedestrian product.  Win some, learn some...",Pure vanilla powder made of maltodextrin,3

"This is the sort of thing that is handy to keep on hand for quickly doctoring up a simple meal.  It's definitely not awesome pesto; think of it more as a condiment, like mustard or ketchup.  What I typically use it for, in that regard, is as a spread on sandwiches, when I'm tired of the usual versions.  It works well in particular on sandwiches featuring cheese or poultry.  It doesn't have much kick on its own as a sauce for pasta; but it can be added to things like frozen pasta dinners or canned soups etc. to give them a little more flavor.<br /><br />One thing I want to mention too is that this product can ""spit"" and spatter when trying to squeeze it out.  When you are ready to open a tube, be sure you pierce the opening fully, so that any chunks within won't get stuck; and keep the bottom of the tube squeezed and rolled up to compact the remainder in the tube as best you can.","Not Stellar Pesto, But Product Has Its Uses",3

I tried adding it to the oil instead of sprinkling it on the popcorn after its popped. I think I prefer it that way. I would recommend adding it to the oil before you put the popcorn in.

"UPDATE (12/3/2011): The food in the last case that I bought was substantially different from previous cases. The pieces were much thicker and of a tougher consistency. Because of this, my cat was only licking up the gravy, picking at a few pieces, and leaving the rest in the dish. I don't know if it was more difficult to eat or less palatable, but I ended up having to donate the rest of the cans to an animal shelter. Because of the wide variation in preparation, I had to stop buying this food for Moxie.<br /><br />ORIGINAL: My cat goes crazy for this wet food. When he was younger (about 7 months ago), I tried to give him the same brand dry food supplemented with this wet food, but we had vomit problems with the wet food. When I re-introduced this wet food about a month ago because I was concerned about only giving him dry food, it was like night and day. He gobbles it all up every day, and there have been no vomit issues whatsoever. He knows that morning time is when he gets his morsels, and he sits in the middle of the kitchen and cries until I give it to him.<br /><br />I like that this food comes in larger chunks rather than tiny shredded pieces. It reduces the mess the cat makes in and around his bowl. I also like that there are few artificial ingredients, just like the same version dry food. The cans are only 3 ounces each, which is small if this were the only food you're feeding your cat, but for our purposes of half a can supplement a day, it's perfect. I just feed half a can and put the other half in the fridge for the next day.",Changed their preparation - consistency issues?,3

"For some people, excessive coffee consumption can pose health problems or it might just make it hard to sleep at night or give them the jitters.

The sharp contrast in taste and lack of caffeine often makes this a solution doomed to failure. A better method is to add some Postum to your coffee or to have the ""Postum"" at night if you can take the caffeine during the day and simply let your body tell you how much caffeine you are okay about replacing in this manner.<br /><br />Of course, you could apply the same approach with decaffeinated coffee, so it is a matter of taste.

"They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites.

Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right.

One in particular was mold that makes penicillin.

So the research was being done In Peoria, Illinois and all the housewives in Peoria were instructed to bring all there moldy food to the lab.

"This is a bigger tin (compared to the regular, unflavoured product -- but the fish content is also lower, so the difference is probably the sauce). The taste is quite good, I must say, but let us look at the ingredients (taken directly from a tin):<br />Herring Fillets (60%), water, mustard (water, mustad seeds, spirit vinegar, salt, spices, natural flavourings), sugar, vegetable oil, spirit vinegar, Thickener: guar gum, carregeenan; Seasonings (with celery, soy, gluten), salt, tomato paste. (Contains: Herring, mustard, celery, soy, gluten).<br /><br />And so, the regular kippers come in smaller tins but the fish content is at least 80%, and it contains nothing but fish, water, and salt. Here we have a lot of undesireables:<br />- Gluten (bad for those allergic to it)<br />- Soy (can't remember what's wrong with soy, but there's some controversy, so I try to avoid)<br />- Vegetable oil (sounds innocent, but it's probably some garbage like highly processed corn or cottonseed or soy oil, or a mixture of them. These are bad oils. Search the net on ""vegetable oil"" to find out why exactly it's not a good thing).<br /><br />All in all, meh.

"I admit it up front:  I don't like spicy food or spicy drinks.  I hate pepper with a passion as well as other ""hot"" spices.  I will occasionally drink ginger ale and eat gingersnap cookies, so I thought that I might like this ginger/lemon beverage.  But it had far too much kick to the ginger to suit me.  Those who like ginger and don't mind the spicyness will probably like this.  I even tried it cooled as an iced drink (which I usually prefer) and still hated it.  To be fair, since I knew that I don't like really spicy food or drink, I gave it three stars.  And I think that if they would work on it and tone down the ginger, it could be a good beverage.  But not as it is right now; at least not for me.  Also, if they're going to sell it in America, they'll have to change the instructions to show how much water to add in cups instead of using ml.

"I'm always on the lookout for cereal that isn't too sweet, both for my husband and my children. And besides the usual suspects, it can be surprisingly difficult to find a tasty cereal that isn't loaded with sugar. So, when I saw this one, I thought we would give it a try (not being privy to the ingredient list beforehand).<br /><br />The flavor is really good - I don't find it overly sweet, and there is a definite overall nut flavor. It tastes delicious both with milk and straight out of the hand. It doesn't appear to get soggy overly fast, which is a huge criteria for me. My husband said he finds it a bit too sweet (he prefers Corn Flakes), and my daughter (who is 4) ate about 3 bites before asking for something else.<br /><br />However, what absolutely ensures that I will not be buying this cereal in the future, is the ingredient list. Out of the first 8 ingredients, 4 of them are a form of sugar. This is how it reads:<br /><br />""Milled corn, sugar, peanuts, honey, malt flavoring, molasses, salt, high fructose corn syrup....""<br /><br />I attempt to avoid HFCS whenever I can - I'm not of the ""it's completely evil"" mindset, but I believe that it's hard to have moderation when it is in absolutely EVERYTHING. And with 3 other kinds of sugars, where is the need? 11g of sugar in one 3/4 cup serving of cereal is far too much - both for me, and for my children. So, while I really enjoyed the flavor, once this box is gone there will be no repeat purchases.","Tasty, but too much sugar",3

"The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the ""chicken pot pie"" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out.

"I use a conical burr grinder to grind the beans. And  I've used the right temperature for my tastes. To get an idea f what that is, I find Starbucks STORE coffee to be on the bitter side.  Starbucks made at home is very good because I probably am using a slightly lower temperature than them. Depending on the bean, I vary the temperature and soak time just a little till I settle on what is best for me and for that bean. My favourite seems to be their house blend. I look for medium to dark roasts. These beans seem to be medium or a notch below perhaps. So with that background, I'd say these seemed ok to me. The first taste had me go ""Huh.. different. Not bad. But I'm not loving it yet"". I've finished the whole bag now and I can say I did get used to the slightly different taste. Pleasant. But not great IMO. And if it's your cup. Another thing I want to mention is that I had to use a greater quantity of beans to get it to taste ok. So for a single serve, I'd have to use an extra teaspoon of (unground) beans.

"I love everything I've ever tried from Newman's Own for myself and my favorite K-cup coffee is Newman's Own, so of course I just knew my treat loving dogs would love Newman's Own Dog Treats. Boy was I wrong. I had to go out for a few hours so gave each pooch a treat (the treats are rather large) and left. Normally the treats are swallowed so quickly I often wonder if they even taste them. But not these treats. After being away over 2 hours I came back to find both treats still there, still whole. So while I would give this product a 5 just knowing everything about it is the best - my pups give it a 1, hence the average of 3.<br />Both my pups are Maltese - 5 and 7 pounds and they may just be overly picky, but they are all I have to go by.",I say yes but my dogs said NO!,3

"Well, in another review I mentioned in passing that this brand's ""green tea and lemon"" is better, and I stand by that impression.  I've gone through about half of a case of this one, and even though it isn't any different from a calorie perspective, it just seems too sweet for my taste.  I'm sure there will be those that would love the extra sweetness, and in fact it's very much like sweetened tea with some vinegar essence added.  Overall, it's quite drinkable, and it's not a bad way to get started on a Kombucha habit.  It won't replace GT Dave's Kombucha, but to me it's better than some of the other brands floating around, and it's certainly better than no Kombucha at all.","Decent, but not as good as the lemon + green tea",3
"I considered the positive reviews posted when I ordered this product so I gave it a try as other people found it good. I eat quite a bit of smoked Mahi, Mullet, Salmon and kingfish from my local smoke house in So. Fla. and think that I have a decerning taste when it comes to ""good smoked fish"" but I'm sorry to say that this Alaska Smokehouse product is the nastiest foul smelling Salmon once taken out of the foil package that contains the nasty smelling juices that if by chance go down your kitchen sink drain your in for a treat to  remove the funk that will emit from your sink trap. The Salmon was very soft and mushy with just a slight hint of smoke. Couldnt tell if it was brined but by the way it just falls into little mushy globs I think it was a chemical wash. I would think that this is a production line product with very little ""by hand "" or human interaction combined with many short cuts taken. The box is nice to keep your fishing lures in but its made in China for cripes sake! I mean this product comes from the N.W. and they make the box in China?? Bottom line is DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on this product as you might as well go purchase a $3.00 can at your grocer and throw a couple drops of ""liquid smoke"" on it and you'd more than likely have a better product. I would have given this to my cat but was worried how he would digest it so rather than take the chance of a vet visit I bageed it in a few zip lock bags one inside the other as to seal in the disgusting meily smelly funk and put in a trash can down the street!",Not what you might expect,3

"After reading other reviews on this coffee, I was conviced I had to try it.  It's o.k., but really tastes much more like the cheaper WalMart brand coffee.  It doesn't even compare to Starbucks, not even close.  I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.  I'm gonna try roasting the beans a little more myself to see if that makes any difference. I've never done that, but at this point, with 4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans left, I have to try something to make them taste better..  If that works out, I'll post again, but I'm not holding out much hope.  If you want really great coffee, you should look elsewhere, Coffee Bean Direct is just not cutting it...Good luck.<br /><br />July 9th,2012:  Update.  Well, I tried ""roasting"" the beans a little more.  Took a small amount and put them in the toaster oven for 15 min. at 400 degree.  They smelled good, but tasted horrible.  So I'm using the beans as I bought them, and making due.  Still not the great coffee I had hoped for, but drinkable.  Someone wrote a review of these beans talking about how they had a ""chocolaty and vanilla"" flavor.  Way off base! Or, it was someone at coffeebeandirect.com with a phony review.  Not even close.  When I am finished struggling thru this five pound bag, NO MORE..!","OK, but will not order again",3

"I love peanut butter, and I bought this product in an effort to save some fat, while keeping the protein.  Truthfully, I don't think it's that great on its own... I mixed a little with water to make a peanut-butter-like paste, like it said, and ate it on whole-grain toast.  The flavor just isn't the same as regular peanut butter, and the texture was a little gritty.  For this, I'd rather just use a tablespoon of regular peanut butter - with such a small amount, it isn't much fat anyways.<br /><br />However, the PB2 powder is MUCH better in a protein shake or smoothie because it mixes with the other ingredients and provides that hint of peanut butter flavor.  I think it also might be alright if you made it in to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Either way, it is a great substitute for peanut butter, if you can get past the fact that it doesn't taste exactly the same.

"I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.

The flavors are not clear or intense and it is more like a not too sweet kool-aid than a margarita.  Now, I have to admit that I have strong preferences about margaritas and I prefer them strong and with nothing but tequila, cointreau and real lime juice.  The sweet mixes that are used to make so many margaritas sold in restaurants and bars are not my cup of tea (or margarita!).  For those many who do enjoy the restaurant variety margarita the Crystal Light Margarita Mocktail might be just their cup of tea.  It has the same flavor and if made into a slushy in the blender it would taste very like the frozen margaritas found in restaurants but without the calories.

"Let me tell you, I have drunk A LOT of water in my lifetime. I'm 41 years old, so you figure that's what? 3 glasses a day times 365 days times 41 years? That's almost a craptillion gallons of water.

I tested it against several other brands as well as tap water and water right from the hose. After several very carefully controlled taste comparisons, I'm prepared to conclude that Essentia 9.5pH Drinking Water (1.5 Liter) tastes *exactly* like water. The bottle is also made of plastic, which is awesome because you can hold on to it while drinking the water inside. The lid screws on and off. I would highly recommend this water to anyone who loves water. You could totally replace your current favorite water with this, and you would never know the difference. That's because Essentia knows what they're doing when it comes to bottling water. They bottle it, and they bottle it good.

When I placed the first cup in the machine and pulled the handle down, the machine started brewing, but nothing came out. I realized that the sides of the cup had bent and the bottom was not punched through, so no coffee could come out. Luckily I realized this before too long so I was able to keep the water and grinds from going all over.

"This flavor has a much more mild flavor than the Black Cherry flavor I reviewed earlier.  While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.

"As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.","Taste great, but jam up coffee maker",3

"Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it.  It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her.  She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re-invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy.  (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.)  It's a cute toy and a great concept - and she did enjoy it - however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem-solving as our westie seems to be.

"This snack is somewhere between a fig newton (filling on the inside), a granola bar (crunchy and easy to carry) and a cookie (sweeter than most granola bars).

Better tasting than a lot of other 'low calorie' snacks.<br /><br />the cons: Some artificial flavorings. Fairly heavily processed.

Bought a jar at World Market & read reviews here before I made it and glad I did. I sauteed some onion and garlic in addition to just chicken  & added sauce & some water as very thick & simmered for 15 minutes.  It is sweet but so is every chicken korma I've had so I liked that but it didn't have as much of creamy taste as I would like.  This could be fixed by adding coconut milk instead of water. I didn't hate it but won't buy again because had huge anise flavor (& I like anise) and it had a weird pickly tang...I put it over rice and ate with a lot of chutney so was OK but will either try to make myself next time or try another brand of sauce.

There is no question that Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from ginger. The smell and taste is strong. I would suggest you start off light and continue too add the mix until you reach the strength of flavor you desire. I could not imagine how strong a bite this drink would have if not cut with honey. I do agree that with the advertisement that this is a strong ginger drink with a unique taste. My first sip shocked my taste buds that I almost did not continue to drink any. I did continue too and as I started too adjust to the flavor. The drink was not bad and it still had the ginger bite I wanted but this is not a blend I would seek out. I would drink but never buy it. Though flavorful; I did not find the experience enjoyable. The crystals do instantly dissolve to make this spicy beverage. And with the taste...I hope it is good for you.,Ginger Drink with Bite,3
"I tried these cookies and my first impression was rather positive: it's soft, super-chocolate tasting and a nice indulgent snack. Then after just eating two I felt it was a bit much. The cookie really tasted almost too sweet to the point of making me feel rather sick after eating just a few.

In all, these cookies are just okay but could be improved upon.",Almost too sweet,3
"The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste.

And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness.

"Disclaimer: I have this on subscribe-and-save.<br /><br />I make yogurt with raw milk and this product, when I don't have any yogurt lying around it makes for a very tangy yogurt that is fairly runny.

Otherwise just use a dollop of an otherwise edible yogurt as a starter and chance the result.<br /><br />It does contain sucrose so if you're attempting to be paleo/primal you will need to weigh up whether that's acceptable or not.<br /><br />Bland and firm vs runny and tangy.

"Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over.

"They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water.

"Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.<br />6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.

"I'm not a regular customer of 'energy' products.  In the past I've ordered and reviewed another pre-made energy drink.  I have now fallen in love with Crystal Light's Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I opted to get this supplement/energy drink through Vine.  The price is reasonable.  One container holds a pretty large amount of servings.  Let me tell you WHY I only gave this product 3 stars:<br /><br />***The bottle is 'confusing':  Before anybody makes comments about my being illiterate or something equivalent to it, let me explain.  The manufacturer has you measure the serving size by placing lines  on the wrapper.  However there is NO WAY to see inside the container to determine if you've measured the correct amount.  This makes a user have to guess and add more, if needed, based on taste.  What they SHOULD have done is place a see-through section next to the lines so you can see where you need to stop.<br /><br />***The flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  I drank one cup of it and I think that will have been the only cup.  Granted, it has no calories or anything but flavoring.  I am able to drink Crystal Light with artificial sweetener and regular sodas with sugar or corn syrup.  Vitamin Squeeze, however, just didn't taste good.  Maybe it was because it has no sweetener in it and I tend to dislike drinks that fall in that category.  You, on the other hand, may enjoy unsweetened drinks.  If that's the case, you MAY like it.

"A simple meal is often welcome when your working life takes up a good portion of your day and Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger offers exactly that. It contains the basic ingredients in a box, ready to prep and serve with minimal effort or culinary skill. All you need is ground beef and water to create this food product and it can be served as a main dish or a side dish with other foods.<br /><br />Velveeta is the most popular processed cheese food in America and while I am not too fond of the taste of the actual cheese product, I have found the Velveeta meals a decent tasting food that makes for a reasonably easy meal. And this particular product is no exception. The cheese is fairly smooth and there is a decent amount of balance from the seasoning mix. I found it compatible to my palate, even though I readily admit it is nothing incredible.<br /><br />Nutritionally, Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger is fairly good. The base product, without meat, has a good amount of calcium and iron. But on the negative side, there is a good deal of sodium in this product and it definitely comes through in the taste, which is a little saltier than I prefer. Calories are not too bad, provided you can consume in moderation. A single box is intended to serve five people and if you can keep your portion down at that level, your waistline and heart shouldn't suffer.<br /><br />I like meals that are easy to prepare and Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger certainly fits in this category. There is little to do other than brown the ground beef, add water, stir, and wait. Taste- wise, the product is good, but not great and it doesn't come even close to the taste of a freshly made meat, pasta, and cheese casserole.

It's not as tasteful as the honey that is sold on grocery stores. This one is more thick and therefore makes it VERY hard to spread around your waffles or pancakes.<br /><br />I read many reviews stating that this honey is good for your health. Well ever since taking it, nothing really changed at all. I've had this honey for months and no significant health improvement of any kind has happen.<br /><br />I was mostly aiming at the skin issues that I have. I heard honey is recommended as a mask to kill bacteria on the skin that could cause blemishes. So with all of the health benefits that this honey was said to have, I trusted that it would not only improve my health but also help fight my acne. Well it sure didn't do a single thing to change my skin condition. Just hours of annoying thick honey on my face. No blemish was stopped, no quickness in fading away the red spots and absolutely no skin improvement of any kind. My skin didn't feel cleaner at all nor did it glow or changed a single thing. A simple soap sure left me more satisfy than putting this on my face day after day in hopes that it would help.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a good product if you are just using it as a substitute for sugar.

"Firstly, let me start by saying all three of my dogs love Chef Michael canned food.  So I was surprised that I didn't have a better result with CM dry food.<br /><br />This CM dry dog food looks appealing to the eye (my eye), with what looks like vegetables and 'jerky' meat bits, but there's something about the taste or the smell that doesn't appeal to two of my three dogs.  Admittedly, both those are somewhat fussy eaters.  I was able to coax one of these to eat the dry crunchy bits, but she refused to eat the softer 'meaty' parts paws down.  The third dog seems to enjoy all of it just fine, which is the reason for my 3-star (average) rating.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was that the bag was as large as an 8lb bag of dry kibble, but only half the weight.  I guess all those soft and fluffy meaty bits are to blame for that.<br /><br />Overall, it's hit and miss in our house.  3-average stars.","Three dogs: two didn't like it, one loved it",3

"I really thought I would love this salt;  I really tried to love this salt:  I am just not a big fan of this salt.  This salt puts the Sea in Sea Salt (more so than other sea salts) -and for me that equates to a C in flavor.  I really get an 'ocean aftertaste' that I do not care for.  Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food, but since I don't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me.  Another disappointment for me is the loss of crunchiness when this salt touches anything moist;  other salts seem to be able to hold onto their crunch a little better.  I will raise this review if I find a food that embraces this salt's uniqueness to my liking.",Puts The Sea in Sea Salt,3

"I wasn't sure what to expect from the name ""Newton Fruit Thins"" and the picture on the box. Given that fruit newtons slogans have been ""the cookie that thinks it's a fruit"" and ""a cookie is just a cookie, but a Fruit Newton is cookie and cake"", I had thought it might a sweet, crisp thin cookie, similar to a ginger thin.

"I thought that adding ginger to chicken soup was pleasantly tasty, but it was a bit bland. I wish this had more ginger flavor. If you dont have MSG, or more salt, you gotta add something. The vegetables were still pretty hard - I cooked it by adding boiling water and waiting 3 minutes. Also, there was a very small amount of pieces of vegetables. I think even one or two actual slices of mushroom would increase the perceived value greatly. The noodles reconstituted nicely, as they do with all versions of these soups, and there was a nice serving of them. I would have liked to see maybe even slightly less noodles if it meant more vegetables. An optional spice flavor packet would be really nice too.<br /><br />I didnt think this was bad but I wasnt that impressed. This would probably be improved with a little soy sauce or spice. I know they are trying to limit the salt but i've had other soups with 1000mg of sodium (the amount in this soup - they claim 2 servings but thats a joke and deceives many people) or less, and it tasted better. Also, when cooking, do not use more water then specified. 1 cup is enough; any more will substantially dilute the taste. I would recommend trying this once but after that, unless its $1.50 or less, I dont think its a repeat for me.<br /><br />I saw this at my local publix for - get this - a whopping $4.79. Its certainly NOT worth that price. With annie chun you are partly paying for the gimmick - the cornstarch recyclable packaging, charity donations, organic ingredients, no msg (although does contain yeast extract which has free glutimates I believe..), etc.<br /><br />My recommendation is to only pick this up if you see it on sale, and then add in something extra - maybe even more ginger. If you are able, some diced chicken would really improve this soup. If you are on the go, you could also add canned chicken breast since its shelf stable.

Since this is the first time that I have had dried pineapple, I cannot say if my disappointment is because of this particular brand or not.

I was also surprised that this dried fruit was less sweet-tasting than I expected, even though it is highly concentrated in sugar (as are all dried fruits).

The individual pieces can be separated easily.","Okay, but not nearly as good as whole fruit",3

"At the end of the day, it's just water.<br /><br />The label claims a lot of things such as a silky smooth taste, better hydration, the infusion of electrolytes, and the ""best available pH at 9.5"" which I really can't comment on as I didn't have any scientific equipment to test the pH level.<br /><br />I wish I could give you some flowery comments like you can with wine, such as having the ability to smell a hint of apricots, smoke, and charcoal while drinking this, but I can't.  I will tell you the water somehow tastes different (and better) really cold vs. room temperature.<br /><br />After trying this water myself and being unable to conjure up a ""wow"" factor, in order to see if there is a taste difference with this water I set up a ""Water Challenge"" similar to the old Pepsi Challenge with two of my co-workers as follows: I poured equal amounts of cold water in cups containing the Essentia water, water from a Walmart / Sam's-branded bottle of water, and water from the tap that had gone through a filtration device in the office.  The results were incredible - you couldn't tell a difference and the limited test subjects were unable to correctly identify the ""better"" water.  For clarification, the Walmart-branded bottle was first for one participant and tap water was first for the other.<br /><br />In other words, there is nothing wrong with this water.  However, if you look at the cost/benefit analysis of purchasing this water - including shipping from Amazon - the accountant in me just can't say I need to make sure I buy this in the future: it's way too pricey per ounce when, at the end of the day, there's probably nothing wrong with the water coming out of your tap if you have basic filtration on it.","At The End of the Day, It's Just Water in a Fancy Bottle",3

"The MiO Mango Peach Liquid Water Enhancer comes in 1.62 ounce cute-looking, small containers well-suited for portable use if you want to bring one or more of them along during an outing.  Each container is designed for ease of use -- flip the protective cap up, tip the container, then squeeze to let the MiO liquid come out.<br /><br />You do need to get an initial feel for how much of the MiO liquid to add to your water.  The suggested ""recipe"" is one squeeze per 8 fl ounce serving.  After some initial experimentations, I found this suggested recipe to be just right for me, and in my particular case, although I didn't detect an aftertaste, the sweet flavor I tasted didn't really taste like mango peach.<br /><br />I'm personally not too keen about this product's ingredients which, among other things, include propylene glycol, sucralose and acesulfame potassium (sweeteners) and various dyes for artificial colorings.

I've only had ALO aloe vera drinks before and I like that taste of them in general. Fruity tea like beverage with the aloe vera bits that make it all worthwhile.  This aloe vera drink in particular reminds me more of the sugar infused tea drinks like Lipton's Citrus Tea or Arizona Tea than something remotely healthy. I mena it's really sweet and I almost suggest watering it down a bit. Other than that it's not bad but I wouldn't drink it for any health benefits.,A little too sweet  but still fun to drink,3
"I actually bought this product at a local Smart and Final supermarket in my area (namely, Los Angeles and specifically in the Lincoln Heights community) and I'll be honest, it's not too bad for instant cappuccino. Now, I'm not a coffee snob or a coffee connoisseur but I have worked in coffee retail for 4 years previously (Seattle's Best Coffee at a local Borders Bookstore back in the days when Borders was still around [now defunct and its trademark and intellectual rights sold to Barnes and Noble]). Given that, I know a little something about coffee relative to the average coffee drinker.<br /><br />To clear out some misconceptions though, the only difference between a cappuccino, espresso, and a cup of coffee is the amount of water used and how finely or coarsely grounded the beans are. Otherwise, it's all just ""coffee."" Caffe D'Vita's cappuccino is more like ""coffee"" with a very heavy creamer and artificially-sweetened French Vanilla taste. No additional sweetener required. The French Vanilla taste is rather addicting, in my opinion. It makes you want to drink more of it at a time but the caffeine content is low so I wouldn't recommend it as your daily morning caffeinated drink.<br /><br />I use about 6 tablespoonfuls of it in a mug of roughly 10 ounces. Any less seems to give it a watery, milky taste that doesn't even taste like coffee. The bitterness is more pronounced with less tablespoons. Otherwise, it's not bad but not great for instant cappuccino. If you want something with more caffeine, I'd suggest looking at other instant cappuccino mixes than buying this one. I hope this was helpful.",Not bad but not great,3

"As a perpetual dieter, I'm always on the lookout for low calorie snacks that offer a taste that seems more ""sinful"" than it is. So presented with the chance to try Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, I was thrilled. After all, some of my favorite words -- ""fudge"" and ""caramel"" -- were in the name so it seemed to have promise. In addition, I'm a huge fan of Dale and Thomas Chocolate Chunk and Caramel Popcorn, though I can never really justify the calories. If this snack was even halfway as good as the Dale and Thomas, it would be a winner in my eyes.<br /><br />However, after eating a few bags, this snack reminded me of Cracker Jacks but without the peanuts. The fudge/chocolate taste is barely present. Although you can SEE the chocolate, it didn't really register in the mouth. The dominant taste is definitely caramel. To me, it tasted exactly like Cracker Jacks, which I happen to like but it wasn't the taste I was expecting. I was expecting chocolate and caramel and the chocolate taste didn't come through at all.<br /><br />Because I wanted some other opinions to share, I asked my husband, neighbors and our kids to try the snack too. Here is their feedback:<br /><br />From my husband who uses Weight Watchers: Texture is more like a rice cake than popcorn. Taste the caramel but not the chocolate. It ""costs"" 3 Weight Watchers Plus points and I wouldn't want to use that many points for this.<br /><br />From my female neighbor who also counts calories: Quite tasty but very sweet. Would like more of a salty taste for a snack like this. Taste the caramel but not the chocolate. Would prefer that it had 100 calories instead of 130; I'm used to expecting these types of snacks to be just 100 calories. Would like to see less sugar if I was going to give it to my kids for a snack. 18 grams of sugar seems like a lot for a snack like this.<br /><br />The kids: All the kids liked it and wanted more and said they would eat it as a snack.<br /><br />Everyone agreed that quantity in the bags was enough. I poured the bag out in my hand and got a full handful and then some. My neighbor said she wouldn't mind if they put less in the bag to get to that ""magic"" 100 calorie mark.<br /><br />In the end, the consensus was that the snack tasted good but tasted more like caramel popcorn, not fudge-drizzle caramel popcorn. The adults thought they would probably not buy it again. The kids said they would eat it, but both sets of parents thought there might be better snacks with less sugar in it. If you're a dieter who is looking for a sugary snack fix, this might do it for you but don't look for the fudge drizzle to show up in the flavor; it was missing in action in the bags we tasted. Think smaller pack of Cracker Jacks (minus the peanuts) and I think you have a good idea of what this snack tastes like.<br /><br />A Side Note: Both of the moms thought the packaging was very attractive and would make us buy it if we saw it in the grocery store.",Reminded Me Of Cracker Jacks More Than Anything,3
If the cookies had been edible I might have given more stars for this item. They were a bit fuzzy like the title says. And the smell was offending. They smelled of mold and crumbled. Besides you only get a handful and they are about quarter size or smaller. But the cups are awesome. I did not expect them to be so thick and heavy. The straw is also made of heavy acrylic. I am sure they will last if properly cared for. The only downer is they are so heavy they actually look like and feel like glass so I am not sure if they will break or crack if dropped.,Forget the cookies. The cups are awesome!,3

If I had bought this tea as a regular bag Earl Grey, like a Twinings Earl Grey, I'd give it 4 stars. But, since it advertises full leaf, I'm giving it only 2. In my opinion, it is similar in quality and taste to Twinings.<br /><br />I up'd my rating to 3 stars. It is one of the better bag Earl Grey teas that I have had.

"The beef steak tips with mash potatoes is on the lower end of the Hormel line. The gravy, for once, is surprisingly not too salty but I've always suspected that if you take the salt away, all that would be left is blandness and that is exactly what happened here. I also really wish Hormel would stay away from the mashed potatoes. Sliced potatoes is fine because they tend to have texture if not taste but mashed potatoes really don't add anything to their dishes besides something mushy and tasteless to quickly fill your stomach. And the tiny bits of meat in here try their best to overcome the mountain of mashed potatoes but unfortunately aren't up for the job. It's not that this one is bad, per say, but it's just one of those meals that blends into all the rest without ever being noticeable.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.",Not one of the better ones,3
"This flour works fine for certain things, depending on your taste preferences. It has a very strong aftertaste (kind of bitter/sour) because of the bean flour. Thus it is pretty strong in plain breads and rolls. If you don't mind that, then good for you! (My husband is pretty sensitive and can't tolerate the bean flour or taste very well.) I found it works better in cookies, chocolate or spice cakes, brownies, banana bread, and pizza dough. Because these baked goods are made with other strong flavors, they help mellow out the bean taste which can be pretty overpowering if you don't have something with which to temper it. I like the consistency of this flour better than the rice flour blend I've also been using but again, consider your taste preferences and what you'll be baking/cooking with it.",Works well for certain things...,3

"As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those ""duh"" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of ""treat.""  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it ""makes pills a treat to give!""<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger ""capsule"" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of ""It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet"" and ""It's a Cat's World...

"As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself.","Good idea for certain dogs/needs, but...",3

"I saw this brand of coffee listed as ""New"".  I wasn't sure if it was new to Amazon or a new product overall.  I've purchased a box and have another on it's way as I am very satisfied with the taste of the brew.  I am still on the first box that I've ordered.  I've owned my Keurig since December 2011 and have been through a large sum of K-Cups of various brands in my attempt to find my go-to-brand.  I was lookimg to contact the seller directly but since it's Amazon I was left to leave my comments here.  Now, as I've said the coffee tastes great, but not sure if it's a fluke thing as I've NEVER had this happen, but 2 of these K-Cups brewed grounds in the cup and I had another that was unable to have the hole puncture through it.

"For as long as I can remember, Mallomars have been in my family's home about this time of the year. I love the crunch of the cookie mixed with the soft, marshmallow type filling and that chocolate coating.

They just plain taste good--that is, as long as you open the box to find that you have fresh Mallomars inside.

"Once you've discovered the creatures these fruitily filled breaded concoctions attract, you'll line the lower decks of your three story house on the hill with at least 30 popped tarts.

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:41 Mins<br /><br /></span>I do not buy too many pre-packaged cookies and when I do it's usually OREO's or fig newtons. This new cookie from Nabisco, the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge sounded promising and looked pretty good on the package but the reality was a little different.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft. Soft and crumbly in fact. It is so soft that it literally breaks in to little pieces as soon as I pick it up and begin to eat it. I guess that's a good reason to pop the entire cookie into the mouth in one bite, since they are small enough to do just that. The ""representation"" of the cookie on the package shows the cookie much larger than it really is and as you can see by my video, the real cookied bears little resemblance to the picture of the cookie.<br /><br />As for taste and mouth feel... I did not care for it at all.<br /><br />At best, this is a barely OK pre-packaged cookie. However I would not buy these again. I'm being generous with a 2-star rating.

K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense!

"Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all.  There, I said it.  There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on.","A noble effort, but falls short",3

"It is always fun to get a gift box or basket but the Wine.com box needs a better presentation.<br /><br />This gift box includes small quantities of upscale food items. Included in the box are; Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt, a small jar of mustard, 2 squares of Ghirardelli chocolate, cocoa, cheese straws, wafer crackers, a small bag of chocolate chip cookies, a round of cheese wedges and a small knife. One concern I had was on the cheese. I was unable to track down the company that makes it to ask how long it could last without refrigeration. But I did call a rival cheese company who shared that if unopened some of their cheeses could last a year without refrigeration. So hopefully this is the same.<br /><br />It is really hard to judge the value of a gift basket or box. I have sent flowers that were quite pricey that lost their bloom in a week yet delighted the recipient. Just recently I sent a fruit gift, from a popular fruit company, which included 6-8 pears, 6-8 oranges and 6-8 apples. It was on special but still pricey at around $60. The person on the receiving end was thrilled. With gift baskets there is a tendency to pay much more than the actual value of the items included. And a lot of it has to with presentation. Giving a fruit basket for example, is more exciting than say handing a person a bag of apples from the grocery store with best wishes. And getting one can be so exciting.<br /><br />And that is where the Wine.com basket fails. For ease of transportation, the goodies are packaged in a cardboard box with nutmeg colored paper shavings. This is placed in a larger box to prevent any damage which is nice. However, the red wrap and gold bow are not on the box. It is just a plain cardboard box.<br /><br />The packaging is substantial and fine but it is just not exciting. And presentation means a lot when it comes to gift baskets.

"This product claims to add two things to water: flavor and an energy boost.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty good, sweet but not too sweet, like a punch made from all-natural juices.  Getting it just right is difficult, though, because of the inexact science of mixing it with the right amount of water.  The bottle says ""one squeeze per eight ounces,"" but a squeeze can be very short or very long, so it's hard to know how much to use.  The bottle says it contains 24 squeezes, but unless you want to measure 1/24th of the bottle with a measuring spoon or mix the whole bottle in with a gallon and a half of water right away and draw from that supply, that's no help.  I tended to err on the side of more rather than less; underestimating the squeeze produced a pretty watery flavor.<br /><br />As for energy, it didn't do much for me.  When it first came in the mail I immediately poured a glass of water and mixed it in while sitting around.  At that point I thought I felt a little energy boost; but when I would drink it during a workout, I found it was no more revitalizing than plain water.<br /><br />So call it two and a half stars: four stars for the flavor, one for the (lack of) energy boost.",It's Okay,3

"I have purchased this product due to its amazing reviews.  I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating.",I am not sure if it has helped me,3
"As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those ""duh"" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of ""treat.""  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it ""makes pills a treat to give!""<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger ""capsule"" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of ""It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet"" and ""It's a Cat's World...

"We received Hartz Crunch 'n Clean biscuits through the Vine program, and our medium-sized dog can go through a large-sized biscuit in about a minute.  She enjoys them, but I'm concerned about the patented ingredient, DentaShield.  ""Invented by researchers at Indiana University's School of Dentistry, the same researchers who developed flouride for you and me,"" DentaShield might be the sodium hexametaphosphate listed as the 5th ingredient after wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, and wheat germ meal.  It sounds like a salt, which isn't necessary to clean tartar from teeth, as the box claims.  Other ways are better to clean dogs' teeth.<br /><br />These biscuits are definitely loaded with non-essential ingredients like partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and artificial color (they're uniformly tan, so where's the color?).  The blurb about the same researchers who developed fluoride set off warning bells, as many people know the issues with mass amounts of fluoride in our drinking water, but people unfamiliar with those issues may feel this is a good advertising tactic.<br /><br />Our dog likes them, but dogs tend to like junk food, including human food.

"I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild.

Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience.

"These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.","A healthy alternative, but with overpowering and inconsistent flavor",3

"Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

The cheerios has 1 gram more fiber and none of the bad fat that the PPCC has but I feel like, given the trade-off of weaker peanut butter flavor, the increase in healthiness is very marginal.

"EDIT: April 2011<br /><br />Despite my previous statement, these are no longer the best baked low fat snack ever. Not anymore. Sadly, they changed the ingredients. They added rice, took away certain seasonings, and added a DISGUSTING tasting ACID. It tastes like im eating a LEMON. This tastes like a completely different snack - I dont buy it anymore. WHY OH WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE RECIPE. GOD HELP US.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />These krinkle sticks are the best baked low fat snack EVER. NO QUESTION. They have a great crunch and a HUGE SERVING SIZE!!!! You would have no idea they are so low in fat! They are seasoned to perfection. Sometimes the seasoning can settle to the bottom a bit and the sticks near the bottom are seasoned more (MORE FLAVOR NOM NOM NOM NOM).

"I love chamomile and being sensitive to caffeine its the perfect tea for me. This is my review on  Tazo Calm vs Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus.

They're both not organic so the price makes a big difference, I definately recommend the Tazo Calm over Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus.",Mighty vs Tazo,3

"Someone said that it tasted like a Sprite. No it doesn't to me. Not even close in my opinion. It's a Energy Drink. It tastes more like Redbull but with a less tart flavor. I couldn't taste any after taste so that was a plus. Even if it does have Splenda in it, I don't even taste that and I don't like Splenda. It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup.

"""You expect me to eat this slog?"" Jerry slammed down his sandwich, which, in his meaty claws, had been pressed into a mound of bread shards and ham chunks. He picked a leaf of lettuce from the shrapnel that was once, only a few moments ago, a well-made sandwich, one created out of love. ""And what'd I tell you about lettuce? I don't want to see this on any more of my sandwiches!"" He took off his glasses and wiped his brow, falling back onto the stool at the kitchen counter.<br /><br />I don't know for how long I stood there, my mouth agape, my fingers clenched around the Tupperware bowl of sliced ham, my knees shaking. I'd never seen my son so angry.<br /><br />He opened his coloring book and searched his crayon box for the right color. ""Just once"" he said, feverishly putting a green crayon to work on a page, ""I'd like a sandwich that isn't so... so stinking plain."" He glared at me a moment before searching for a new color.<br /><br />I was frozen. I had failed, again, to find a satisfactory sandwich for my son. As I returned the tub of ham to its place in the refrigerator, I saw the bottle of Kraft Chipotle Mayo behind a box of Capri Sun juice squeezes. Why hadn't I remembered this? And it hit me: I had not purchased the Kraft Chipotle Mayo, my husband had. He mentioned purchasing it the previous night, after we had made love. He said he picked up the mayonnaise for lunch that day. ""It was the highlight of my day -- easily,"" he said, before rolling over to set his alarm clock.<br /><br />Inspired, I grabbed the Kraft Chipotle Mayo from the refrigerator. I snatched my son's plate. ""Hey!"" he said. But I didn't hear, my hands, my mind, raced, turning a mound of crinkly bread and shredded ham into a manageable sandwich. ""I told you, I'm not eating--""<br /><br />""Shut your mouth, my son!"" I commanded him, feeling a twang of guilt as he retreated to the comfort of his coloring book and crayons.<br /><br />New bread, new ham, mixed with the old. And then, the finishing touch, a glob of Kraft Chipotle Mayo. Peeling off the last remnants of lettuce, I slid the plate under my son's face. Unsure of what had just happened, he stared at the new sandwich a moment before putting his chubby little fingers around its edges and heaving it into his eager mouth. The smile that came over him assured me of one thing: Kraft Chipotle Mayo is pretty tasty. You should buy some!","My husband... He -- He, uh, likes it fine",3
"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.

"I have tried enough natural type bars to fill a health food store and without a doubt this is one of the best all around bars, but it is far from perfect. Great taste, but they melt easily during a hot spell or while travelling. But here's the real problem: First the bar uses non-GMO soy isolate (!!!!) as a protein source which many experts believe will alter your hormones profile by lowering testosterone and raising estrogen . . . exactly what a fitness enthusiast or person seeking longevity would not want. It also contains licorice which is on the possible list of supplements that can lower T. Even though the bar has an alkaline ph you might experience heartburn due to the soy isolate. Is it possible the licorice was added to combat the GERD/heartburn as well as enhance the taste? Perhaps, but at what cost?<br /><br />On the positive side I'm not sure I could name a better bar or better tasting bar overall, and again I've tried them all. Most taste terrible or are loaded up with fake sugars like Stevia (billed as being healthy) which a lot of people just can't digest very well.","Maybe the best bar out there, but not perfect for athletes!",3

"Within a month or two I had counted about 60 lil catnip plants growing.  But, the instructions suck.  This was my first time growing anything before.  I had to look up on the internet why my catnip plants started to not do so well. I learned that they were growing long and spindly from not getting enough sun.  And that I was watering them wrong with too much water at a time.  Plus I waited waay too long to replant and separate them.<br /><br />This is kind of a ripoff.  What you get is around 70-80 seeds and a tiny cup of dirt.  Looking on amazon, I could buy 400 catnip seeds for around $2-3, a bag of potting soil for $3 and a small pot, but larger than the cup, for a buck.","Plants grow fine, but kind of a ripoff",3

I tried toasting it, butter, low fat cream cheese and no dice. It feels like choking down forty saltine crackers.

"I have two Norwegian Elkhounds, one 6 years old and one 6 months old, and a 10 year old cocker spaniel. I am always looking for new treats to use as rewards for them. So, I took up the chance to give these a try.<br /><br />First thing I noticed, is that these treats come in a almost ""health food/gourmet"" type bag leading one to believe that they are an all natural healthy treat. After reading the ingredients they are just like most other treats on the market. There is absolutely nothing special about them. That's ok, dogs like treats.<br /><br />Second the individual treats are fairly large. Even my adult Elkhound who is 50 pounds, I would never give her a full sized treat from this bag. For the ingredients they are just too big.<br /><br />Third, the packaging is made to make it look like the box is plumb full of treats. When in actuality there are not that many treats in the bag at all. But, keep in mind that each treat should realistically be broken up into 3-4 pieces at a minimum.<br /><br />Did the dogs like them? Sure they did, there was no messy ""side effects"" after digestion so that's always a plus. But, at the end of the day the size of the treats, how few there really are, and the ingredients just make this a very average treat. Nothing special here.",Just average,3

"I got this Keurig for my mom as a christmas gift. I picked it initially because it was one of the more affordable, nicer ones. From what I can see its, great! it makes coffee almost instantly. The only thing I noticed is this Keurig is made cheaper than the more expensive ones, for example I own the 179.99 Keurig and the handle and base are made out of metal while this one's handle and base are made out of plastic. Its not necessarily a bad thing its just something I noticed. And its kind of unfortunate that it only allows you to choose two sizes of coffee and thats it. Basically what i'm trying to say is for someone like me whose a mild coffee drinker its great! But for someone who drinks coffee more often you might want to spring for one of the more expensive ones that allow you to be specific on different settings such as cup size and temperature.",Good for the Basic Coffee Drinkers,3

"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",Unremarkable,3
"OK, I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to granola type products because a local bakery makes a great blend and my wife makes cookie sheet after cookie sheet of the best granola ever.  This Kind Healthy Grains, though, is no slouch.  The ingredients are high quality, generally whole, and vegan.  It's a nice snack, in small amounts.  Still, I was a bit disappointed in the taste and texture.  The blueberry flavor was too muted.  The added sweeteners overwhelmed the natural flavor of the grains and berries.  Vanilla was in there somewhere but its flavor, along with the flavors of all the other ingredients, lost their individual taste profiles.  The resulting melange is tasty but does not have that crunchy, whole grain flavor I was expecting.",Tasty with good ingredients but missing something...,3
"I'm not a granola expert of fanatic, but I thought I might enjoy this product more because I like blueberry and vanilla.<br /><br />When I opened it, it smelled musty, like a year-old box of cereal.  I found that very odd, but plunged ahead anyway.  It was disappointing, because I picked up on pretty much no blueberry flavor (or blueberries, for that matter).  It tasted like really dense granola.  From a pure flavor and eating enjoyment aspect, I did not really care for it.<br /><br />From a health standpoint, this product is free of everything ""bad"" and full of ""good stuff""...heavy on flax.  I'm not a health food fanatic, so again, this was lost on me.  But my son, age 24, really seemed to enjoy it.  He's much more attentive to what he consumes, and I think he liked the taste as well.  He ended up being the only consumer of this product.  (My wife liked it less than me.)<br /><br />I have to conclude, based on the non-scientific study of my family, that this product appeals to folks accustomed to more ""healthy"" snack foods...and not folks like me who have no problem with more ""commercial, processed"" snacks.  I had hoped that KIND would be both tasty and healthy...but it fell short.  I'd be a two-star reviewer...my son would be 4...so I'm splitting the difference.",Not my favorite,3

"It's a shame to see this product get so many poor reviews, but it is due to the terrible labeling and the complete and utter lack of instructions on both the product and on the Unilever website at the time of this writing.<br /><br />Hair is classified on a scale of 1 to 4.  You can have several types of hair on your head.  Type 1 is straight hair.  Type 2a is wavy, and can be straightened and curled easily.  Type 2b is wavy, prone to frizziness, and hard to straighten.  I have a combination of type 2a and 2b, and when I was younger, had type 3a/b. This was way too greasy for my scalp and hair.<br /><br />Type 3a/b hair gets curlier and wavier as it gets longer, and is not as shiny as type 1 or 2.  Type 4a/b/c hair is often referred to as ""natural"" or ""African"" hair, and it is actually the most delicate of all hair types, thereby requiring a lot of care, plus appropriate use of moisturizing products.  That's what this Balm is for, type 4 hair, maybe some very dry type 3s, and if you read the five star reviews, you will see that folks with this kind of hair love it and know how to use the product.<br /><br />So, I am giving this three stars because it is not a good product as marketed, namely, without guidance or instructions.  It may be a good product if you have the right kind of hair, and in that case, you should give it a try.","Made for African or Polynesian-type hair - 4a/b/c, maybe 3a/b",3

"I've gotten a number of different Roland Olive products and they are restaurant quality, good value for the money.  Actually, the same is probably true for the Greek Country style.  I wasn't sure exactly what to expect but the price was pretty attractive.  At least to Roland, Greek Country means the blend of olives includes a bunch of tiny sticks/branches and 'Greek' seasoning which wasn't spared in the least.  I hate picking the stems & branches off and out of the pitted olives - and the spices both overwhelm (IMHO) the natural flavor of the olives and leave a aftertaste in my mouth.  I like the blend of different sizes and types of ripe and unripe olives - and that it's pitted.  I'd suggest getting this along with a container of Roland Kalamata Olives.  You can save the liquid from the Kalamata container - then do a quick wash and shake of the Greek Country Olives then drop them in the Kalamata liquid.  This will remove most of the 'extra' branch material - and in a week or so - the 'over' seasoning will mellow out quite a bit.  If you're good with the intensity of the Greek Spicing, you could probably just wash and shake the olives & container and filter the liquid to remove just the stem materials.",Be Sure You Know What Greek Country 'Style' Means,3
Let's see... Before ordering this toasted rice green tea from Numi I had ordered toasted rice green tea from Tea Attic.

"This maple syrup tastes like you'd expect this sort of syrup to taste like; thick, sugary, and typical of what you'd get at any fast food place. The real problem here is the packaging: out of the 80 cups that were shipped to me, about 20 of them had cracks in the container and a large amount of syrup had spilled out in the packaging. The plastic of the package seems fragile and in colder weather seems likely to snap or crack. I have amazon prime, so this was only en route to us for about two days and was delivered right to my office, so it wasn't as if we left it out in the cold for very long.

"Healthy catfood is really important to me; I've got one cat that has wheat/corn sensitivities and another that's just super high energy and needs food to match.

"We never buy pre-ground coffee, let alone flavored varieties. We do like chocolate so I figured this might be interesting.<br /><br />We brewed it in a drip coffeemaker using the recommended quantities of water and coffee, and the result was pretty surprising. We liked the pairing of the two flavors and how smooth the brew was (was not very acid at all).<br /><br />The one negative thing that we noticed was there was a ""flavored coffee aftertaste"" that seems to be the same no matter what flavor coffee it is.<br /><br />This is artificially flavored coffee (no chocolate) and the chemicals that they use to concoct the different flavors probably share the same base component(s), and that's what you taste afterwards.

"I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these ""MINI WHITE ROUNDS"" and an equivalent order of ""TATO SKINS"".  The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!

"This order reached me quickly.<br /><br />I opened up the box to see two packages of the box in the same package. In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.<br /><br />Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.<br /><br />Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good.

"I've never had canned salmon with no salt added before.  It is not bad, but it is different.  You can definitely taste the salmon, but in truth, I've had canned salmon numerous times before that had salt in it and it tasted like salmon, too.  The drawback on this particular canned salmon is that it does look like cat food.  If you remove the bones, any large pieces of fish are now in much smaller pieces.  This may work for you, but it isn't exactly what I've become used to with skinless and boneless versions.  The really strong argument for this product is that this is wild-caught Alaskan salmon at a good price.  Plus, if you need a no salt added version or the ability to control the level of salt with self-seasoning, this will definitely work.<br /><br />I have considered buying the skinless and boneless version that Crown Prince puts out, but I have some reservations.  First off is the cost.  You pay more for cans that weigh less (though, maybe the 1.5 ounce weight difference is negated if you remove the bones and skin?).  Second, one reviewer said that the first can was so salty that the remaining eleven cans were going to be donated.  That is a pretty negative reaction, but three other reviewers gave the skinless and boneless version a full five stars.  Finally, the omega-3 seems to be less in the skinless and boneless version, too.  1.5g in the no salt version compared to 0.235g in the skinless and boneless version.  Though, if you end up picking out the skin and bones, doesn't that lower the omega-3 you are consuming?  So, perhaps that is a wash, too.  I guess I'm still not sure.  I may end up going to the skinless and boneless version, but for now, I'll keep up with this one when it comes to my Subscribe & Save.",Good Flavor & No Salt...Center Spine Section w/Skin & Bones,3

This sprounter jar was a little expensive for just being a plastic lid and glass canning jar.  The lid will be great for not rusting but the holes are small enough that the water was slow to go in for rinsing.  I don't want to have to take off the lid to rinse twice daily. I keep 5-7 jars going all the time in different stages of sprouting so I have at least one jar of sprouts ready to eat each day so I need to be fast at rinsing. I always sprout alfalfa seeds so could easily use larger holes anyway. I did get these Jars in a very short time after ordering so that was nice.

In this, I have discovered, I, (or make that, ""we""), have true ""preppy"" tastes, (even though I did attend plain old Queens College in NYC -- part of the very public<br />City University of New York where, it seems, (to me, at least), egalitarian has gone from good to exremes -- and even fraternities and sororities are officially outlawed!  To some, this may seem only ""fair"" and ""equitable"".  But to status-seeking me, it seems SO unglamourous!  I guess I'm not the typical Queens College of the City University of New York student, though I do sincerely laud them for making eduction more available for everyone.  I only wish they had more of what private universities have.  To me, ""equality"" is equal luxuries for all, not equal utilitarianism for all.  Same goal, different methods, I guess....)  In ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", it states that preppies like filets...no bones to slice through, or fat to trim away. (Why waste the time, why spend the effort?)  The same has to go, (at least for me --and others with ""preppy"" tastes), for these otherwise ""gourmet"" quality confections.  Those little bits of chopped hazelnuts in the coating -- not to mention the BIG hazelnut in the centre -- make eating DIFFICULT, and spoil the pleasure of eating. Rather than have a (fancy) chocolate that I must chew through, I would prefer a plain old Hershey choclate bar. It, like the more expensive Nutella, IS a chocolate ""filet"".  I suppose this liking of the ""ordinary"" Hershey bar, (and a plain one please -- not one with almonds),  proves I am NOT a snob -- I, (and others like me), simply have TASTE!<br /><br />I thought I was alone in this.  But since reading ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", I know that others -- far richer than myself -- also have these tastes.  This, of course, vindicates me, and I feel glad of it.<br />Enjoy ""Ferrero Rocher Hazelnut Chocolates 48 Count Gift Box"" if you wish...and give it to friends, if that is your desire. But this sort of chocolate, because of the way it is formed, is NOT my choice for either myself or my friends.  And, no matter how excellent the chocolate itself is, it will NEVER be of ""gourmet"" quality, to me!",T O O......C H U N K Y......A N D.....C R U N C H Y,3

"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",Flavored Commercial Tea,3
"I wake up at 4:30 am every day to workout and get things done around the house. I work full-time and do weight loss counseling during my lunch on top of it.<br /><br />Enough said on why I need energy, right?<br /><br />I actually hate the canned energy drinks because, although they worked, my heart raced and I crashed hard a few hours later and you could hardly wake me from a nap.<br /><br />Enter FRS.  I actually prefer to liquid concentrated version, to be honest. But these are good for when I travel or when I'm on the go since you have to refrigerate the concentrate.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Works like crazy. There is a reason Lance Armstrong uses this stuff. That's not a plug, I don't work for FRS. But I do live in Austin with L.A.

No bad side effects<br />Provides all natural energy from quercetin and high antioxidants<br />Quercetin is currently being studied by the FDA as a treatment for obesity. No results yet, but preliminary use of quercetin resulted in weight loss in many of its users which put it in the testing. (Google it...it's too long for me go into.) I shouldn't say you'll lose weight from it because of that...I have no clue. I swear it helps me but it could be coincidence that I have more energy which results in doing more, which results in weight loss. Who knows.<br />I know I need to drink it, but I hate water. I don't use a full packet of this in my water so that I get more ""water"" in my ratio, but it flavors it well so I suck it down.<br />I love the berry taste.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />This doesn't dissolve as well as other water flavorings. It often sticks to the side of my water bottle, or the bottom. Also, it can clump which means I'll suck in a tiny glob of it--this wouldn't be a problem if it were something like hot cocoa mix but the stuff has lots of vitamins in it so you suck in a clump and you get a tangy vitiman aftertaste<br />It's too expensive in my opinion for water powder. But I still buy it. It sucked me in.<br />I think the liquid concentrate is actually more potent but this works in a pinch when I'm on the go or to flavor my water since I am not a fan of water and flavorings are the only way I'll drink it.<br /><br />Conclusion: If they had competition on an all-natural Quercetin-full powdered drink mix, I'd shop it in hopes for better dissolving and a lower price...til then, I just use it sparingly and I use the FRS liquid low calorie concentrate as my ""go to"" healthy energizer every day (especially in the morn and prior to any workout).  I have that on automatic ordering through Amazon so it's actually 50% less than if I order it directly through FRS (I think the FRS site it a tad of a rip off for a few reasons) since it's 15% off that way and there is no shipping costs...that stuff is heavy if you order lots of bottles so it's worth it.",High Cost but High Energy...the good and the bad,3

"As for the Green Mountain K-cup.  These k-cups do not give you the flavor you would normally get from brewing Green Mountain coffee.  The k-cups are week and taste watered down compared to brewing the loose/ground coffee in a conventional way, thus my 3 star rating.  With that said:  These k-cups are slightly better than other k-cups on the market.  If you are going to use k-cups I would recommend this brand and brew.  I would also recommend buying at Amazon as the prices are right compared to other sites.<br /><br />This k-cup is over priced.  If you look at the price you pay for this k-cup compared to the loose ground/whole beans you would be surprised.  You pay $0.50 a cup for a k-cup and $0.05 a cup for loose.  You get a 100 x's better cup from loose then with a k-cup.  Why pay more for a crappy cup?  Convenience!  But there are ways to avoid that cost<br /><br />The environment.  By using the loose/ground and the k-filter you help save the environment as all you toss out is ground coffee.  Every k-cup used takes up space in a landfill somewhere.  In my opinion it is the same as using a foam cup as to a ceramic mug to drink your coffee.<br /><br />Keurig.  This machine is convenient and quick.  But it is expensive to use with the k-cups, costing the average family $50+ a month.  To cut this cost to as low as $10 I use the k-filter with the machine and Green Mountain is one of my brands.  The loose/ground coffee in the filter gives you a stronger cup but still not the greatest but better than the k-cup alone by far.  Using the Keurig you must make a choice to sacrifice quality over conveinance.  I make that sacrifice during the week as I have little time on the weekday's to brew a pot of coffee. But I choose to use the filter with the Green Mountain loose/ground coffee and get a slightly better cup and save about $40.00 a month.",Better than average for cheap k-cup standard of coffee,3

"I was diagnosed with Celiac less than two months ago, so I have been without chocoalte chip cookies for a little while.  I was craving them and these were on the grocery shelf (with 'mainstream' baking mixes...hurray for Betty Crocker putting itself out there with gluten-free products!)next to the brownies etc.,  I wish I had eaten more when they were warm.  They don't hold up for long after they have cooled down and you let them sit.  A good idea would be to use only enough dough for the cookies you can eat right away and freeze the rest; then use the rest as you would like to satisfy a craving of your own.  They should be eaten while still warm....when they are at their best.  After they cooled down; the slightly overly sweetness comes through.

"So, we had researched the benefits of living a more alkalized lifestyle, and had looked into Alkalized water or water with a high pH level.<br /><br />We thought we'd try this water instead of getting an expensive machine that could raise the pH of your water for you.<br /><br />Hoping that the water would be beneficial to my wife's health with RA, we had her try it for a few days as pretty much the main source of water that she drank.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she started to not feel good. Light-headed, and just not right. So she stopped drinking the water and felt better.<br /><br />We had high hopes for the water. We tested the pH with pH strips, but it doesn't come out right in the results as Essentia states you need a special machine to test the pH when the pH is so high.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there wasn't much information that Essentia could offer about the health benefits of using water with a high pH. So, we were disappointed.<br /><br />We read elsewhere that using a high pH water could be good in the short term, but not necessarily in the long term.<br /><br />So do your research to see if it's what you want, and then go easy on it when starting to use it and monitor how you do as you might not feel great after using it as was the case with my wife.<br /><br />I tested it.

The good thing is that you'll go through this coffee twice as quickly, so as long as you brew regularly...you'll use it up relatively quickly.<br /><br />The taste is on the bitter side, so I have been compensating with cream and more stevia than I usually use with my coffee.

It certainly isn't dishwater as the one and two star reviews for this product indicate, it IS better than that.  I was disappointed that this didn't live up to the four and five star reviews.  This certainly does not hold up to the taste and quality of beans that I have gotten from Dunkin' Donuts although since DD runs about $6 per pound and this ran about that for 2 1/4 pounds, it seems like a good deal.

"This is a smoky, creamy, and just very mildly spicy sauce.  If that's what you're looking for you'd likely enjoy it a lot, but for me, it made figuring out just what to do with it a little difficult.  Typically when I make tacos, etc, I just use salsa, sour cream, and sometimes hot sauce, so I'm struggling a bit to figure out where this fits in exactly.  It tastes good, but seems almost unnecessary.<br /><br />One use that seems to work pretty well is adding it to a taco salad.  It's kind of a nice addition to keep the flavors a bit more interesting and I might keep some around for that.  It could also add a bit of variety to sandwiches if one is in the mood for something a little different than the norm; perhaps on a southwest style Panini or similar.  I might also try it for dipping chicken nuggets or wings, etc.<br /><br />Overall it seems like a pretty good product, but not something I'd be likely to use daily or even a couple times a week, so I may pick up a bottle every now and then but I probably won't buy a 6-pack of them.  I would rate it perhaps 4 stars on taste but it loses a few points for versatility since it's not really hot sauce, taco sauce, salsa, sandwich spread, or salad dressing, it's kind of something else that I have trouble classifying.","Pretty good, but not sure what to do with it yet",3

If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.

I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.,Good taste but secretly  DECAF,3
They have a funky flavour and really get all over you fingers. I bought these to eat while driving it it isn't going to work.,Just OK,3
"I love the Soda Stream unit, but the syrups need some tweaks.  It is too sweet, so I use half the amount required; this is good if you want the product to last longer; this is bad because they use Splenda added to all their recipes, not just the diet.  If they would just use plain old sugar, I'd be much happier with this product.","Good idea, needs some tweaks...",3
"Sorry, but I will not order from this company again.  I ordered the product 2 November and received 13 November.  That's a bit long for a food item in my opinion.  Could have sworn it said 3-5 business days during checkout.  Every company is different and of course Penguin Mints cannot control the mail, but this time span just doesn't work for me.  The company can add their comments if they like, but that doesn't change the fact that I am unsatisfied with my experience.  I order from and through amazon.com once a month or so for the past 2yrs, and in my experience, it takes 7 calendar days or less to receive my products.  Besides, I've had better quality of the same product from a different company.  I tried Penguin Mints because they were cheaper.",Fool me once,3

"My family drinks a lot of coconut milk (about a can a day) and we have tried almost every brand out there.  This one tastes OK, but contains more preservatives than any other we have tried.  Unfortunately the ingredients are not listed here so I wasn't able to find that out until after my case arrived.<br /><br />For the price this Roland brand isn't a bad deal but I would recommend Chaokoh or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVIEG"">Natural Value Coconut Milk, 14-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> over this one.  Natural Value has no fillers or preservatives and tastes great which means it is perfect for making healthy coconut yogurt with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SUHY"">Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker</a>.  If you haven't tried making coconut yogurt yet I highly recommend it!<br /><br />A lot of people are still under the impression that Coconut milk is bad for you.  There was some faulty research done years ago on hydrogenated coconut oil which is mostly to blame for this.

"I love Brazil nuts. If given the option, I would choose them over any other nut (Macadamia nuts are a very close second)<br />So, I was very excited to receive this shipment. But, I am disappointed.

"This is by far, the best formula out there. The fact that is uses brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup is a major plus in my book. This company is diligent about manufacturing a quality, safe product for infants and I applaud that. Sadly, b/c of the rice component, it made my 6 month old extremely constipated and gassy, despite only having one bottle a day (all the other feedings were still BF). I can only imagine how bad it could've become if she was eating this formula exclusively. Disappointed with our personal outcome, but all babies are different so hopefully others will have better luck with it.","Best organic formula, too bad about constipation",3

"I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!",Love the product but cheaper at BRU,3

"I ordered this because I wanted to support the monistary, and the photo showed a substantial fruitcake size.  I was so tiny I was really appalled!  For $15.00, it was definitley not worth it, due to the miniscule size.  It was about 3"" X 3"", and the photo did not show how very tiny it was.<br />It was well made, very moist, wonderfully delicious, but way over priced for the very tiny amount of cake delivered.  I was frankly shocked that clergy and people who supposedly are honest and God fearing would do such a scam.",-hmmmm,3
"I tried this as I have found other flavors of the product to be wonderful.  Boy, was I disappointed!  It was so grossly sweet that I can't even bear the thought of trying to finish it.  I like sweet drinks, such as Mickey D's sweet tea, but at least that kind has the bitterness of the tea to balance the cloying sugar.  Perhaps if they had added a slightly bitter undertone to it, it would have tasted better.",A big disappointment,3

"Packaging on these leaves something to be desired - last shipment I received had 2 out of 3 boxes with the corners crushed and when I opened the first one and removed the bag, there were a lot of broken biscotti.  I expect it will be the same for the other box that was damaged.  Given that these are fairly fragile, they should be given better protection from being crushed by the shippers.<br /><br />The biscotti themselves are tasty, if a bit small.  I wish they were full-sized, 3 or 4 inches long instead of an inch and a half.  But as I live in a rural area where people think ""biscotti"" is a kind of biscuit, these are a good second choice.","Small, but good.  Poor packaging.",3

They didn't like them at all and refused to even put them in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />These fruit snacks are healthy, but not tasty.",not as good as expected,3
"Turns out I'm as susceptible to guilt as any other cat parent. I tried to switch my kitty over to super premium food - gradually as is recommended. Which is why it snuck up on me that this food was going to turn out to be a problem. While it was mixed with her old food she was tolerating it fine. She liked it by itself and had no trouble with it for the first few days. Then her poops starting turning really loose and she wouldn't touch it anymore. I tried transitioning onto two more super premium foods with the same results before I realized what the culprit was: one ingredient, flaxseed. All of the foods she had trouble with had it. The one super premium I finally found that she didn't have trouble with didn't have it. Flaxseed is known for greasing the chute so if your cat doesn't have problems in that area that ingredient might not be for you. It's amazing how many super premium brands have that ingredient prominently featured, which means I can't use them. Pity, as otherwise this food is very appealing: texture is dense but soft, the smell reminds me of Campbell's Condensed Chicken Soup (not unappealing for some of us) and the cat obviously liked the flavor before the inevitable reaction overcame it. Ah well, win some lose some. I'm keeping the rest of the carton as an alternate food since she doesn't have problems with it short term, only long term.",Limited Tolerance,3
Sound is very poor not expected with MI,Just okay,3
"If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.",Quick and apparently yummy toy,3

"My wife and I used to live in the San Francisco Bay Area and we loved this coffee, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf French Roast blend.  When I spotted this coffee on Amazon for use in the Keurig brewer I immediately ordered it in some quantity based on our past experience.  I was surprised to discover that the coffee is not contained within a K-Cup container but rather it is contained in a coffee filter like material with a top which fits into the K-Cup receptacle of the brewer.  Our family results are mixed.  My wife likes this coffee and drinks it a few times each day.  My experience was that the coffee flavor is still good but the hot water passes through the coffee and filter paper too quickly which produces a watered-down coffee flavor.  I wish the San Francisco Bay Coffee company would get the necessary licenses to put their coffee into actual K-Cup pods.  If the price was competitive, my wife and I would be steady customers.  But for my tastes, I'll stick with the Green Mountain dark roast decaf coffees which have a richer coffee flavor.",OK but suffers from lack of K-Cup form factor,3

"The first batch of this I purchased about a year ago was great.  Complex, good presence, all around great oolong (darker style ti kwan yin, not the greener variety available through other makers).  The second batch I bought a few months back was subdued, by comparison.  I'm guessing my second batch was fairly old.  Bummer, cause I really liked the first batch and will now be hesitant to risk another purchase.  BTW, I have purchased several Tao of Tea oolongs through amazon and this was the only one worth purchasing.

"I bought this dog food after the ""Tainted Dog Food"" incident this year.  I did some research to look for an alternative for my sensitive and allergic labracollie, and liked that Addiction used free-range animals and seemed to use natural ingredients.  My dog loved the taste and dug right into it.<br /><br />I had her on this diet for almost two weeks.  I bought two bags at a local mom and pop pet store, but it did not particularly improve her stool--which is a big factor for me and her digestive health.  Her stool was still softer than normal.  Another issue I found was that the Venison meal was very high in protein.  My dog is nine years-old and not as active as before, so I wasn't very fond of the protein content.  This dog food may be better-suited for active or younger dogs.<br /><br />At my local pet store, they also have Lamb, La Porchetta, Salmon Bleu, and a couple other puppy variations.  I bought Lamb and Porchetta as well.  Among the three my dog ate, she seemed to like the Venison the best.  I knew this because she always hesitated with the Lamb and Porchetta.  I have not tried the Kangaroo (which is available on Amazon), but I may buy a bag just so I can know how it is for future reference, and I can offer a review.<br /><br />As for the price, yes, it's a little on the higher side.  At $17.00 for a four-pound bag, I would try it for a couple weeks and make sure your dog does well (enough) on it before investing in a regular diet regimen of this dog food.  For me, though, the results I received did not justify me having to spend the extra money for this dog food, even though my dog actually liked eating it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.

"Looking over the ingredients on the bag, I was pretty impressed.  Whole grains, no processed sugar, etc.  And at 140 calories per bag, not too bad in that respect either.  3 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein isn't too shabby, but with ingredients like quinoa and all the other whole grains, I was a little surprised that it wasn't more.  But maybe I have unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />The only problem was when I stated it.  The chips were hard, and my immediate reaction was that they had gone stale.  They had that 'stale taste' as well, if you know what I mean.  But with the bag just opened that moment, and an expiration date over a year in advance, I'm apt to believe that this is just how they're supposed to be.  The flavor was alright, lightly salty and a little nutty.  But this is probably not the best snack for children, as they will most likely not enjoy the hardness and staleness.","Good try, but tasted stale",3

"Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.

"Although my cat will play with this, I wouldn't recommend you purchase it.  The size is way big for me yet too small for my boyfriend, so it's difficult to manipulate comfortably.  A (much) longer, elasticized ribbed cuff would be better plus tailoring the fingers to actual human dimensions instead of all one length.  I'm kicking myself for not noticing that in the product pic.  The fingers have a rigid material (guessing plastic) that runs along a channel on top of each.  This allows you to wave the fingers for the cat. An elastic cord holding each bug to the finger also seems to run along the channel and will bunch up should the cat pull the bug for any distance.  The bugs themselves are cute and seem sturdy enough under supervision.  I would not allow my cat to play with this without me because there are too many little parts that could come off and tempt him.  Conceptually an interesting idea but the execution of this product is lacking.  I do plan to keep it tho since my cat enjoys the bugs.","Freddy Krueger, I've got your hand",3

"I've got 2 cats that love their wet food!!  We figured this'd be a big hit & for the 1st couple cans it was.  My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(.",Almost...,3

"I was expecting some ""serious flavor"" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips.

"There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product.",This is not the way to make a cup of coffee,3
"Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.","Why, oh why, add fake sugar?",3

"There is a lot of controversy surrounding this dietary supplement. The manufacturer claims that their product is the next best thing to eating fruits and vegetables, and that it picks its fruit and veggies at their peak ripeness, and then they use a proprietary process to reduce them to a powder containing much of the original vitamins and nutrients, while maintaining high bio-availability (which means that your body is able to use and take advantage of the nutrients instead of excreting most of it as waste).<br /><br />Many scientific studies, however, claim to disprove, or have produced conflicting results to, many of the manufacturer's claims about the product (see the ""Product Research"" section on Juice Plus' Wikipedia page: [...]. It doesn't help that the main product distribution process is through the use of multi-level marketing (aka pyramid scheme), and that many reviewers/commenters giving it 5 stars are also re-sellers of this product who always seem to want to send you to their personal website for more information about the product. FYI: I, personally, have not, do not, and do not plan to sell Juice Plus+.<br /><br />Before I knew any of this information, though, our Lamaze coach recommended it as a convenient way for my pregnant wife to make sure that the fetus (and my wife) would get as many vital nutrients as possible. Of course, nothing compares to eating fresh fruits and vegetables, but it's not always possible to eat as many as JuicePlus claims to contain.<br /><br />I have personally used Juice Plus off and on over the past couple years, and I've found that, when I take it regularly for a couple weeks (morning and night, not all 4 capsules at once), most of the tension in my neck and shoulders disappears, which is amazing. So, what's the main catch? At just over $160 for a 4-month supply (per person), it's not exactly a purchase you shrug off. Until I'm able to find something that is as natural, convenient, and doesn't have all kinds of crazy side-effects, though, I'm sticking with Juice Plus.<br /><br />EDIT - 09-13-2012: So I've taken a lot of heat (and have even been personally attacked in the comments) for referencing Wikipedia information from a couple years ago that indicated that JuicePlus distributors worked under a multi-level marketing arrangement, which functions similarly to a pyramid scheme, but is completely legal. The Wikipedia article has since been amended, and now states: ""Juice Plus products are marketed by individual distributors who receive sales commissions ranging from 6% (for enrolling five customers in 30 days) to 14% (for enrolling twenty customers in 30 days).""<br /><br />I also made reference to the many studies that tout the benefits of this product, and that many of the claims in these studies are ""disputed by consumer watchdog organizations and governmental agencies as misleading"". If you read the comments attached to this review (and my other, almost identical, JuicePlus review), you'll see that these studies are defended in the comments here (most likely by JuicePlus distributors) with almost cult-like enthusiasm. However, here is an interesting tidbit from Wikipedia in regards to these myriad ""independent"" studies. Discuss: ""Of the published peer-reviewed studies on Juice Plus products, the majority were funded and/or authored by the manufacturer, Natural Alternatives International (NAI) or the main distributor, NSA. two were funded by individual Juice Plus distributors; and one was conducted independently.""<br /><br />My review above praises the product for reducing tension in my neck and shoulders, but I feel as if I'm paying too much for this benefit. Wikipedia backs this up, referencing studies by the University of Berkley, as well as the Center For Science In The Public Interest, stating ""it contains too little fruit and vegetable powder to offer significant clinical benefits, its effects can be attributed to the inclusion of added exogenous vitamins and micronutrients, and it is excessively priced relative to its potential benefits.""<br /><br />I mentioned that I had not yet been able to find an inexpensive alternative to JuicePlus that offered the same benefits without any negative effects. However, for the past few months, I've discontinued JuicePlus, and have instead tried a product called JuiceFestiv (available through Amazon, Costco, and other retailers), which is similar to JuicePlus in that it contains powdered fruits and veggies in separate capsules. I've determined that JuiceFestiv offers similar benefits to JuicePlus, but at about 1/2 to 1/4 the cost (I've found the best savings when purchased on sale at Costco). That's right, you can get a 2-month supply of JuiceFestiv for $20 compared to a 1-month supply of JuicePlus for $40.<br /><br />I feel that it's important to take care of your body - you only get one - and that carefully researching and trying different natural supplements is a wise investment of your time and money. In this case, MY OPINION (which is backed up by research) is that JuicePlus is overpriced for the benefits it offers. I encourage everyone to try both JuicePlus and JuiceFestiv for themselves; compare the benefits your body receives, and compare the cost per benefit. You may find differences - nobody's physiology is exactly the same - but it's our differences (even of opinion) that make the world go 'round, right? :)",Juice Plus+ Orchard and Garden Blend capsules,3

"We are very careful about which foods we buy anymore, avoiding anything with grain in it.<br />Cats don't eat grains in their diet on any regular basis, but it is a cheap filler for many<br />manufacturers of pet foods.

I am used to cat foods<br />being packaged in a more verticle-oriented package. This one is large and flat, more like dry dog food<br />packaging.<br /><br />Both cats were very interested as soon as I took it out of the shipping box (of course, they<br />think every box coming in to the house is surely something wonderful for them anyway!).<br />I cut the top open, and fed them a handful. It was inhaled! While I am not overly impressed with the<br />ingredients (they could do a lot better), it isn't the worst by a long shot, and I don't think it will<br />bother either cat. If it does, I'll come back and update my review.<br />Would I buy it again?  Maybe - but right now, I have three gallon-size zipper bags full of it, so it'll be<br />a while! Glad they like it!

"Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about. Unless of course BPA free packaging is your primary purchase criterion. If so, buy em now and don't read any further.<br /><br />If not there are some issues to be aware of...<br /><br />I understand that Wild Planet is the brand. But what about the ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that there's no other kind, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring.

"I've never tried Rinaldi sauce but the description sounded good.  The ingredient list is simple and it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup or thickeners, like many other cheap sauces.  The price was very low at about $2.50 per 45 ounce jar (almost twice as large as most jarred pasta sauces).<br /><br />The price is great, but this is one of those times where you get what you pay for.  The sauce is thin and doesn't have a lot of flavor.  Luckily, a hefty sprinkle of parmesan cheese helped doctor it up.  I think it would be very good with the addition of some fresh mushrooms, olives, etc.  I would probably add some good crushed tomatoes to give it more tomato flavor. So, it has potential as a starter base!  It just doesn't stand on it's own as well as I would have liked.  It's ok for a budget sauce, but I'm not sure I'll buy it again.",Not bad for a budget sauce,3

Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT.

"Following the directions out of the box, the mix worked ""okay"".<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Top quality ingredients.<br />- Whole family ate until we couldn't eat any more. Still that always happens with pancakes and waffles. Strange.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- With no oil content, I had to follow the suggestion of adding a small amount of oil to each batch to prevent sticking. Even with this and a well-oiled Waring Pro, it still stuck. Not sure if this is strictly speaking the mixes fault though, lol.<br />- The real issue is that this is an overly sweet mix. I would suggest buying one with less sugar and just adding additional sweetening if you need it. Try their multigrain component.<br />- Building into the ""pro"" that they use high quality ingredients, I think they could have just gone the extra little bit and made this organic.

"After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.","Good alternative to potato chips, but very salty!",3

"I love a good cup of coffee & the scent of it is one of the best parts, from how it smells before brewing to the final product. So when I got the chance to try out the Melitta brand of coffee (something I've seen in some of my local grocery stores) for free, I figured what the heck? What resulted is a cup of coffee that is better than many of the average brands out there, but still not as good as the coffee that I brew at my bookstore job (when I work in the cafe).<br /><br />The scent of this coffee is great, so in that aspect it really didn't disappoint. It's also french press friendly, but then most coffees are. (But I thought I'd mention it since that's how I brewed my coffee.) I like my coffee strong, so I put more than the recommended amount & came out with a cup of coffee that was a little weaker than I generally like it.<br /><br />The taste of this is very good & is better than the Folgers coffee my mother gets (which I can either take or leave), FAR better than the shoddy Aramark coffee that is served at my full-time job (but then anything is better than that stuff), but not as good as the stuff that I make at the bookstore (my part-time job) or the Dunkin-Donuts brand coffee that a coworker makes. (He's got a specific way he makes it.) And compared to the pricey gourmet stuff my dad buys? This is swill in comparison. (But in all fairness, even my precious cafe coffee is swill in comparison. Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)<br /><br />Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first. The price for three bags of this is decent (six dollars) since the bags of this go for about seven to eight dollars in my neck of the woods.","Tastes nice, but I've had better...",3
"First the good news: My cats (all 7 of them) absolutely love this food.  2 of our most finicky will eat almost nothing else, but they gobble this down.  Clearly this is a good-tasting food.<br /><br />Now the bad news: Seems very expensive for what you get.  A look at the ingredient list reveals by-products and several grain fillers such as wheat gluten that you don't usually find in a so-called ""premium"" food.  Not sure why exactly it is so expensive.  They also do not even make this available in a 5.5 or 6 oz can, only the 3 oz size - so for multiple cat households the cost of these little cans  can really add up in a hurry.<br /><br />So bottom line, it is definitely a good-tasting food and if your cats are picky eaters it is worth a try.  However, the high cost and lack of a larger can option makes this a tough sell.  I am trying to find a better/more economical food that all of my cats will like, so I can transition them off this.",Cats LOVE the taste - but seems a little pricey for what you get,3

"I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other ""Bold"" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!","Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad",3

I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags.

I thought air-popped meant no oil, yet the ingredients list oil and the calorie count indicates calories from oil (50 calories from fat).

"I was recently diagnosed with severe acid reflux, so I thought I'd give this product a try. I purchased a bag of the French Roast from a local retail store. While I didn't find the flavor as bad as some other reviewers, it certainly doesn't have a typical coffee flavor. The closest thing I can compare it to is chicory coffee and even that's not completely accurate. Another review here describes a vinegar smell, but I don't get that at all. I opened the bag expecting that wonderful fresh coffee aroma, but the smell is something else completely. The good news is the taste isn't as bad as I would have anticipated, although I was hoping for more. If you aren't picky about coffee flavor and just want something to replace your morning cup, give this a try. Just don't expect a true french roast boldness. Also, my understanding is it's not just the acid in coffee that causes problems, but also the caffeine, so this isn't a complete solution.

"While the premise of this drink is good (all juice, no sugar added), it fell short for me.<br /><br />First of all - the taste.

It's not a bad taste, but not one I was expecting.<br /><br />Secondly, if you're looking for a dietary drink, look elsewhere. Although the label would lead you to believe with ""no sugar added"", the nutrition facts give the real story for all this juice: 130 calories in the tiny 8.3 oz can!<br /><br />For comparison, that's MORE calories than Coca Cola Classic (97 calories in 8 oz).<br /><br />To be fair, this can of Switch should be better for you in moderation - it has 100% of your daily Vitamin C, and no corn syrup (unlike Coke).<br /><br />One final note - the label claims ""100% juice carbonated"", but this is juice from concentrate, reconstituted with sparkling water.<br /><br />Ultimately for me, the small portion, high calorie count, and just-ok taste will leave me with other choices.

"Picked up a box of Kellogg's Special K cracker chips (Sea Salt variety) today at the grocery store (I did not buy from Amazon).  They also come in at least one other flavor that I saw--Sour Cream and Onion.<br /><br />Taste and Texture:  They are crunchy, potatoey and a little on the thick side compared to most potato chips.  I was reminded of the look and texture of Munchos with a flavor combo of Munchos and Pringles.  They are small and round (about the size of a Ritz cracker) and have a bit of a scoop shape.<br /><br />Being hypertensive and not a big salt user, my palate tends to be sensitive to over-salty foods.  I found these chips appropriately salty to my tastebuds, so they may not be salty enough for a true salt junky.<br /><br />Nutrition Information:  I compared the nutrition facts on these cracker chips to the brand of potato chips I usually buy--Utz Natural 40% Reduced Fat Kettle Cooked.  The serving size on the Special K chips is 30 chips (30 grams) whereas the Utz serving size is 20 chips at 28 grams--not exactly the same, but close.

"I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.","Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7",3

"I am a Southern Gal living in California and had been looking for boiled peanuts online for some time. The shipping costs for frozen ones are prohibitive for my budget, so I decided to buy these nuts.  We are talking here about a canned product, so I don't think it's fair to judge it based on its comparison to freshly boiled peanuts, however, there were several 'bad' nuts and the overly-spicy flavoring made this take a 3-star rating.  I just washed the peanuts carefully and they weren't too bad.  I have just ordered the regular, plain salted, peanuts and they are much better for me.  I've only had 3 cans of the regulars so far, yet they somehow seem to be of a better quality than the Cajun ones.  Hope this helps others make a decision on whether or not to buy.",Too Spicy for Me,3
"This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.","Good deal, but tea bags come all crushed in the box!",3

"MiO's Liquid Peach is a low-to-no-calorie mixer.  Mixing a squirt or two of it with an 8 to 16 oz. glass of water creates the equivalent of what I'll call ""peach water.""  While that tastes fine, mixing in more liquid makes the drink stronger than I prefer.

I will restate, however, that Griottines are much better and have less of a fake syrupy taste and hard chewy texture.<br /><br />I bought these at the recommendation of a local liquor store owner, who thought that they were amazing as far as cocktail cherries are concerned. My past preference has been Griottines, which never seem available on Amazon these days (in the larger, more reasonably priced jars). The Griottines are nice small, tender sour cherries. I would suggest finding those somewhere on line in the larger (10+ oz) size, which is more reasonably priced than the small size, or these Luxardo. Do yourself a favor and seek them out.",Not my favorites,3
"I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program. I am not a fan of soda pop. Carbonated beveraged do not agree with me. Happily, this product is very lightly carbonated and I was able to tolerate it. In my opinion here are the pros and cons to this product:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. I like the relatively small size (8.3 ounces). Often a standard 12 ounce beverage is just too much for me.<br />2. Taste: It did taste ""okay"". It is essentially juice with mild carbonation added. There is no sugar added but I still thought it was a bit too sweet for my taste buds. I do not have a ""sweet tooth"" and even with Orange Juice, I normally cut it with 50% water to reduce sweetness and calories.<br />3. Low sodium content: Only 15 mgs of sodium.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.Cost: I see these are selling at Amazon for a little under a [...] per can. The cold beverage market is fiercly competitive and I find Costco's Kirkland brand of Vita Rain to be an incredibly superior value at about [...] for a 20 ounce portion and it has a replacable cap so if you don't drink it all you can save the rest. Granted, this is not a completely fair comparison but we are in general talking about the cold beverage market.<br /><br />2. Caloric content: This is 140 calories for 8.3 ounces. If you get hooked on this beverage you'd better buy pants with expandable waistbands. Comparably, most orange juice (e.g., Tropicana and/or Odwalla) is 110 calories for 8 ounces. So, compared to OJ this is ""Loaded"" with calories, 100% of which come from 36 grams of carbohydrates, of which 35 grams are sugar, even though this is a ""no sugar added"" product.<br /><br />Summary: No doubt some people will love this product and others will find it too sweet. You might also like the light carbonation versus a standard soda pop. Only those people who are okay spending [...] day on Lattes are going to be okay with the cost of this product as a staple in their home. Other than the convenient small packaging size I would have no reason to purchase this product. I'm older now and retired and my kids are grown and gone. Back in the day when we would all hop in the mini van for a road trip I could see a use for this product. We used to carry along those little juice boxes that came with the straws and you'd poke a hole in the top. This beverage might be a little more fun for kids because it is lightly carbonated and, since it's juice, it gets a bit of a nod over punch or soda from a health standpoint. If you can get a free sample it's worth the try. I will not be buying this product.",Decent on the taste buds but high in calories and poor value,3
"This is a clever idea. Give your dog a treat by offering a lick or two of a bacon flavored liquid he or she will like. Take the cap off the bottle and there is a large ball similar to a roll-on deodorant ball - offer it to your dog and he'll lap it up. This appears to be an actual roll-on deodorant container that has been repurposed for this product. The problem is that the ball doesn't rotate freely. Our dog can't make the ball turn with his tongue. When I roll it with my thumb so he can get more, I have to go wash my hands as the liquid is brown and sticky. So - a mediocre rating because the product IDEA is good, but the container doesn't work well.",Dispenser doesn't work well...,3
"the product is listed as a 150g 6-pack.<br />Traditionally, when US companies do a bundle-pack they list the size of the individuals...so a 6 pack of canned soda would be a 12oz 6-pack, we would never see that listed as a 72oz 6-pack<br /><br />I foolishly assumed I was getting a real bargain, 6 150g bags, for about $8!<br />Oh so wrong.

"Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.",Dissatisfied with New ACS Additive,3

"Be aware that the title and the whole listing is wrong, I didn't receive six sets, or 1 lb worth of tea, I received 1 gift set.<br /><br />That being said I and my family drink tea daily. Between the three of us we go through about a gallon a day, usually a plain variety of orange Pekoe and/or Black tea. However, I like to mix it up and try new teas, and I fell in love with the quality stash teas after my boyfriend bought me a huge variety pack, so when I'm looking for something new I tend to gravitate towards the Stash brand.<br /><br />As soon as you remove the cellophane you get a very inviting aroma from each box, I tried 2 out of the 3 both hot and cold, and 1 (the cranberry) I only drank cold.<br /><br />Cinnamon Vanilla<br />I found this to be very sweet, so I would suggest cutting your sugar back by 25% - this one was my least favorite<br /><br />Warm: I preferred it warm over iced, which is rare. The flavors are much fuller while it's warm and the aromatics are better appreciated that way too,I tried it first with out milk, it was okay, almost reminiscent of warm apple cider sans the apple, after I added milk and it transformed into a liquid cinnamon bun! That was a delight!...at first. It was one of those things that the more you drank it the less you enjoyed it, the cinnamon began to overwhelm you and the sweet notes became clawing.. - My mother didn't like it plain or with milk.<br /><br />Cold: It's just shy of ""Okay"" while cold. the flavor's become very sharp and one noted it still kind of reminds me of an apple cider due to it's predominate sweet and cinnamon flavor, I haven't tried it cold with milk yet. later I mixed it 50/50 with our regular brew hoping to cut the overwhelming flavors, it didn't help any.<br /><br />Pumpkin Spice.<br />the pumpkin spice was my second favorite,<br />Warm: it was quite similar to the cinnamon vanilla as far as it being very aromatic but much more balanced, the clove dominated and while it didn't taste anything like a pumpkin pie (it contains no actual pumpkin) it did have a nice earthy notes to it.  It was easy to enjoy this one both warm and cold although I also preferred this over being warm. I added milk while it was still warm and preferred it with out. The milk didn't really compliment the flavors.<br /><br />Cold: The same thing happen with the cinnamon vanilla with it being cold, the notes are a little sharper, but it was still really enjoyable<br /><br />Cranberry Pomegranite.<br />I only drank this one cold, as I'm not big on warm fruits, I made a half gallon using 2 bags of stash and 2 bags of black tea, this gave it a nice fruity hint while still being a full bodied tea.

"A few months ago I was diagnosed with Celiac disease.  This is not simply a gluten intolerance, but a disease which attacks my intestines and inhibits the absorption of nutrients when in the presence of gluten in any form.  I was more devastated by this news than a couple of other serious revelations I had also received.  I love cookies, brownies, cake, pasta, etc. and actually wept at the thought of having to give them up.  AS I'm a rather determined person, I decided that I was going to get healthy and find alternatives to the things I love.<br /><br />I've been enjoying the KIND brand of fruit and nut bars, and have recently found Caveman Cookies.  The packaging is cute, and I loved that a sample of the Original flavor was included.  I also loved the consistency of this cookie, as it was moist and chewy.  Having said that I think perhaps I'm not a big fan of carob.  About the Alpine flavor I would say its decent, but I much preferred the Original flavor included as a sample.  It does take care of the craving for cake and/or cookies though, so that's good :) On a side note, my 2yr old loved them and threw an ever loving fit when they were all gone.  I likely won't buy the Alpine again, but I'm likely to be a devoted fan of the Original in the forseeable future.

"I'm not a fan of fig newtons, mainly because of the figs, so when I saw the new Newton Fruit Thins I thought I would give them a try.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  The fig wasn't overpowering and it tasted a lot like a graham cracker.  I could easily have one or two of these as a snack.  However, I doubt I could eat more than that in one sitting.  While they were good, they were a bit on the dry side and even the dried fruit didn't help with that.

"I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K"">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find ""burnt"", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G"">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective.

"Convenience is probably the best feature of this machine but a machine that heats, grinds, steams, packs and pumps is bound to compromise somewhere and this machine is no exception.  The Vienna Plus will not pump coffee at the finer grind settings.  On the other hand, coffee at the factory setting is not bad.<br />I drink my coffee black which means that the taste is not obscured by milk, froth, or spices.  But coffee straight from the Vienna Plus is muddy, foamy, and poorly filtered.

It's not quite as good as chemex coffee made manually but it's in the ball park and it is much more quickly produced.<br />Other reviewers have complained about the plastic housing of the Vienna Plus but I suppose a solid metal housing would cost far more.

Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar.

"Putting flavor on regular water really depends on one's preference. I am curious and very intrigued with this new product that I tried the following three flavors: Peach-mango, sweet tea and peach tea. Out of the three, I prefer sweet tea the best as it tastes closer to the real kind than peach tea and peach-mango. Although I prefer water in its plain form, the taste is not far from ready-to-drink flavored water available commercially. If you like those, it might worth to try as you more control in what flavor and much flavor you want to put in your water.<br /><br />Mio is very concentrated ""water enhancer"" - I never heard of those words until now.

Nutritionally they are good, too, with an acceptable amount of fiber, protein, sugar, and calories for this type of product.<br /><br />But this is not better than several other cereal, fiber, or granola bars I've tried in the past.<br /><br />It could easily have more fiber in it or even less sugar so why it does not, I'm sure especially when this is part of the Special K family that promotes itself as a good way to lose weight.  These could do this and still have more chocolate, too.  Look at the Fiber Plus bars or the Fiber One bars for an example of a better product.<br /><br />This is certainly better than grabbing a plain granola bar or a candy bar but it does not meet the nutritional vales or the taste values of other similar bars.",Good but Not Better,3

"UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me...well, would a 1 & 1/2 actually, but it really won't let me do that.<br /><br />NEITHER cat ever became fond of this, and we stopped using it completely when I found two 1"" bones and several smaller bone chunks in one of the cans of the ""Snapper"" flavour.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have two cats: Bruegel, a 16 year old female who is very petite and very picky, and Banjo, a 7 year old male who is very large and quite indiscriminate in his choice of what to eat. Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours.",So Far the Kitties Aren't Buying It,3

"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce<br /><br />In my opinion, as far as taste, less is more with this product.<br />I drink only water or tea during the day so I was looking forward to adding a nutritional drink to my diet.<br />The first time I tried it, I added too much and it tasted like medicine; more like cherry than fruit punch.<br />As far as packaging, I like having this in a bottle instead of packets however the squeeze part in the cap just did not work for me. I was using a mug to drink from and even though I had this totally upside down it managed to go everywhere! I think just a tiny hole would make it easier and less messy to use. I didn't try this with a water bottle so I assume that would be easier to dispense. Also, with water in my mug I could add more water if I added too much of the drink.<br />I didn't feel energized at any time after drinking this product. The added vitamins can only enhance my diet so I like this aspect. The vitamin content is only 40% for the B (3, 5, 6, 12) and 120% for Vitamin C and 10% for Chromium and Zinc.

Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.

"Maybe it is unfair to compare but I had to ask myself if I would purchase Snackwell's caramel popcorn instead of Cracker Jacks.

The popcorn was very fresh tasting. Adding the drizzle of fudge did not bring a taste of chocolate.

If I'm using fat-free milk in my cappuccino, I don't want to dump a bunch of sugar in.

"On the back of the package there's the question ""What makes a well rounded meal for adult dogs""?  Well, according to the Chef Michael recipe it's MEAL.  Though beef is listed as the first ingredient (and is about 28%) the rest of the meal is meal.  Soybean meal, corn gluten meal, poultry by-product meal, plus soy flour, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, ground yellow corn (corn flour), ground wheat (isn't this flour?), pearled barley and glycerin.  Additives include animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols and animal digest (duh!).  Other fun stuff like salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor (so it tastes like steak not meal) dried green beans and dried potatoes and a lot of chemicals.  If you're wondering why so many meal and other flours, it's so that they can say that Beef is the number one ingredient.<br /><br />The bag says all the stuff up above makes it ""Grilled sirloin steak flavor and potato & green bean garnishes"".  A ""garnish"" is an item or substance used as a decoration or embellishment accompanying a prepared food dish or drink, per Mr. Collegiate Webster.  In other words, it's there to make things look better, but better for who (or is it whom?).  Now my dog doesn't have that sophisticated a palate, he's a rescue from a West Virginia and he likes a garnish of dog poop with his road kill, vegetables are for 'sissy' metro-dogs.<br /><br />This is a 'well rounded meal for adult dogs' containing 23 essential vitamins and minerals. (Since so many of these Vs and Ms are supplied by those unpronounceable chemicals, I feel like I'm poisoning my dog while I'm making him healthier.)  Per the bag they (Nestles Purina PetFood Company) prepare it with care (no added artificial preservatives, just lots of natural chemicals) and you then serve it with love (love is not included, you have to supply your own).<br /><br />""Animal feeding tests using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures sustantiate that Chef Michael.... provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs.  (Just remember to change their oil every six months, rotate their paws and vacuum their coats periodically. 'I confess, I made that up.')  'The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a non-profit organization which sets standards for the quality and safety of animal feed and pet food.  ... there are non-voting advisors on each AAFCO committee who are mainly from industry, such as the National Grain and Feed Association, Pet Food Institute, and American Feed Industry Association. Unlike the FDA, AAFCO has no regulatory authority.'<br /><br />OK, let's remember that it's dog food.  Years ago we never bought dog food, the dog ate what we ate, with a little oil added from packed sardines to add luster to the dog's coat.  Dogs are carnivores.  In the wild they are scavengers and eat anything that isn't tied down, or tied down to long.  All these meals and flours are added for one reason and one reason only, 'THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN MEAT'.  Like most pet food, it's made to look and smell better to owners, most dogs could care less what it costs (unless they're an economics major) so I buy the cheapest I can find.

Out of the three, I prefer sweet tea the best as it tastes closer to the real kind than peach tea and peach-mango.

"This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU ""Petit Beurre"" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores).

"I like Starbucks. My partner does not much care for them. So you get both sides of the spectrum in this review.<br /><br />On opening the bag (which didn't seem to be vacuum packed ??) the coffee smells slightly of vanilla and you can see little bits of bean (or something non-coffee) in the mix. While brewing I have to say I didn't smell much, but when the coffee is poured into the cup there is a nicely subtly hint of vanilla aroma. (Nothing like the Folger's we often buy, because...hey! We are cheap).<br /><br />My partner says: it's ok. It almost tastes like someone put vanilla extract in the pot because there is an almost alcoholy aftertaste to the brew.<br /><br />I get almost no vanilla flavour, but the scent is pleasant.

I think that, at best, this is an average cup of coffee. P-)","Ho, Hum",3

"When I spent time in N Italy a few years back, several people recommended Lavazza...so I was eager to try these pods when I purchased my new machine.  The flavor is good, decent amount of crema, smooth but rich....  However--and it is a  big however--at least ten percent of the two boxes I purchased were defective.  The pods were not sealed properly and had big gaping holes where the coffee was leaking out...so you also lost the proper pressurization...

"These Emerald Forest Xylitol Wintermints may meet your needs or may not. I tried them out because I was looking for a xylitol mint (for the dental/gum health benefits) that had xylitol as its primary ingredient. These fit the bill. They are moderately sweet but very mild on the mint side. The drawbacks for me are that they are very small and dissolve very quickly. I usually pop at least two at once because they are small, and they dissolve in the matter of a minute. If you are looking for a strong flavored mint that lasts more than a minute, these are not what you are looking for.",Very small and quick dissolving,3
"I had never heard of the Celsius brand of canned iced tea before I got the case to review.  After trying it (along with some of my co-workers whom I shared the case with), we've pretty much come to similar conclusions:<br /><br />PROS - taste is ok, similar to other canned/bottled ice teas like Lipton (but not Snapple).  The tea seems to almost be some kind of energy drink (without it explicitly saying it's an energy drink - there is a warning about high caffeine sensitivity/content on the can).  On the other hand, it does NOT contain so much caffeine (like a Red Bull) that your heart will race.  Everyone that tried it said they felt more alert, but without the jittery/edgy feeling of so-called energy drinks, and without the crash a couple of hours later.  Each can only has 10 calories and the ingredients seem relatively innocuous/not a lot of chemicals.  Price per can works out similar to other energy-type drinks (though way more than soda).  Non-Carbonated.<br /><br />CONS--if you don't like Acai berries' taste, you will probably not like this tea - Acai has a somewhat tart aftertaste - the tea itself is also not terribly remarkable (compared to brands like Snapple and Arizona).  The calorie burning claims are pretty hard to verify - maybe the drink is intended to boost your energy before a workout, so you can work out more effectively?  Cans didn't seem too sturdy - one got punctured in transit, and several got dented (probably more of an issue if you have it shipped; not sure if this is available in stores?).<br /><br />Overall, an ok product, so you'll have to weigh the pro's and con's I mentioned.  If you like Acai taste, you might enjoy this more than most.","OK product....not so sure of the 'calorie burning' claims, though",3

"This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis.",The Kiwi is a bit overpowering.,3

"These Jelly Belly jellybeans come in a nice resealable stand-up pouch which lists the different jelly bean flavors on its back. There are plenty of jelly beans in this container - enough to last the casual jellybean eater at least a month or two. The inclusion of forty-nine different flavors in one bag really drives me to assign favorite and not-so-favorite flavors: some of these beans are too wacky and taste strange while others [particularly the fruit-flavored beans in my opinion] are excellent. Each jellybean is brightly-colored and easy to tell apart from its peers, so you can theoretically hone in on a particular set of flavors as you whittle down the contents of this bag.<br /><br />Honestly, I would probably go for the ""Superfruit Mix"" or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IKG3S0"">Jelly Belly Soda Pop Shoppe Jelly Beans, Assorted Flavors, 3.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> next time, only because of some of the oddball flavors included in this pouch.

"I bought a massive box of these in my enthusiasm for chocolate-covered gummi bears.  It sounded like quite a bargain compared to paying for bears by the oz. at the local candy store.  I had never seen these packaged and boxed -- only unpackaged in plastic bins.  Sadly, the boxed bears were disappointing.<br /><br />They're disappointing because the quality of the chocolate is poor.  There is little coverage of the bears, and the chocolate is not a rich, milk chocolate, but some chocolate-like brown confection, much like orange drink hardly compares to actual juice.<br /><br />The bears are also non-traditional and lacking because of it. The flavor is a little bit off, and their shape is squashed -- not dimensions of more original gummy bears.<br /><br />If you have no other option besides these, I'd say go ahead and buy the bears.  Or if you are introducing chocolate covered gummy bears to someone who finds the idea inconceivable, sure, give them a try.  Maybe you need all the extra packaging for hygiene reasons.<br /><br />But if you've had real gummy bears covered in real chocolate, these are going to disappoint.",Disappointing imitation of chocolate-covered gummy bears,3

That is the only way I can describe it.  Sandy.  I don't know if it has something to do with the ""organic"" label or not, but there it is.  To be honest, that sandiness is the reason I will not buy these again, and I would not recommend anyone to buy them.  At the same time, I cannot recommend anyone *not* to buy them, either!

"I usually buy my cats all natural organic foods, such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. Well, all of those are VERY expensive and PetSmart doesn't carry Halo brand. I'm really big on only giving my pets foods that have decent ingredients. Wellness, Halo and Blue Buffalo all have all ingredients that I would eat, and ideally this is all I would ever feed my pets. Sadly, times are tough and this product is much more fairly priced. Though the ingredients aren't all great, the first ingredient is a true meat and not just by-products or corn meal. So, hesitantly I bought this instead. I also had a coupon, which is almost always available on their website- for $3 off. ALL five cats LOVED it. It must be a VERY palatable food. They went from eating one bowl every three days each to one whole bowl a day each. They don't seem to be getting getting fatter from it, and I haven't seen one hairball since. I think this is a decent food if your low on cash, but not great for all the time. I kind of view it as a junk food or snack for my kitties.

"I don't know that there is anything about Essentia's taste that will wow you.  It is high pH, as in its alkaline water, and it is purified.  On the other hand its municipal tap water, apparently from a variety of municipalities.<br />So, while it is probably good for you, as far as its pH and electrolytes, taste wise it is just OK.  It doesn't have that ""clean"" taste familiar to those who drink spring waters.  Instead it tastes like what it is, tap water.<br /><br />You may indeed notice a ""silky"" taste - it has sodium bicarbonate in it.  That's baking soda to you and me.<br />I am not sure exactly why the sodium bicarbonate is in it, since Essentia advertises that they use electrolysis to split the water into negative (alkaline) and positive (acidic) ions.  It may be that the sodium bicarbonate is meant to support the stabilized pH or aid the electrolytes.<br /><br />Either way, if I want baking soda in my water, I'll add it myself.<br /><br />IThe bottle size is nice, about the equivalent of three ""individual size"" (16.7 ounce) water bottles.  So this is something you can drink over a few hours, or during physical activity to replenish lost fluids.  At the same time, the bottle is not so large as to make it a problem to bring with you.<br /><br />If you are looking for alkaline water, this might be a good purchase for you.  If you are buying water purely for superior taste, this isn't anything special.<br /><br />Overall, it is what it is advertised to be.

I found a copycat recipe I wanted to try but could never find a white basalmic vinegar in the local stores, hence my purchase on Amazon (they have everything!!!). I made the dressing and though it wasn't an exact match it was close, the main difference being my version wasn't as sweet and mild. I did add more sugar which helped but as I have made other dressings with the darker balsamic vinegar I know that the sugar I added was substantial.

"The taste: B+<br /><br />This drink is quite tasty. It isn't the best instant coffee drink I've ever had, but close.<br /><br />But it is way too sweet for my taste. I put only one scoop (instead of the recommended two scoops) in a glass of water, and it is still too sweet. But this comes from me who usually drink black coffee, so may be just my personal preference.<br /><br />The fact that this drink uses primarily fructose instead of glucose doesn't help either. The recent studies show that fructose is ""more bad"" than glucose due to heart disease and diabetes concerns. (I provided a scientific link here, but it was edited out by Amazon. But you can search on the Internet.)<br /><br />Primarily because of the sweetness, this drink is enjoyable at the beginning, but by the time you have had just a few sips, it becomes tiring, as if the only remaining dominating flavor is its sweetness, and there is very little other fragrance left. In contrast, a good espresso or latte drink maintains a strong fragrance all the way.<br /><br />However, it is an energy drink, so it is unfair to compare it with espresso or latte on the taste department. I'm just reviewing on this so readers may have proper expectations.<br /><br />The convenience: C+<br /><br />You shouldn't buy this just for its convenience, which is lacking for this product. It isn't easy to prepare this drink at all. For a hot drink, for example, it takes many steps, including mixing, shaking, microwave, stirring, microwave again, and shaking again. It isn't terribly difficult to do if you really want to have the drink, but frankly, I find it easier to prepare real espresso on my automatic espresso machine.<br /><br />In addition, it can be quite a messy experience to have this drink. Must be because it's a protein drink, the container becomes very dirty and very difficult to clean even if you try to clean it right away.<br /><br />The nutrition: Don't know. Supposedly good.<br /><br />But to be fair, I believe most people buy this product for healthy reasons, not for its sheer taste or convenience. I'm not exactly sure how it performs in the energy department, as I have no trustworthy way to measure, but the nutritional ingredients in this drink would indicate that it is far more nutritious than regular coffee.",Too sweet and messy,3

"It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice.

"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, was a little too sweet for my taste. You could not really referred to this as a juice because, it states right in the title drink not juice.

"Ok, so we are brand new to the gluten free lifestyle and this is actually the first attempt at bread that I have made.

"Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it. I bought 2 cases of this 3oz and they only touch it after realizing that I will not give them more food.<br /><br />It may be because I gave them Turkey & Seafood for a while in between. It's odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried).

The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.

My husband describes this as if eating a slice of chocolate cake but to me, it had the chocolate taste to it but it was very artificial tasting and not as good as other chocolate cereals I've had. The milk makes it so it's all soggy and no crunch and it only takes a few seconds for it to turn soggy. The way around it was to eat it dry and then take a quick chug of milk. That helped it a little bit but it's still not one that I would be buying on a regular basis.<br /><br />Compared to some of the other chocolate cereals on the market, such as cocoa pebbles, cocoa puffs, etc., this is probably at the low end of the totem for me.",It was just OK and this coming from a chocolate lover,3

"I'll preface this review by saying that as artificially flavored soda products go (most of what you will find on your supermarket shelves fall under that descriptor) this one is not bad... at least in terms of taste.  It is cleaner and truer than most. (Note: my kids liked this flavor better than the peach, but said the peach flavor got a bit lost). But, except for the environmentally-friendly packaging and convenience, that is where the good ends.<br /><br />While the cute branding is what is put forward, this is a heavily marketed chemical stew (to quote the web site from which I retrieved the actual ingredients) from Kraft foods.  In case you are wondering what is in it, here is the list:<br /><br />Water, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Malic Acid, Contains Less than 2% of Natural Flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium (Sweeteners), Potassium Citrate, Red 40, Blue 1, Potassium Sorbate (Preservative).<br /><br />I personally go well out of my way to avoid artificial sweetener knowing that most are carcinogens which were given a fast pass because the FDA believes that America needs artificial sweeteners. (I learned this in graduate school from a woman who did independent, unbiased research, and if you knew half of what I know... you would avoid them too!)<br /><br />So we tried these without the understanding that it is an artificially sweetened, as well as artificially flavored beverage.  I am really hoping Amazon will provide full information on the ingredients in their packaged foods soon! (By which I mean simply reporting what is on the label as I have above).<br /><br />I will note as i did in my other review that htis concept is not novel.  My kids have been making ""Italian sodas"" for years using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWA0A"">Torani Vanilla Syrup 750mL</a> syrpus for years.  I do something similar with a bit of juice (but am generally happy enough with fizzy water).  If you like a bit of flavor, I would recommend trying the Italian syrups: much better, much much healthier, or... just add a little juice ;)  (That adds instead of subtracting from the nutritional value).<br /><br />I would give this drink 4 stars for flavor, 5 for convenience, 4 as an overall ""green product"" from reduced packaging to minimal transportation costs... but a -5 for nutrition.  I am frankly not sure whether this mix of chemicals is better or worse than high fructose corn syrup (my family does not have weight problems) but, personally would rather side-step the entire issue of what is worse for them.  they don't drink Coke, or Pepsi, and I will be limiting this to a very occasional (is it right to call it a treat?)  Frankly I would rather hand them each a sugar cane (which I can get from the local farmers market).  That is a much healthier treat (and I do not have to question whether or not sugar cane qualifies as a treat.)<br /><br />I would recommend instead, trying one of the brands of Italian syrup which Amazon carries, and can personally vouch for many varieties or Torani.  If they ever go to packaging it in luch box squeeze bottles, this product is dead in the water. IMO, that is all it offers.",2% natural = 98% chemical,3

"I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee.  When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it.  Caramel-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial, e.g. Ghirardelli Chocolate Caramel flavored coffee.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark.  The Caramel Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no caramel odor and has even less caramel taste.  Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging.  In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup.  This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the caramel flavor.  Because the coffee does have a mild caramel tone, it actually has a bit of a burnt taste.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Caramel Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew.  If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box.  You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards.","Caramel Flavor So Mild, It Barely Exists...",3

"PAMELA'S OAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COCONUT WHENEVER BAR, with a glass of cold skim milk, was my after-dinner dessert this evening. While it served its purpose as a cap to the evening meal quite nicely, it left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, coconut was the only flavor discernable by me in the gustatory experience. Though obviously made with oats and containing chocolate chips, a taste of neither of those two ingredients came through.<br /><br />The ""mouth feel"" of the bar is pleasant enough. It's of medium density - as compared to the heavy density of a Bobo's Oat Bar (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714"">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) - and moist. Though the oat fiber is recognizably present in the texture, it's the flaked coconut that's most perceivable. The chocolate chips, while visible, contribute nothing at all in my opinion. (Again, if you're seeking a taste of oats, go to the Bobo's Oat Bar, which is very strong in that regard. If you're seeking the taste of chipped chocolate, don't dither about; go to a chocolate chip cookie, gluten-free if desired.)<br /><br />Pamela is apparently promoting an alternative snack for the nutritionally conscious and/or challenged as the packaging all but screams ""Wheat-Free"", ""Gluten-Free"" and ""Non-Dairy"", though the last claim is asterisked and clarified in the ingredients list with ""chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment.""<br /><br />The box also lists ""180 mg Omega 3 Fatty Acids"", ""9 Grams Whole Grains"" and ""0 Grams Trans Fats"", apparently for each 40 gram, 180 calorie, single-serving bar.<br /><br />To allow the buyers to feel altruistic when purchasing the product, it's also noted in the fine print that ""Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue and Autism Support Organizations."" Celiac sprue is caused, of course, by dietary gluten intolerance.<br /><br />While I'd otherwise award at least 4 stars to this bar, I'm only going as high as three because the product's taste potential seems so badly misrepresented by its name. Unless you especially like coconut, you may do better seeking gratification elsewhere. And if you dislike coconut, definitely steer clear.","A flavorful bar, but misrepresented",3

I ordered it in the vacuum bag and was lucky enough to get the original blend. I reordered, but am not sure which will show up.  I will say that Amazon does take about a week to ship it out, which seems long to me.

I added a second squirt and it tasted a bit like Vitamin water which I'm not a fan of. I added a third squirt and the taste was where I feel like it needed to be. Overall, the taste isn't strong.

"A little background:  I own a Gaggia for illy espresso machine <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00416L8OQ"">Gaggia for Illy Espresso Machine</a> that works with illy single-serve pods <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRE5D8"">illy iperEspresso Capsules Dark Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRAWCQ"">illy iperEspresso Capsules Medium Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a>.  I like the flavor of illy espresso, but my favorite is still the Nespresso line of coffee <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UW1KLM"">Nespresso Citz D110 Espresso Machine, Silver Chrome</a>.  When I saw that Coca-Cola was distributing illy in-a-can from Denmark, I immediately thought it might be a nice cold drink for my early morning, one-hour commute into the city.<br /><br />This morning I pulled two cans from the frig and drank them as I drove to work.  I tasted both the ""caffe"" and the ""cappuccino"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>flavors.  Here are my thoughts:  The coffee in these cans is nothing like what you make at home in your espresso machine--the richness is missing.  illy makes a medium and a dark roast; the coffee in these cans are more like the medium roast--definitely not dark.  But, bottom line, coffee in a can tastes exactly like you feared it would:  Coffee with that ""special"" canned taste.<br /><br />Comparing the two flavors that I sampled this morning, I like the cappuccino better than the caffe.  I think the cappuccino works better than the caffe as a cold drink.  The caffe was not a drink to be chugged down.  It is suited to sipping as it is not a thirst-quencher.  With the first few sips, I noticed a pronounced tangy flavor that I did not care for.  By the time I got half-way through the can, I had pretty much gotten used to the tang and it didn't bother me.I did not notice any bitterness in either of the flavors.<br /><br />Be aware of the size of these cans:  They are not as large as soda pop cans.  They are narrow cans, with the cappuccino can about an inch taller than the caffe can.  I mention this because I had trouble finding a place to set them in my vehicle's console because they are so narrow.  Your vehicle's can-holder space will be too large for these cans.  You  would have to wedge them in somehow to keep them from toppling.<br /><br />So, as with most everything else that you buy for convenience-sake, with these coffee drinks you sacrifice flavor for handiness.  If you really don't have time in the evening to put together a bottle of iced coffee for your morning commute, then the cappuccino is not a bad drink.  If you like a sweet coffee and if you like milk in your coffee, then the cappuccino is not a bad choice.  Personally, even though I don't have any extra time in the evening, I think I'll try to find the time to build myself an iced coffee for the morning--because I've just realized that it is very pleasant to have cold coffee to drink for my long commute, and canned coffee is not to my taste.",Thoughts from an experienced illy drinker,3
"After several samplings of these cookies and sharing them with both friends and strangers, the general concensus is that most everyone is pretty ambivalent.  They're not great, they're not terrible, they just...are.

"The vermicelli is made from brown rice but doesn't have a heartier flavor than regular white vermicelli. When you think ""brown rice"" you would think it would be thicker, but it isn't.

I used the recipe on the back of the package and substituted imitation crabmeat instead. The dish turned out OK, but the noodles are very bland tasting and I can see why chili sauce was recommended.<br /><br />My main issue is with the packaging.

"I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with ""natural mango flavor"" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout!

"Not to be a negative review, but adding some information I learned on this product that I feel should be on the product description for buyers. The information on the package states that the fries should not be given to small dogs. Well, we have a 10# Maltese small dog. Seller was very quick to respond to my question on this, saying that the product is like jerky and should be cut into smaller bits for small dogs. Well, I tried to cut it into smaller pieces, but it is tough stuff. Also, the product is from China. Not a surprise as lots of stuff from China. Other sweet potato fries at local store are from China also. And they say sweet potato jerky on package. I elected to ask Amazon for a refund and they were very prompt to issue a refund. I will go back to my local store and buy the treats I had purchased; the sweet potato fries were soft and moist and no problem for our small dog. These would probably work fine with a larger dog and be no problem for dog to eat.",Additonal Info on this product,3

I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.

"The main reason the Newton Fruit Thins earned 3/5 instead of 4/5 is because I'm the only one who liked them out of all the people I tested them on.<br /><br />Let me back up. These Fruit Thins are flat, crispy cookies with a touch of fruit flavor (Being from the Fig Newton family, I expected a bit of moisture, but you'll never get confused that you're getting one of your daily fruit servings from these cookies).  Since Amazon sent me an entire package, I shared it with my 8th grade students and some adults. The students across the board tolerated the cookie, but wouldn't select it given a choice. The adults were mixed in their reviews. Some gave it a thumbs down, citing a cardboard bland taste, and others loved it as a low-calorie snack (about 50 calories per cookie.<br /><br />Me, I think they live up to their name--a crispy thin with a hint of fruit. If you like graham crackers, you may like these, although they aren't as flavorful. I certainly don't find the 'luscious flavor of figs, sweet raisins and honey' advertised on the package. A couple of setbacks: The fruit is so sparse--ninth on the ingredient list and behind 'folic acid' and 'palm oil'--I don't know how they can call it 'real fruit'. It is 0 carbohydrates, which is good, but it's also 0% of vitamin C, A and Calcium. You won't eat these for their nutrients.<br /><br />One complaint: the packaging is inferior. When I opened the bag and tried to use the retie at the top, it fell off, so I had to transfer the crisps to a plastic bag.<br /><br />Overall, a good choice for a snack that doesn't overfill you.","I like them, but I'm in the minority",3

"This coffee was very good, being at least the equal of the best of the 7 different coffees I have tried thus far here from Amazon.  It was very fresh, had excellent aroma, and produced a very nice brew in my French press.  Upon receipt of the coffee I noticed that the bag was nowhere near full.  I have had other coffees come in less-than-full bags, but this one seemed to be way off. Since I sell merchandise online myself, I have an accurate postal scale.  The ""2 pound"" bag came in at almost 6 ounces less than a full 32, including the weight of the bag.  From previous orders from Amazon, other coffees seem to be based on the ""as delivered"" weight, not on some sort of weight prior to roasting.  The bag itself did not have a breather, so it is hard to imagine that almost 20% of the weight was lost in shipping. Don't know what happened here but the result is that I feel I payed almost 20% more for the beans than the advertised price.  I am curious if others have noticed this from this company. I would like to think that I simply got a careless shipment and not a care-less policy.","Good coffee, but 26.3 ounces, not 32.",3

"The Switch Black Cherry soda is a fine drink if you enjoy light-flavored carbonated beverages.  To my taste, this drink needs more intensity of cherry flavor to compete with the carbonation.  It contains concentrated cherry juice, along with the main juices of apple and grape.  I found the carbonation slightly more than I expected, after trying one of the other flavors of this brand.  The black cherry-flavored brand name colas deliver more ""cherry punch"", but if your goal is to drink something less sugary and more healthful(100% juice), than this is the one to choose.  The cans are small: 8.3oz., which is good for a small thirst or small child.",alternative to colas,3

So I found this to be on the sweet side but then I never add any sugar or sweetener to my drinks. (nor syrup to my pancakes, gotta have butter) You get the idea I prefer savory to sweet.

I have enjoyed all of them, but I've been searching for a coffee that's a little bolder to cut throught the milk of my lattes and cappuccinos.  My favorite in this regard has been super crema, as it produces a little stronger espresso than this blend.  Crema e Aroma is good in it's own right, and makes a wonderful espresso shot that's delightfully smooth and non-bitter.  Since I make mostly milk-based drinks, I'm going to look elsewhere for a richer roast.",Nice Italian blend that's more smooth than bold,4

"I will start off by saying that our household has no need for gluten-free products, but I'm always willing to try something new. That said, we've tried a few random gluten-free products, and these are actually pretty tasty. They kinda tasted like a spiced oatmeal cookie or a spiced carrot cake, except I am not big ""spice"" fan and the ingredient list just said ""spices"" so I couldn't pinpoint which spice it was that I didn't love. But my husband ate them and liked them AND my toddler ate them and liked them (though I've found he isn't terribly picky when it comes to granola bars) and I would eat it if they were all we had, but that strange spice flavor knocked them out of contention for me.

"First of all, remember that they are what they are: sugar-free candies. Sugar substitutes generally create laxative effects, depending on the person, that can range from mild gassiness to, well, let's not get into that. I think more than one piece is safe--at least 3 or 4 in most cases--but it depends on you. And that's not the fault of the candy, it's the territory in general--most, if not all such candies have that effect.<br /><br />That said, this is one of my favorite diabetic-friendly candies. They taste very much like the sugary ones I ate as a child. Everyone will have their favorite flavors, but the selection they have is bound to be most satisfying; the flavors are good, the taste well-crafted.<br /><br />The one drawback I found: if left too long, they will start to congeal or melt in the wrappers.

"I recently tried the KoI Chick Pea Curry after being impressed with their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS"">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  With the Butter Chicken, you have to add chicken and some other ingredients (i.e. water, butter), but with this Chickpea curry it's all inclusive in a pouch - simply squeeze the pasty contents of the pouch into a pan and heat up for a few minutes.  I served over couscous, not sure how authentic that is but it was pretty  good.<br /><br />The nutritional info says one pouch contains 2.5 servings but in my opinion it's only enough to feed one, and even then I'd want some rice or something with it.  It's high in sodium, but unfortunately so are most packaged foods.  I'm normally a big meat eater and even though this is a vegetarian dish I still found it substantial enough for a quick dinner.<br /><br />My only complaint is I'd say it is a little bit mushy, but overall it's not bad and for the convenience it's tough to beat.  Because it's so easy to prepare requiring no outside ingredients and with a shelf live of over 2 years, not only is this a good quick/convenient food option but stocking a few in the pantry in case of emergency (i.e. as part of hurricane preparedness stash depending on where you live) wouldn't be a bad idea as long as you have a way to heat it, like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PUR5E"">Coleman PefectFlow 1-Burner Stove</a>, although I'm sure you could eat it cold if necessary - and the pouch packaging is much smaller and lighter than canned food.","Not half bad, and super convenient",4

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A"">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0"">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As far as which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.","and in not-so-blind taste testing, our consumer picked....,",4

Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat.

"Annie's Deluxe macaroni and cheese comes with a pouch of cheese sauce, which tastes better than any dry powder variety and it is quicker to mix.  Regardless of how thoroughly I mix the cheese powder, milk and butter, the dry powder varieties do not taste as good as Annie's Deluxe.  Our 3 year old really enjoys Annie's Deluxe and I feel better offering her this rather than Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Even if the taste wasn't as good as Kraft, I would choose Annie's since the ingredients are natural and some are organic.  Kraft uses artificial color in their dry powder macaroni and cheese, though I don't think they do in their deluxe version.  Kids (and adults) don't need artificial colors!<br /><br />I would give Annie's Deluxe a 5 if they would reduce the sodium content and make a Deluxe version that included whole wheat pasta  and was ALL organic (currently only some of the dry powder versions are all organic).  And while I am creating my dream version, I would give Annie's a 10 if they would enrich it with some calcium and other vitamins and make a whole wheat bunny shape version! :)  My big hangup is that the sodium is too high (like all the other brands).  It would still taste great with a lot less salt (if kids are not given high sodium in the first place, their taste buds don't crave it).  Unless pasta is whole wheat (or other whole grain), there isn't much nutrition in it, so whole wheat pasta that is enriched is the way to go!  Annie's  offers many varieties that include some of the improvements I am  looking for, but it would be great if they would include them all in one version.<br /><br />Boxed macaroni and cheese is truly junk food no matter who the manufacturer, but Annie's is doing great things to make it better.  Knowing that macaroni and cheese is often ""kid food""  is reason enough to improve it nutritionally.<br /><br />The price is reasonable on Amazon and at WalMart, however most of the grocery chains and Wholefoods charge too much!  The best price I found was at Annie's home website when they offered 25% off and free shipping.","Great taste, but like the others too much sodium!",4

"This is our 3rd jug. My dog Loooooves it and eats his dinner out of it every night. Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!<br />UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!",Awesome product for many dogs!,4

"I'm writing this review to provide other interested customers with a more realistic expectation than the other review listed with this product does... The first time I've tried the Tea Forte Green Mango Peach tea was via one of their silken infusers. I LOVED the flavor of it, I didn't even notice at that point that there was any mint included with it. When I received the loose leaf tea I ran into the same issue the other buyer did: The tea had a strong mint flavor overpowering almost all other flavors in this tea. I went ahead and used much less tea leafs (I have one of their 12oz Kati tumblers and used just 1 tsp of tea leafs with that)and only left the leafs in the hot water for a minute or two. With that I was able to get the desired flavor. I can see how someone, that hasn't used the silken infuser and therefore has no idea what this tea is supposed to taste like, would be disappointed with this product. If you use the method of brewing I've described you barely taste any mint flavor and the mango and peach flavors come out as intended/desired.",You have to know the product to get it right!,4
"Good lemon & ginger tea. I like mine slightly sweet - helps to meld the lemon and ginger flavors. Has a strong peppery bite. My favorite so far is Tea Forte - I really like that one, but it is out of my acceptable price range. Twinings is a good substitute.",lemon and ginger,4

"I've been buying this company's cookies for many years.  They are tasty and don't seem ""weird"" although note that they have a rice-flour base, making them generally a tad crumblier and more delicate in flavor than cookies made with wheat flour.  They remind me of a light,  softer shortbread-type texture.  Personally I find this to be an appealing difference, adding some variety in choice (I'm not gluten intolerant but have a mild wheat allergy, so I can still eat some wheat cookies as well).  If you enjoy things like rice crackers, cream of rice, rice noodles and Asian dishes, you will probably like these and not find them strange.  In essence, I'd describe these as a lighter, more delicate version of a chocolate-chip cookie.",Good and Healthy,4
I find this product very easy to use.  I mix up a container and keep it in the fridge to add to the container I keep out for water all day.  I like the plain the best.  It has a refreshing faint taste of coconut.  I enjoy this much more than the canned or bottled coconut water.  The price difference makes it even better.  I will continue to order this product through Amazon.,refreshing change from plain water,4
"I took advantage of the 50% off special last summer to try some new-to-me products, including 4 flavors of these sesame seeds, and loved all of them!

"I get dehydrated easily and struggle to get water in my system every now and then. I decided to try MIO out, hoping it would get me to drink as much water as i could. Well, it does work for me so far. All i need in my water is just a hint of flavor. Nothing too overpowering. A tiny squirt gets the job done. A little taste goes a long way for me. Would have been better without the added coloring though. Will be getting another MIO in mango peach when this current supply runs out. No nasty aftertaste for me.<br /><br />The only bummer that i encountered with this shipment was the bottles of MIO were leaking despite them being sealed in their individual plastic wrapper. I had to wash them off before stashing them away in my locker. No way will i want to carry them around in my pocket or bag. In the condition that i found them in when i opened the package, i don't want them anywhere close to my bag or clothes since they leaked so easily during shipment.",Hydration Needs Met,4
"I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).

"I purchased these at Big R on a whim, a local farm store.  I'd been run ragged with the fall infestation of Wolf Spiders the size of ping-pong balls showing up in my living room.

I don't understand that some of the other reviewers are having problems with larger bugs, because I'm not.  I'm catching wolf spiders and large beetles just fine, pretty much anything unwanted that gets into my house gets snagged, even a snake.  Yes, that's right, a snake got into my house and got his head stuck in the trap. (olive oil and some TLC set him free, don't worry.)<br /><br />Last week, I caught a Bombardier beetle, and I'm SO glad he got stuck in a trap before my dog found him.  They can shoot boiling chemicals at you, giving you burns! I've ordered more of these traps and keep them on hand, they're great.<br /><br />I'm giving these a 4 star rating because it would be better if the glue covered the entire bottom of the trap instead of a square in the center.",Great traps!

"This is my first experience purchasing and using dried pears since I live in a place where specialty items like this are not easily found.  This is the best price available of the varieties offered on Amazon, and the company responds immediately, with low shipping charges.<p>The product is unsulphered, which may be prefered by some.  Its texture is tough.  Its flavor is present but muted, rather like canned pears.  That said, when braised in a little chicken broth, the dried pears perked up and did what they were supposed to do in a wild rice pilaf dish.

I gave him one and he promptly took it to his favorite ""eating spot"" on the rug and went at it. I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack.

"At the very least 4 Stars! Once the right amounts are figured out this coffee creamer is every bit as good as the fine amazon reviewers had mentioned. Might sound like I am a chemistry wannabee but it is imperative that the right amount is used, for too much is not half as good and too little also spells failure in the taste department. It probably deserves half a star more but the doctor is still out so for now 4 Stars, which is above average, stands in solid grounds. One thing I have found out that depending on the coffee I use (I use ground coffee in an old gevalia, cheap monkey that I am) the ratio changes. But once the right amounts are used this product elevates itself. Since sugar was a concern it is good that the free enterprisers of this beautiful country are seeing fit to consider the needs of those that wanna say bye bye to sugar (I use to go to the movies with a couple of pounds of See's Candies and with one or two avid chocolate lovers besides me, finish the whole thing!

The problem with 100% whole grains is that many individuals find them tasting too grainy. This is the case here. It is one of the reasons why some manufacturers do not use 100% whole grains. Secondly, the clusters remain hard even after sitting in milk or soy for several minutes. This may be too hard for some consumers.

But I knocked off one star because I don't see why it should be called ""cinnamon roll"".  There is no roll essence to it.

"Every Starbucks coffee I've ever tried brews up so strong and dark that I always have to reduce the amount of coffee from what the directions recommend (usually by as much as half.) This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect. First off, I must admit that I really don't care much for flavored coffees as I prefer actual coffee-flavored coffee. I also use a standard, automatic-drip machine (think Mr. Coffee), so I guess I'm not expert. But I do drink coffee daily and I love a good cup of rich, smooth coffee with a little real cream added. If you like your coffee VERY strong, brew this one according to package directions. I brewed it with half of the recommended amount and mixed in some Folger's decaf to round it out. You may be surprised to know that the result was a still-very-strong coffee (that some folks in my house wanted to dilute with water) that was smooth and tasty with just the right touch of vanilla. My husband drank it black and said it was ""fine"" but his only requirement of coffee is that it be strong, so this fit the bill. I added my usual cream and a distinctly unusual half-teaspoon of sugar. The result was a delicious, smooth, creamy coffee with a kick of sweet vanilla. Although I'm still no big fan of sweet or flavored coffee, I give this a big thumbs-up for taste. Since the holidays are approaching, I can see our family drinking this with dessert (or even as dessert after some turkey and dressing), and I also am considering picking up a few bags as holiday gifts. If you like Starbucks coffee this may be one you'd like to try.",Very Rich and Dark,4
"I'm not a fan of flavored coffees, but I enjoyed this one. Coming out of the bag, the smell is chocolaty and the vanilla aroma is very strong and pleasant. It produces a coffee that is smooth and creamy, with a thin layer of fine froth at the top when I made it in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264FT9K"">Bodum French Press</a>. I like my coffee piping hot with Half & Half and 3 sugars. The sweetness really brings out the vanilla flavor. Drinking it black, however, there's not much flavor to write home about. Without sugar and cream, it doesn't taste like either coffee or vanilla.<br /><br />The grind is extra fine. I was pleased by the small amount of the dust that passed through the Bodum and into my cup. For French Vanilla lovers, this is a very good price for 3 bags of coffee. The only gotcha is that it is ""Naturally and Artificially Flavored"" and not all natural. It tastes good, however. Lastly, the product is kosher, as indicated by the U symbol on the bag.",A smooth and flavorful French Vanilla roast,4

"I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.<br /><br />These aren't the ""spicy"" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.<br /><br />I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.

The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting.

Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here.

"I've never had much food from Singapore, so I can't say whether or not this was authentic.  But I liked it, and it seemed to taste ""exotic"" anyway.  Not your standard burger and fries at the very least.<br /><br />It was extremely easy to prepare.  All you do is mix the two pouches with water, and add in some beef chunks that you've been cooking.  And pour on top or rice (or mashed potatoes the box suggests).  Its that simple.  I think in total, with cooking the meat, it took maybe a half hour, and most of that was just it simmering on the stove while I was cooking the rice.  Sure I probably could have added some veggies, but the box didn't say that you really needed to, and there were some green things in the sauce, so hey, its all good.  The sauce itself was kind of an orangey-brown color and it was thicker like a gravy.<br /><br />The taste was a little bit spicy, but I just threw some plain yogurt on top and that cooled it down.  The coconut came threw quite strongly and that was the dominant taste for the dish.  The chili was also quite strong and that was probably the second most dominant taste.  There were other flavors of course, but they all melded together and to be honest I couldn't really distinguish what precisely they were.  Except maybe the lime leaf, I did taste a bit of lime.  But it was tasty, and with the exception of one in the household, not too spicy.<br /><br />I like that the ingredients didn't have preservatives or coloring though.  It seemed somewhat healthy.  And while there are a lot of ingredients, they all seem to be fairly normal and pronounceable.  So that's good.  The fat content could be considered a little high, but I do think that its probably healthy fats considering most of it is from the coconut.<br /><br />I liked it, and I'll probably eat it again.  I might even try some of their other flavors as well.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",Rendang Curry Kit,4

"I love this drink, I truly do.  It is the first pick-me-up drink I have found that works for me.  I react strongly to large amounts of caffeine (it makes me incredibly hyper) and I never developed a taste for coffee, so my choices for something to keep my brain running when I'm worn out are limited.  Add to that the fact that I'm not a big soda drinker and the choices are even fewer.  Neuro Sonic is a great blend for me.  There's some caffeine in it, but not as much as other products, so it makes me a bit quicker on the draw without making me babble like an idiot like I do when I have too much caffeine.  It's carbonated, which I don't care for, but *lightly* carbonated, so it's not unbearable for me.  The flavor is pleasant and light, not at all overpowering.  The packaging is unusual, so it stands out in the refrigerator at work and I never have to wonder which drink is mine.  The one major con to this product is the price.  As the other reviewers have stated, it is very expensive.  I would probably drink one of these a day if it weren't so expensive.  As it is priced currently, I don't even drink one a week.  I save them for when I really, really need a boost.  So, yes, as another reviewer said, this company could really learn something about the merits of selling product based on quantity.  I would be happy to purchase it more often, if the price were to come down to something more reasonable.  That said, I do still buy it and I do still believe in the product.  The price just dictates that I consider it an indulgence instead of a necessity.","Great Product, But Expensive",4

It is a bit less dense than the kind we are all accustomed to buying in the grocery store, but it is by no means watery.  I did add an extra egg yolk to the pie to make sure it set up.  The pie was somewhat wetter than my typical result, but it held its shape and tasted great.  This made excellent pumpkin bread.  My family has devoured almost a whole loaf since last night.

"One big complaint I have about protein bars is that most of the manufacturers want to give us something that tastes like a candy bar.  This Pure Natural Bar, Chocolate Almond is refreshing because it has a different consistency.  Sort of like a brownie, this bar has a nutty and slightly fruity flavor.  It is dense, but satisfying.  It didn't feel like a candy bar substitute, but a healthy snack.  Give it a try!",Chewy and flavorful,4

"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.<br /><br />The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!<br /><br />Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a ""zing"" after drinking this, though.",Tasty,4
"My family really liked these muffins.  I also made them while on vacation at my sister's house, and her family loved them.  I just got back from a Bible study full of pretty picky eaters, and they all said they were good.  They're usually pretty honest about how the gluten-free food I take tastes, even telling me once that some store-bought cookies I took tasted like cardboard.<br /><br />I did notice a VERY SLIGHT bitter aftertaste, but it was not too bad.  I think next time I make these I may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch.  Oh, and I only added 3 TBS of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  I'm sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether.<br /><br />I just went to the Hodgson Mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  This mix does not have garbanzo flour.  They use sorghum instead, now.  I did not make these as muffins.  I found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which I prefer to muffins.  Very good.  I will continue to make these when I need something fast and don't have time to make it from scratch.<br /><br />Oh, and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta, Tinkyada makes a great brown rice pasta.",Very good for a store bought mix,4
"Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds make a great on the go snack. I especially like the container as it fits nicely in the cup holder of my car and stroller. It makes a nice take-along snack during the day when running around and not having time for a meal always. The almonds have a hint of dark chocolate flavor. By the time you realize there's chocolate flavor, poof it's gone and you're onto the almond taste. For a person who enjoys almonds and the dark chocolate flavor is a bonus-this is still a nice snack. If you are purchasing this thinking it will be more dark chocolate and less almond, then you will likely be disappointed. I did not give 5-stars only because when I gave the almonds to my children who normally eat plain almonds and other nuts, they did not care for the dark chocolate roast. Hey what do kids know!",Good On The Go Snack,4
"I really enjoy the distinct flavor of this Tazo. I prefer the straight green teas, rather than those with other flavorings added (except for the delicious Genmai Cha with toasted rice).  I've been trying a variety of Japanese green teas, including Sencha, and some brands have been high in quality and flavor.  But they have been weaker-tasting than this one, too, which has disappointed me.  I find that most Chinese green teas tend to have a smokier or not as bright flavor, and are sometimes not even green in color.  Although labeled ""China"", this Tazo looks and tastes more like a grassier Japanese-style green tea.  I've read that fluoride levels in green teas, particularly those from China, can be pretty high, and I don't think this Tazo green is organic either.  Some teas labeled ""Japanese"" are actually harvested in China.  I noticed many green teas advertised here do not mention where the tea comes from.  It's a concern, though not a deal-breaker, and I'm still looking for a real Japanese green tea that matches the flavor strength of this one, as well as the reasonable price.","Very good flavor, more like a Japanese-style green",4

"We've used this cereal many times for our twins and have had no problems. It's a great brand.  Earth's Best rice cereal is made from whole brown rice whereas this one lists organic whole oat flour as the first ingredient.  Flour compared to whole grain, for the same price.  That first ingredient is a qualitative difference, whole rice versus oat flour, is the reason we go for the rice one when we can.<br /><br />I have to load up at the store when they have Earth's Best rice cereal. They always have this one, the Whole Grain Oatmeal Cereal though. This one is never sold out.<br /><br />Both of the two above-mentioned cereals work perfectly in formula, mixing right in as you'd want. Our babies are growing and they liked these cereals the moment they were introduced. Of course, one has to test a food out on one's baby(s).

"A friend gave me a bar of this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NF4C7E"">Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate 100g</a>, imported from Poland by his girlfriend's family. I've had lots of amazing European chocolate so I opened it with high expectations.  Yes, it has an exceptionally creamy texture and very nice mild flavor, a bit sweeter than I expected and quite milky.<br /><br />Milka's not the chocolate for me, though. I prefer chocolate that's less sweet, darker and more strongly chocolate-flavored; 60 or 70% cocoa. Milka is probably not more than 30%. It's a nice product for those who like that concentration.<br /><br />Though this may be more information than you want in a review of a chocolate bar, I'd like to tell you about the company. Milka, first created in Austria over 100 years ago, is produced in several European countries and capitalizes on the idea of creamy milk from cows raised in the pure air of the Alps (though they don't mention where the cocoa comes from). Its wrapper is, and always has been, a distinctive lilac color with a purple and white cow pictured on it (explaining the Ogden Nash in my subject line).  Since 1970 the company has been through a couple of mergers and was acquired by Kraft Foods in 1990.<br /><br />I went to the company website to see if they sell darker chocolate. The home page asks you to choose a country--U.K., Turkey, Russia, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, etc. Each country's page is the distinctive Milka purple with an Alpine scene, and several have sound effects of lowing cows and chirping birds.  On the U.K. site you can follow an interactive tour and meet an Alpine cow (""Make a Moooo Mate"") and there seems to be something similar on the other pages.  Each country's site has a link to other Kraft company sites.<br /><br />To sum up: very nice chocolate if it's the sort you like. I enjoyed it well enough but liked the website much, much more.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010","""I never saw a purple cow...""",4

"These Crown Prince Sardines literally changed my life. You live for a few decades, a good 40 or 50 years, and you think you know some things. You think you know sardines. You think you know tomato sauce. But until the luscious, succulent, inappropriately erotic essence of tomato sardines that defines the Crown Prince line of product grazes your virginal, awaiting lips, you know nothing.<br /><br />When I discovered the Crown Prince Sardines it was a sort of rebirth for me. I had hit a low - my wife had dies three years previously in a freak zoo accident, and I had turned to substance abuse to dull the pain. My reliance on Oxycontin and other narcotics eventually took its toll on my life, both personal and professional. My relationships were a mess, and I had recently been fired from my job. I was sitting in my house, on the stained couch, staring at the eviction notice on my window, when I opened up a can - a little, red, 7.5 ounce can - a can I thought would contain some fish and sauce... But that can contained more. That can contained my salvation.<br /><br />Fast forward a year, and I'm kicking like a celebrity, living on Malibu with the stars. I eat a dozen cans of Crown Prince a day, and it gives me all the energy and positivity I could ever need. I've dropped my drug habits and started to take control of my life. No drug on earth can compare to the creamy, sweet-yet-tart tomato sauce contained in these cans. The sauce, though, is just the start - the sardines! The sardines are the thing! I bid you - if you have ever cared about anything, or anyone, you owe it to yourself and to them to order a 12 pack of these today. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />BUT. But. But. Why, you may ask, did I only rate this product four stars if it so changed my life? There is a catch. There is a trade-off. Nothing this good could be so (nearly) free. And I'm not talking about shipping.<br /><br />Three weeks after I started my Crown Prince consumption habits (which I continue to this day) I started to realize something strange was happening to me. I would wake up early in the morning - full of energy, certainly (thanks to my lovely sardines) but also somehow feeling as if I never slept. I remember one Monday, waking at the crack of dawn. I had a hunger for sardines, but there was something else, too. When I brushed my teeth that morning I coughed. A knucklebone came out of my throw and clattered into the sink. A human knucklebone.<br /><br />I can't say any more. The wrong person might be reading. Just know this: while the power that the Crown Prince Sardines grant is a great power indeed, it is also a heavy weight. It is because of this that I must only give the Crown Prince Sardines in Tomato Sauce a 4 star rating, though they are by far the most blessed and delicious fish to ever grace the sea or my plate.",Crown Prince Sardines are the ambrosia of the gods!

"I have had a ""twitching eyelid"" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied ""you have a magnesium deficiency"".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.",Great product!,4

To compare, Tostitos regular tortilla chips can be extremely salty, whereas these are not.  Flavor is also more dimensional than the Tostitos multi-grain chips (but not that far apart); the ingredients are obviously much better.  They do look nice with their textured nuts and such in them, so they would look much better than your average chip if you were hosting a nice party.","great flavor, but not outstanding",4

"I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.

"This food smells good, compared to a lot of dog foods, has beef, soy, potatoes & corn in it, but ell liked.

Looks like shredded jerky with smaller little bits in green & tan (I'm guessing soy & corn or soy & potato?)<br /><br />Well liked & disappears quickly! (practically inhaled!)<br /><br />The dog loves it & the cat even likes the smaller crunchy bits. Smells better than most pet food I've tried!<br /><br />If your dog likes beef, they'll love this! I was even tempted to try a bit it looked really good! Has added vitamin E & others for coat & intestinal tract. I'm not a vet, & don't know a lot about dog digestion, but this is a FAR cry from those round balls of who knows what. Looks & smells like real beef jerky (might even be?)<br /><br />Very well tolerated (both the dog & the cat like it!) Seems it would be easily digestible, as long as your dog digests beef OK.<br /><br />Does contain soy, and I'm guessing quite a bit, which is why I gave this 4 stars as soy that isn't fermented (along with most nuts) contains enzyme inhibitors which can be deactivated by soaking (such as with soaking almonds that BTW taste a LOT better that way!) or fermenting, which I doubt s done in the dog food, so I would investigate that further, as soy beans & nuts (at least in humans & from reading, apparently in dogs too) can reduce thyroid function, which is OK if your dog has an over-active thyroid, or Graves' disease, yet I'd look into how it is processed. I'm sure this action, if also true in dogs, like in humans can vary from individual to individual & it seems certain breeds are more susceptible to hypothyroidism than others. I've been told that some large breeds can benefit from soy, as they can be prone to hyperthyroidism. Stress also plays a factor in this in humans & I imagine dogs as well, so if you are looking for the the ""best food"" for your dog, you might want to get an intracellular nutritional panel (blood test by your vet) done & look at food analysis of different foods to find what is best for your dog.<br /><br />The soy may not be the best for all dogs, yet in others it may be essential to help your dog balance an overactive thyroid & if your dog's family has a history of hypothyroidism, it probably isn't the best. Best to consult your vet for your dog's needs, but I can say it gets gobbled up!","Larger pieces look like beef jerky shreds, small ones my cat likes!",4

"This is quite a unique brand of cat food. Their tagline is ""People food for cats"" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system.

"I tried the Nana's Bananas cookie bars for the first time this week. I love them! I don't have any gluten issues so I can't speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix.

"the tins are easy to open, filled with large (for sardines) filets. the olive oil is very bland, not remarkably different from, say, corn oil (not a compliment!). the filets are boneless but they have the silvery skin on. there are about enough filets in a can to cover a smallish slice of toast--4 or 5 filets, with some small pieces as filler. the texture is pretty good--dense, almost creamy. (in fact, you could cream these easily with a fork.) the flavor is very mild, too mild for me, undersalted (easy to fix)...  i admit that i like an assertive, salty fishy fish. (i eat anchovies straight from the tin!)<br /><br />i eat them as a simple sandwich, well drained, on toasted whole wheat spread with lots of french mustard. or tossed with a big green salad and a mustardy vinaigrette. a tasty, very healthy meal, low calorie meal, done in a matter of seconds. i bought these at about $1.80/can, and they are a better price and better quality than the ones i can buy at my local grocer. all in all, a good product, but nothing special.","mild sardines, a good value",4

"This is a wholesome beverage for drinking and on cereal.  I have been using Silk soy milk for coffee and tea and when I saw this rice milk which IMO is a better food to put in my body than soy milk, and for less that what I pay for Silk, I thought I'd give it a try.  For coffee and tea is is not even half as creamy as Silk so it falls short there.  I had figured it would be a thinner product but since Amazon's nutritional data stated 80 calories per cup, as opposed to 100 per cup of Silk, I figured I could use a bit more rice milk to make up for it's more watery consistency.  Well turns out Amazon's data is wrong, the rice milk has 100 calories per cup also.  There are other discrepancies between Amazon's data and what is printed on the box.  So it's a good product and I like the taste although I prefer the less sweet original version of Silk.

Even the sweet tea flavor does not avoid this, but it is somewhat more tolerable than the other flavors I have tried.<br /><br />Gripes aside, it's pretty good for what it is.

"I am a big fan of teas, including herbal.  During a normal day, I drink some PG Tips black tea for energy and herbal teas for the flavor.  This Yogi tea is essentially a combination of both.  It contains black tea, green tea, and a variety of herbs that create a vanilla chai flavor.  The flavor is really good, albeit similar to other things I've had.  The green and black teas provide an energy boost from caffeine (80 mg), while the organic Gotu Kola leaf and Ashwagandah provide the more hippy resolution to low energy.  I really don't know if the latter ingredients help, but I can say that I don't get jittery.<br /><br />The one qualm I have is that by mixing herbal, black, and green teas, you are not going to get proper steeping on all.  For example, black and herbal are best steeped in freshly boiled water, while green can become bitter if you don't let the water cool a bit.  All types are generally steeped for different times as well.  Regardless, I still enjoy this tea enough to drink it regularly and if you enjoy flavors such as cinnamon and ginger, I would recommend giving it a try.",Pleasant Energy,4

They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

It makes my skin soft, and in particular, my feet feels less dry even after just one application.  I think it is better then the moisturing lotions you find in the stores.

"This is my least-favorite flavor of Clif bars, one of my husband's lesser favorites, and my twenty-something daughter's favorite flavor. Clif has a lot of different flavors, however, so there is something for everyone. I switched over from Zone-type meal bars to only this brand a while back because it has much healthier ingredients.<br /><br />This cannot be considered a high-protein bar, because they tend to have 18-20 grams of protein, and this brand has only 9-10 grams of protein per bar.<br /><br />Like all meal bars, this is very condensed food, containing about the same calories as a candy bar of the same size.",Mixed reviews on this flavor from my family,4
"this is a very good litter box for people that live in a small apartment or house, where there isn't much separation between the location of the box and the living area. the topper and flap keep the smell *very* contained, and the sifter makes it really easy to clean and change. my one complaint is that sometimes (and somewhat counterintuitively) the clumping kind of litter will get stuck and clog up the sifter, so it actually works much better (for me) to use the very cheapest *non*-clumping litter i can find. i give this product a 4, rather than 5, star review because the cheap litter is dusty and makes putting new litter into the box sort of annoying. other than that, it's really a great product and has made my cat's presence much more tolerable for my roommate, hehe",best closed litter box i've ever had,4

"My cat absolutely loves his ""fish corks"".  We have to keep them locked in a cabinet or he chews through the bag and eats all of them.  They are about the size of a wine cork.  Foam like texture with tough outer covering.  In theory, biting through the outer covering and squishing into the inner foam is supposed to help keep teeth clean.  Hard to tell if they are effective but I'm too lazy to brush his teeth and figure this is better than nothing.  He is fed Wellness wet food only.  I strongly believe kibble is bad for animal teeth since it doesn't clean their teeth while chewing and all the carbs simply make a nice paste on teeth providing an excellent environment for plaque forming bacteria.  Seriously, would you replace your tooth brush with hard cookies?  Consider the residue from Oreos?  I've seen kibble fed teeth and they aren't pretty.  We've been using this product for a few years.  Our cat is nine years old and finally needed his first professional teeth cleaning earlier this year.  The dental chews have a strong odor and oily residue that sticks to your fingers but easily washes off with simple water and friction.  He attacks and bats them around the floor for a second then devours them quickly.  I usually give him one each day.","Cat loves them, Unsure how effective.",4

"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.",Best sour cream & onion chip I've had,4

"Why oh why do studios stamp ""Deluxe Edition"" on movies and then provide nothing to make it worthy of that title??????  I absolutely LOVE the movie Beetlejuice, and just about anything else Tim Burton has done.  The Blu-ray version of this movie looks and sounds better than any version I've seen before.  The colors are sharp and the sound is greatly improved over other DVD iterations I have seen before.  The movie comes with a nice slipcover featuring the cover art in lenticular motion.  That's about the only really special feature you are going to get on this disc.  With it being the 20th Anniv. of this film, I thought that surely something would have been included about the making of the film, but there is NOTHING.  There is no commentary track, no making of doc., no interviews with the cast.......NOTHING.  Oh you do get 3 episodes of the Beetlejuice cartoon.....yaawwwwnn and the original theatrical trailer.  I'm not complaining too much, because I do love this movie, and it is worth the price just to see it in High Definition.  It just ticks me off a little when studios stamp the ""Deluxe Edition"" on the cover, when there is nothing Deluxe about it.",Great Movie...But NOT Given DELUXE Treatment,4
"For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.",Closest thing to 70s Girl Scout Fudge Patties I've found yet--Keebler Fudge Filled Cookies,4

Always in the market for a cheaper k-cup (and living in San Francisco) I was happy to have stumbled upon the  San Francisco Bay brand. I was worried about the weird shape at first but it still works in the brewer. I like that the packaging is trimmed down so I don't feel as guilty about the environental impact of overpackaging  (told you I live in SF!)  The French Roast is very bold and at first I was unsure...I think I like  it just fine but plan to try another roast next time. It also tastes a bit more acidic than other brands but that isn't such a bad thing either. I think I am getting used to it.

"This coffee is absolutely amazing. Don't get a BLEND do not, do not buy a blend. You're not getting the real thing. I've tried this through the coffee pot (using permanent gold filter) and through french press and it's absolutely wonderful. Sweet, nutty, fruity, everything it's made out to be. worth every penny. Such a wonderful cup of coffee. I usually like mine with cream and sugar and with this cup I didn't need either. Try it black with a small amount of sugar. Excellent. Someone suggested cutting this coffee with Kona. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This coffee doesn't need to be cut by anything. It stands up on its own and if your friends didn't notice any difference in the coffee they were driking you either a) made it wrong, or b) have friends with little to no taste buds.","Yes, yes, and yes.",4
"Earl Grey was one of my favorite flavors before I got into loose leaf tea and I still come back to it on a regular basis. The comforting aroma of bergamot the it's flavor mixed with black tea is hard to beat. Of the many brands of Earl Grey I've tried over the years, H&B's is without a doubt one of the better ones.<br /><br />It rises above an average tea bag in that it can produce a well balanced cup over at least two steepings. Just brew it for a shorter time than recommended on the packaging. For me it is under 2 minutes for the first cup and longer for the second. It mixes well with cream and sugar too, though I prefer mine black. Another plus is it's ability to taste good as a cold tea as well as a hot one. The citrusy bergamot flavor is prominent in this mix so perhaps that is its secret.<br /><br />In any event, quality tea leaves and flavorings are evident here and I would purchase it again. There are better loose leaf tea blends available, but as a bagged tea it is hard to beat.<br /><br />~ Kort",Good Bagged Earl Grey,4
"I've been getting these regularly for a year because I liked the idea of using Splenda as the sweetener.  Just last month it was $15.40.  Now it's $17.81.  That is a price hike of over 15%.

"I've had regular, lychee and now this flavor. I found it to be very bland. I did taste peach and mango but it seems the slightly bitter green coconut water canceled out the sweetness and depth of its two added fruits. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  Naked seems to have the truest green coconuts -- when they're so young the water isn't sweet most of the time. I don't mind the taste and love the benefits of drinking coconut water.

So this can serve as a cost-efficient diet margarita mix for us and that's why we'll likely buy it again.<br /><br />NOTE:  Hubby and I are used to diet stuff... we use Splenda in our tea & coffee and drink diet sodas, so we're accustomed to it.

The vanilla ""flavor infusion"" doesn't overpower; the aroma is absolutely amazing - not flat, with the right amount of depth and complexity.<br /><br />I prepared this coffee drip-style (not in a machine), and found it required a bit more than usual to make the strength I prefer.

However, the only flake or aerated chocolate I've ever had has been European, which of course tastes much different. It was a surprising combination to have this taste exactly like Hershey's but be a totally different texture. I can't say I liked it any better or worse than a standard Hershey bar.

"I like sardines but don't eat them very often...maybe a 15 oz can every year, reason why I gave La Sirena 4 stars instead of 5 because there may be better sardines. Having said that, I am planning of storing food for at least 6 months and sardines seem to be an excellent choice just in case the world goes down the drain (or worst yet, a zombie apocalypse...just kidding).<br /><br />I agree with the other comment about the sardines being firm, I don't think they require extra cooking though, I like them the way they come...that's my taste. But then again, I don't know anything about sardines.<br /><br />La Sirena sardines (15 oz can) provides you with 7 servings:<br />protein: 12g, carbs: 2g, fat: 3g (approx.), and 250mg of sodium.  So the total is:<br />Protein 84g, carbs 14g, fat 21g, and sodium 1750mg. You'll find that the sodium and carbs are in the tomato sauce, so you just can eat the sardines if you cant have the sodium.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care about the high sodium content. In fact, if the world goes down the pipe I'll need anything I can get my hands on. For instance, I can mix the tomato sauce with olive oil and garlic to mix it with pasta. I know, I know, this is not gourmet eating, but when surving is the top priority you will eat what you must.<br /><br />Do I recommend it?

Simply throw some rice into your rice cooker, boil this pre-made curry sauce (with veggies) in boiling water and soon as the rice is done, cut open the packet and pour over your rice!

I like to drink Alo Exposed Aloe Vera Drink, and the consistency of the aloe in this drink is similar.  The added flavor of passion fruit makes this tea more enjoyable.  The flavor is somewhat floral.  I am not bothered by the aloe chunks, and I find this tea quite refreshing.

"This broth is tasty and works well with so many dishes.  However, since my family was used to Swanson, we found recipes that we were used to tasted different.  Although my taste buds are not smart enough to know what the difference was, I assume this comes from the combination of ingredients used to make this broth.  The ingredients are listed here:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic chicken broth (filtered water, organic chicken), Organic chicken flavor, Natural chicken flavor (chicken broth, salt), Organic evaporated cane juice, Autolyzed yeast extract, Organic onion powder, Turmeric, Organic flavor.<br /><br />Going organic I have had to make many adjustments and this is just another one but totally worth it.  In the long run going organic is the best thing for our family and despite tasting different this broth is still delicious.

Those amino-acids contain a large proportion of essential amino-acids, particularly lysine, together with glutamic acid. The Yeast Extracts contain a maximum of 18 % glutamic acid on the basis of the total protein content (total glutamic acid refers to both free glutamic acid and glutamic acid in small peptides).

After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say ""one"" cookie, then ""half"" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth.",Tasty cookie -- even fiance likes it..,4

I have looked for a truly hot chip for some time, and most fall seriously short.  For those not ""appreciative"" of the heat level of these chips, they are overwhelmed with the hot, and say it covers up the taste.  Not for me!  Actually, I could use them somewhat hotter, but they are not a disappointment.  Good heat, great with beer.",Good n hot,4

This is pretty good for a whole bean coffee at a decent price.  I would definitely say that out of the whole flavor line up for the eight o clock brand that this one tastes the best.  It is good enough that it makes you feel good for the amount of money that you spent.  It does not taste burnt or over-roasted like most of the bargain priced coffee and it isn't weak in the flavor department either.  If you do some comparison shopping here on Amazon you will find a pretty decent deal with the subscribe and save program. I would recommend it to friends and family.,Pretty good.,4
"I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a ""supermarket brand"". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.",Coffe shop quality capuccino at home,4

"Overall I thought this would be great but kinda disappointed what I mean is the colors of the flowers were not vibrant they all were kinda green sickly looking plants and only three teas I really liked said they tasted like what they were suppose to, I still haven't tried them all and that's because I don't normally like black teas, I'll be getting to those later in the month. I love the tea pot as my mother in law is always hogging the big metal one, so I place this little pot in the microwave and heat up the water and than have my tea, its quick and easy and the handle keeps me from getting burned. It is smaller than expected since it comes in a pretty big box. It says hassle free packaging but I laughed because getting it open was pretty hard to do. It is dishwasher safe and cleans up easy it is really cute and I love the pot, and it was fun to try something different I do love the tea but If I buy tea again I'm buying the satchel version and not this bulb stuff again as it can only be used two times really. It holds about one cup of tea. If you love tea this was more for personal fun, but overall not for drinking a lot of tea.

"These graham crackers shine as an organic-ish product:  natural ingredients, sustainable packaging & production, etc.  As for the taste, they are good but not great.  And I REALLY wanted to love these crackers.  The oatmeal pieces are a nice touch on the crackers, but they fall away quickly.  Unlike most graham crackers I've eaten in my life, these are on the drier side and will leave you begging for some coffee or milk.  I don't know what's missing?  Maybe a little more honey or whatever else it is that makes graham crackers moist would do the trick.<br /><br />Overall, I don't know that I'd go out of my way to buy these but if I had to choose between others on the shelf this would probably win in a holistic sense.  Others will surely disagree, but I give them the nod of approval.","good, not great",4

"We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that ""baby food"" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U"">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby.","Sweet and a little tart, but delicious and fresh!",4

"The full strength taste of this ginger/lemon drink is too strong for my taste, but diluting it by using half as much of the powder just means it makes twice as many servings.

"I have such a love/hate relationship with licorice, and I had to try this one, I just had to. Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.<br /><br />I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.<br /><br />It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.<br /><br />Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it. I'm one of those who loves it, but my wife is one who hates it. If it's in a tea, she can taste it, and it bothers her. But for me...oh, I love it and this matcha is beautiful in the balance of flavor to matcha. I want to make a large mug of this, but I have other matchas to taste and review!",Licorice?

I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle.

"I was expecting Dove Men + Care Clean body wash to be more ""man"" specific.  It seems like just plain Dove Soap in a bottle.

When Dove Men came out I was thrilled that it would finally be more of the ""man"" soap they want with the  great Dove non itchy soap.  Well, it is definately still the great Dove soap, but it still can't compare with Axe as far as smell. It isn't quite up to the same cologne type smell that Axe or other brands made for men have. I give it 4 stars because Dove is a wonderful soap, and this is a bit more on the manly scent side, but not enough.  Some men don't like a strong smelling soap so this may be great for them, but unfortunately for my guys they want a stronger smelling cologne in their soap.",Just like Dove Bar soap but in a bottle,4

"I refuse to refer to the mushroom in this tea as ""Ganoderma"".  It's Reishi.  It's been Reishi for thousands and thousands of years.  I don't know why the Organo company tried to get all fancy and used a lesser common name for the medicinal mushroom.<br /><br />With that said, onto my review... I like the tea.  I notice beneficial effects of drinking it.  Infused with the Reishi, it seems to sustain the energy you get from the caffeine, rather than a crash and burn I get from other green teas.  I feel the beneficial effects of this tea over a period of sometimes, 3, 4, 5 hours.  It's balanced, easy going energy, and I feel like I do get a slight bit of oxygenation in my body as well.  I can even drink this tea right before bed, and I'll sleep like a baby.<br /><br />The taste... not great.  It does taste like Green Tea, but it tastes like you diluted a normal cup of green tea with 8 oz of water.  It brews very weak.  The color is just an ever so slight tint of green.  It doesn't seem like much even comes out of the bag, and it tastes like it.  I'm assuming since there's the Reishi in there, that's why.  The Reishi actually brews clear, so it would make sense that the tea is a lesser color.<br /><br />All in all, do I think this stuff is worth almost 90 cents per cup?  No.  Certainly not.  I buy bulk organic japanese green tea for literally, 10 cents per tea bag.  So paying 9x that for tea isn't really too appealing.  I'm a big Green Tea drinker.  I usually drink 3 cups a day.  That would be almost $3 per day for this tea.  What I do, to save costs, is buy Reishi tea, and dump that into a cup of green tea for the ultimate cup of tea.<br /><br />Amazon offers Reishi tea (again, which Organo calls Ganoderma)[...], as well as super cheap bulk organic green tea.  Try this recipe -- 1 cup Reishi, mixed with 1 cup of Green Tea.  Put them together in a large cup or thermos, and enjoy.  You're getting the same stuff (more Reishi, actually, which is truly the good stuff) for less than half the cost.","Reishi Green Tea.... overpriced, but good.",4
"These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.

"****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****",Hibiscus and Raspberry--Lovely!,4

This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,<br />""Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate"".","Good hot cocoa mix, but....",4

"I have shoulder-length permed hair. I found that this product didn't do much for frizz, but it does make my hair pleasantly shiny. Only a small amount of oil is needed. My favorite aspect of this product is the applicator tip. You can apply the oil directly to your scalp without having to get your hands oily. While some other reviews complained about the smell, I really didn't notice the scent. I didn't find it unpleasant or too strong. While it's convenient to be able to use this on wet or dry hair, I'd prefer a product that was more effective on frizz. I usually use oil sheen for frizz, shine, and moisture.",CLEAR Scalp & Hair Oil,4

"I love JIF Peanut Butter, especially since it's one of my favorite peanut butters that I grew up with during my childhood years since I used to use it a lot for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, JIF is my 2nd favorite peanut butter in the whole wide world, but PETER PAN is my favorite in the whole wide world, but when I can't find PETER PAN in a 28 OZ or 40 OZ size jar, I end up buying JIF in that size as a 2nd alternative, especially since I can never find PETER PAN in a 28 Ounce or 40 Ounce size at the stores anymore and only carry PETER PAN in the 16 OZ size for some reason which is perhaps due to PETER PAN being outsold by JIF and SKIPPY since I can always find SKIPPY and JIF in a 28 OZ or 40 OZ size at most grocery stores.<br /><br />Additionally, I find it hard to understand why Amazon sells JIF and SKIPPY in a 40 OZ sized jar individually and wont sell PETER PAN in a 40 OZ size individually, plus it baffles me why Amazon charges you $12 bucks to buy this size product online to buy one 40 Ounce jar of JIF when you can buy it at the grocery store or a retail store in this exact same size for under $8 or $9 bucks too.",Jif Rocks!,4

"YUP-these are made in Canada. The company web site says they're based in Preston, Washington in the foothills of the Cascade mountains. All of the ones I've purchased say Made in Canada. So be it.<br />I saw these in my local grocery store. Being naturally curious, I read the ingredients and was elated to find that they use sucrolose, otherwise known as SPLENDA, as their sweetener, not aspartame, which leaves a horrible aftertaste and NO SUGAR ADDED and no carbs or calories. I took a few home and really like these. They are a nice alternative to regular water and the other things I normally drink. They also add a little extra to the meal, being 17 ounces instead of the popular 12 or 16 ounce drinks.<br />Because they are no sugar, no calorie and nicely flavored, I recommend these to anyone who wants a little variety in what they drink without worrying about the sugar. Be sure and check the web-prices are all over the place. I reported to Amazon a cheaper price on another web site and they lowered the price within a few weeks. They also come in 12 and 18 packs AND in single- and variety-packs. My preference is the orange mango, black raspberry and kiwi strawberry. I have so far been unable to find the coconut pineapple, lemonade and lemon lime flavors but am still looking.",A Great Grocery Product From Canada,4

"I have never used something like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V7XNRQ"">Coconut Manna - 15 oz - Container</a> before, so it's all new to me. I didn't try it on toast or bread or make a smoothie with it. Here's how I used it - I used some of this to replace the face in a  vanilla cake and brownies.<br />It worked well for the cake, gave it a slightly coconut flavor, but not very distinctive. The vanilla cake tasted very rich with the substitution. The brownies, I substituted 1/3 of the fat in the brownie recipe for the equal amount of coconut manna. Again, it worked very well, producing a rich flavored brownie with a slightly different flavor, but it was not a distinctive coconut flavor. I would say I'd probably have to substitute 1/2 the amount of fat with the coconut manna to get a coconut flavor. But that experiment will wait for a little longer.<br />You can also use this product on your skin, if you choose to - it makes skin incredibly smooth. You can use it on your hair. It's not an overwhelming coconut smell, just a good clean smell.<br />I only gave this 4 stars simply because there are no sort of instructions with the package. There's no info on making a smoothie or anything like that. There are no directions on how to use this product in baking or cooking. I did search on the interweb, but really did not find out much information.<br /><br />But, if you are the sort of person who is using this type of product, you definitely should buy it - you probably have dozens of recipes for coconut manna.<br />As for me, I intend to keep experimenting by baking with it. I'm thinking maybe chocolate chop cookies, with the coconut manna taking the place of the fat. Or maybe use it to make a coconut cake or icing. I do enjoy this but unfortunately I don't get a lot of time to experiment with baking, just on the weekend. But the holidays are coming up and I plan to add a little bit of coconut manna goodness to my holiday baking. It should be fun.",fun to experiment with,4
"My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as ""inspected for human consumption"". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.",Perfect as an occasional supplement!,4

"I wasn't sure what to expect of this energy-drink powder. The list of ingredients looked promising, at least, so worth a try.<br /><br />I poured it into a water goblet, added a little water and *foom*, it foamed up, almost overflowing the glass. After a short while it settled down and I was able to fill the rest of the glass with water, producing this gorgeously colored shocking fuchsia beverage. The pictures in the product listing do not do it justice.<br /><br />The taste was... well, kind of meh. Strong notes of caffeine and vitamin, slightly tart, and sweetened primarily with stevia, which has its own weird aftertaste. (I like it, but I'm strange that way.)<br /><br />The energy lift was gentle, pleasant, and lasted for a few hours. The single-serving sample I got for review was free, but after I tried it I intended to buy more... until I saw the price, at over a dollar per packet!

"This afternoon I had a Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup of the Spicy Chicken variety. It's a quick lunch (four minutes) and quite tasty. My only gripes would be that it's too high in sodium, a complaint shared by almost all noodle bowls, and that it doesn't have enough protein for a good meal. I can easily add the latter. I also had a big Delicious Apple to supply something fresh and something with a lot of fiber.

"Ballerina are definitely my favourite cookies. I agree with the other reviewer. They are ridiculously delicious and virtually impossible to share! You just *want* the entire package for yourself.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, I was so addicted to Ballerina and their sister cookies Singoalla that I could eat one package of each instead of supper. I readily admit that my stomach said ""no"" to that particular guilty pleasure, so these days I avoid Ballerina, not because they are bad, but for the same reason you avoid a Femme Fatale.<br /><br />Ballerina are chocolate cookies, and my only complaint is that the chocolate tends to melt, making the cookies a somewhat messy experience...unless you devour them really fast! They might give an entirely new meaning to the expression ""a quick snack"". Also, the cookie really gets stuck to your teeth, so don't forget a tootbrush if you're planning to eat these.<br /><br />The other flavour, Singoalla, is raspberry + vanilla, and doesn't melt.<br /><br />Personally, I recommend both.

"These are crisp cookies with berries sprinkled through the cookie.  Not like the Newtons Fruit Crisps, or regular Newtons, which have a layer of fruit pur&eacute;e.  The cookie is 2.5 inches wide and about an eighth of an inch thick.<br /><br />I rarely buy packaged cookies, so I don't have a lot of points of comparison.  The texture of the cookie reminds me a little of a graham cracker, only denser.  There is a strong scent of blueberry and a distinct flavor of dried blueberries.  They are not very sweet, which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />They'd be tasty spread with a little soft mild cheese or peanut butter.  On their own, they're good; just not knock-your-socks-off good.  More of a pleasant snack.  It occurs to me, though, that they'd make an interesting pie crust; similar to the kind you make by crushing graham crackers or chocolate wafers and mixing with butter.  I'm thinking they could be very nice in a pie crust with a vanilla pudding filling.<br /><br />Here's the nutritional scoop:  There are three cookies in a serving size, which results in 140 calories, 5 grams of fat (1g saturated, 3g polyunsaturated, 1g monounsaturated), 90 mg of sodium, 50g of potassium, 21g total carbs, 2g dietary fiber, 8g sugars and 2g protein.  Not too bad as a snack from the nutritional standpoint, at least by comparison to most cookies.  From the ingredient list, they appear to be vegan.  Also, they are sweetened with brown sugar, not high fructose corn syrup.  They do contain wheat and soy products.<br /><br />I'd say go for it if you're looking for a packaged cookie that's on the healthier side.",A grownup's cookie,4

So, I guess that's not too bad. The only thing is because of this granola's small size, it will be tempting to have more then one!<br /><br />Though, I did notice that just one small bar has 7 grams of sugar.

"This coffee is ""100% responsibly grown, ethically traded.""  Sounds good, although I'd rather them have it certified Fair Trade and organic.  But they're on the right track.<br /><br />Before I got my free bag of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I'd been using various organic brands of espresso roast or french roast ground beans for my iced mocha every morning.  Chocolate syrup + 2 shots of espresso + milk + ice = a very tasty coffee.  And that coffee and chocolate taste was good.<br /><br />Once the vanilla natural fusions arrived, I used it in my normal iced mocha.  It tasted a little off at first.  I wasn't used to the vanilla taste.  And there IS a vanilla taste.  And smell.  It's a really pleasant, delicious vanilla, actually.  Once I got used to it, I really like the addition of the vanilla to my concoction.  That bag was quickly used up, and I went back to the half-used regular coffee bag.  I quickly decided to buy another bag of the vanilla natural fusions next time coffee was on my shopping list. :]<br /><br />And yeah, it is nice that you can bring in the empty bag for a tall brewed coffee at any Starbucks.","Great taste, wish it were organic and fair trade",4

"I grabbed these for a light lunch while our office fridge wasn't working. I was happy to see there are only 280 calories in the whole can for 6 of these. They are very tangy, which I like, and the leaves are soft and not stringy. The texture of the rice is a little mushy, but it's pretty good considering it sits in a can for so long. Two cons, one is that the lid is not easy to pop off. I didn't have a can opener and almost broke the pop top thing. So if you don't have access to a can opener, these might be a problem. The other con is that one of the oils in here solidified making these look very unappealing. But they taste good, so that's really all that matters. There is no fruit or anything in these, it's just the grape leaves stuffed with tangy rice.

"I gave this four stars based on the flavor (according to my own taste preference of course) but I would give ten stars to the aroma!  It fills the kitchen with such a wonderful scent.  Back to the flavor though, it's a gentle pecan taste with a just under medium roast flavor.  So to many I believe it would be considered weak.  You could brew a smaller cup or more likely if you like your coffee strong, you probably are not looking at this product anyway!  If you are looking for strong order a variety that is bold or extra bold.  I like to have a variety of K cups without paying the sampler pack prices and this fits the bill for my home.

"I order this from Amazon and a hugely discounted price. In my area it is $29.99 for a 23.2l one can, which is nuts. When I first subscribed I was only paying $74.97 for 4 cans.  That's around 45 dollars in savings, I got 3 shipments at that discounted price, and that's $135 in savings. Now I pay around $86 which is still a lot cheaper than going to the store. Plus only Toy r' us sells it where we live, and that's not exactly close to me. So that's why this product gets 4 stars.<br /><br />I would have given it only 3 but the savings are great. To start off my son does love this formula over any other. We ran out once before the next shipment, and Toys r' us was closed so we had to get another brand, my son wouldn't even drink it. Now some of you are gonna say that's because it's not what he is used to.  Well we actually started him off on Enfamil, but due to corn syrup being the first ingredient in the formula we switched (not because it's corn syrup, but because I don't want my son's primary diet to be based off of any sugar).  Well when we switched that time he didn't even care. Also this kid eats a lot. He is a big boy, lol... The doctor says he is a healthy weight so whatevsky.<br /><br />The reasons I don't care for the formula.  First of all it seems like his bowel movements aren't as regular.  Also as soon as we switched his BM's turned more solid and smell inhuman. His stomach does get really tight and it seems like he has a hard time pushing his poopies out because it's so solid.  Before his stomach would get really tight but then it would just gush out, oh the joys of parenthood.  After talking to the doctor there apparently is nothing to concern ourselves about.  Secondly I wish they would offer this in a 6 pack, as 4 will not last the entire month anymore.  We end up having to buy 1 can locally towards the end of the month which at 86 dollars a shipment basically means the money we saved just goes towards 1 can. Other than that I think this formula is fine, and our son loves it very much. He would rate it a 5 and write ""MMM"" 20 times in the review. :)","My son loves it, i'm pretty sure I do too..",4

"I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.",Pretty Damn Good Jerky,4

I feel bad for the previous reviewer - maybe it was an error on La Choy's part? Each box we've ever purchased come with each cookie individually wrapped.

"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.","Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor",4

"I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon.<br /><br />My favorite packaged coconut water in order of best tasting was Zico, One, then Vita Coco.  Unfortunately Zico decided to changed their formula and based on what others who have tried the old and the new have said, I will pass on that.  I decided to give this particular brand a chance and the taste is okay and priced reasonably.

"I have been chasing that perfect cup for some time now, lately through Amazon by buying and splitting the bags with a neighbor. I use a press, the neighbor goes drip. The first bag of this Sumatra was the best consumer coffee that either of us had ever found.  It shipped to us extremely fresh, still working off gas in the bag and foaming in my press pot.  The aroma from the bag was strong and wonderful and it carried through to the press and into the cup. Bag #1 was easily the best coffee either of us had ever brewed.<br /><br />The second bag was quite a disappointment, not stale but also not really fresh, with only marginal aroma in the bag and not even recognizable as coffee in the cup.  However, even at that the flavor still matched up close to our previous best finds here at Amazon- about the Fogbuster level.  We decided to give it another try, and bag #3 was somewhere in between, but still only a pretender when compared to that first bag.<br /><br />One interesting thing about this coffee, which I have experienced with no other:  I am single and make a press first thing in the morning. Then (coffee connoisseurs stop reading now) warm additional cups up in the microwave as the morning goes on.  Something about this coffee takes the microwave rewarming far, far better than any other coffee I have ever used.  I don't understand why, but it does- all the way into the evening if need be (OK, I'll admit it, sometimes even overnight).  Single guy, what can I say, but that is a significant bonus for me.<br /><br />My shipments come from Lexington, KY.  I assume Amazon has warehouses around the country.  Part of my fresh/not-so-fresh problem might be due to the volume consideration and turnaround at that particular warehouse. We have decided to give the Sumatra one more try but I feel we will more than likely be moving along after bag #4.  I'll let you know how it goes.","A bit ""Hit or Miss""",4
"The blend is beautiful, flavorful and gives of an incredibly fresh and strong pepper scent when ground. The difference between these corns and those bought in a typical supermarket was evident. I was pleased there were almost no broken corns or husk flakes in the bag.  The packaging needs to be rethought, though.  The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that isn't really user friendly.  Something self sealing would be preferable.  If you try and tear off a corner on this bag, the cellophane doesn't want to stop tearing when you do.  Scissors are the best way to open and you'll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder.  I'll certainly be purchasing these again.",How pepper should be,4

It's great for work, you can take it with some rice and bam lunch in about two minutes.<br /><br />It does not take long to heat this item because it's already at room temperature, anything over a minute is pushing it.

"I've tried several of the Alo Coco drinks.  I really only have two complaints.  The first is obviously the pulp.  I have to strain the pulp in order to be able to drink it.  That's a personal preference, though.  I can't drink orange juice with pulp, either.<br /><br />The other negative isn't really a negative but needs to be mentioned nonetheless.  All of the Alo Coco drinks taste about the same to me.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I love the coconut flavor, and I love the fact that I can simply shop for whichever is the least expensive.<br /><br />The biggest positive, though, is the hydration quality of the drink.  It is high in potassium, an electrolyte, and I have found that I only need to drink about half of the water as normal while excercising when I have a half bottle of Alo Coco before and the other half after.  It's a great alternative to Gatorade, and for that reason alone, I will continue to purchase Alo Coco.",Only negative is the pulp,4

"I like the flavor of good coffee. I do not bother with coffee that is less than tasty.  Now when it comes to getting protein in, that has been a challenge.  Most protein powders have a terrible taste and smell to them making it less than desireable to drink.  With Click Mocha, I add it to a cup of milk, half cup of water, ice cubes into a blender shaker bottle with a scoop of protein powder (such as EAS or Syntrax Chocolate or vanilla) and one Click scoop of Click - two scoops is a serving.  Shake it up and go, this is my morning routine every single morning. And I do mean every single morning.  I am NOT a breakfast eater, so this helps me get some protein in and lasts me until I'm either ready to eat breakfast or lunch depending on the time.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is not strong in the mocha,  so I do add some instant decaf espresso ( I try to limit my caffine daily, if your not limiting your caffine then add leaded instant espresso) Bustello is my decaf instant espresso of choice and is more economical than Starbucks Decaf Via (Got a box of this for my birthday so I have tried using half a serving and still get AWESOME coffee flavor)<br /><br />If I just want a little afternoon pick up, I will use cold brewed coffee and add some milk and a half a scoop of click to make my iced coffee creamier.

"This is the first time I've tried a microwaveable pasta product, and I found it to be quite good. The sauce was indeed spicy (I love spicy) and the flavor, while not quite as good as something you'd buy in a jar, was better than I expected. I liked the pasta, too. This isn't something I'd have regularly at home (I'd prefer to just cook pasta) but wouldn't mind eating regularly at work or some other place. I can see myself stocking up on a few.<br /><br />However, use extreme care when preparing. I followed the preparation instructions on the package and managed to give myself a first-degree burn. One side of the tray contains a removable sauce cup, the other the pasta. The idea is to peel back the cover a tad (for ventilation), microwave the food, then peel back the cover from the sauce cup and tray and dump the sauce on the pasta. Since the cover is stuck on the sauce cup there is a place to hold the sauce cup with your thumb while removing the cover.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cover adheres very well to the sauce cup. When trying to remove the cover my thumb slipped and hot pasta sauce dumped all over my right hand, resulting in a burn. Next time I think I'll peel back the cover to expose the sauce cup completely, and then put the cover back down and hold it in place with a small microwave-safe bowl while microwaving.","Tastes great, but use care when preparing",4
"Don't count on this to keep you awake because of its caffeine content.  If anything, you might get a sugar high.  ""Instant coffee"" is the fifth ingredient after ""sugar,"" ""non-dairy creamer,"" ""maltodextrin"" and ""cocoa.""  In fact, it tastes much more like a specialty cocoa than it does a coffee.

Nine grams of sugar.<br /><br />As with many hot-mix-type beverages, recommends 6 oz of milk or water per 4 tsp of product.

"Ito En Sencha Shot is a very decent product and a nice departure from the current run of energy drinks. Following the wildfire success of Red Bull, company after company has come up with energy drinks involving high concentrations of caffeine and taurine. Caffeine has known long-term effects on health, while taurine has barely been studied.<br /><br />Sencha Shot is a refreshing departure from the common approach to sports/energy drinks. Instead of loading it with strange things that produce a big lift in the drinker's feelings of overall physical energy, Sencha shot takes a milder and much more sensible approach giving the drinker a quick dose of chilled green tea with some vitamin C added, offering the *positive* health effects of the green tea's antioxidant properties. To put that another way, in comparison with other ""proper"" energy drinks like Red Bull, Amp, MDX, Rock Star etc, etc, drinking Sencha Shot is a lot less like getting hit with a hammer.<br /><br />Now it's true that you could for all intents and purposes get all the effects of Sencha Shot by brewing a big pot of decent-quality green tea, and then eating an orange, but it wouldn't be portable and you'd look very strange if you offered it to someone.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the most I can tell you about it is that I like it. It's good and good for you and it's not expensive. In fact, when bought by the case, on a per-can basis, it costs around half what Starbuck's doubleshot espresso does and there's not a thing wrong with it.

Some people made it sound horrific. I wish they were not so high in saturated fats, thats my only complaint about this but nothing the manufacturer can do, that's the product. 7 grams of saturated fat is ALOT per ounce.

"I choose to follow a gluten-free, dairy-free diet because I have multiple sclerosis.  This product enables me to have my ""sweets"" without the consequences.

The consistency is slightly moist, compact, heavy; the flavor is not overly sweet, peanut butter-y and fun (it's the only way I can describe it) when you get the chocolate chip.  If the bars had any more chips, they would overpower it.  I only wish it was a wee bit larger.  Just a wee bit because I go through three to four boxes every month.",Great for Snack Attack!,4

However, it does not taste like lemon. It sweetens really well, better than expected. However, you cannot taste the lemon in it at all. I will still buy liquid Stevia in the future since it works but will be leery about trying any `flavored' ones.","Great for sweetening, not for lemon flavor",4

"I still prefer grinding my own whole bean coffee, but for a pre-ground, flavored coffee, this is probably the best I have had. The vanilla flavor is just right, not too over powering like many flavored coffees. Instead it has just the right level of vanilla.

"First of all, this is not strictly dry dog food...there are chewy pieces, which turned my dogs into ravenous maniacs.<br /><br />I have two small dogs that weigh 10 lbs and 13 lbs; we keep a full dog feeder in the kitchen, so they can eat as much as they want, whenever they want. They are light eaters; they are in excellent physical condition, and we only feed them dry dog food (no soft food at all) and the occasional dog biscuit. We never had a problem with this arrangement in the fourteen years that we've had our dogs.<br /><br />I made the mistake of pouring some of this dog food into the feeder before it was completely empty. The dogs systematically tossed the old dog food pieces out of the feeder dish onto my floor. Then they started plucking out the chewy pieces, although they do seem to enjoy all the morsels...they just want to eat their favorite pieces first.<br /><br />As a result of their enthusiasm for the Purina Beneful, I swear they have pooped more in the past week than they have in the past year. Luckily, they did not develop diarhea (sp?) from the diet change.<br /><br />Obviously, my dogs love it, but I will not be leaving it in the feeder...we will have to switch to measured meals at specific times.<br /><br />On a side note: the resealable bag is not spillproof.

"I recently decided to give these Diedrich K-Cups a whirl.  For years, I've been a dedicated Green Mountain Coffee Roaster customer, and their K-Cup varieties are excellent; however, even at their ""Cafe Express"" discount rate, their coffees are more expensive by several dollars per 25 count pack than the current price Amazon is offering on Diedrich blends.<br /><br />I'd been traveling in Southern California a few months ago and tried some Diedrich coffees then.  Although the coffees I tried tended to exhibit the Starbucks/West Coast tendency to roast beans too darkly -- to the point of effacing some of the original regional characteristics of the beans -- they are fine for dark roasts and preferable to what I've had from Starbucks.  Coupled with the Keurig brewer, this makes for a decent cup of medium-to-dark ""West Coast"" style coffee.",Good K-Cup Coffee on the darker side,4
"For those who have never tried Popchips before, they are not exactly a normal potato chip.  Popchips are air popped rather than fried.  They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just ""different"" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",Great flavor,4

"To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor.",Great on a cut...value not so much,4

"****<br /><br />You have to take this product, Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6), for what it is.  It is not a Pop-Tart, which is bigger and more thoroughly filled with the fruit-like substance these two food-chunks offer.<br /><br />The product under review is airy, more like a small Nerf ball than a large marble, although it is in no way spherical or useful in any games.  I was surprised that the filling did not fill the shell.<br /><br />Because the filling does not fill much of the shell much of the shell does not abut anything that's more liquid than solid, like blueberry jam compared to blueberry paste.<br /><br />****<br /><br />CRUMBLY<br /><br />Because of that much of the shell is so dry that when you take a bite of the top of it it tends to crumble rather than tear, more like a potato chip than a potao knish.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that the typical consumer of this product cannot eventually figure out the exact measures necessary to figuring out how to eat it without spilling crumbles but I am saying there's a reason you don't see the manufacturer, Quaker, bragging all the time on how many thousands of these bars they have shipped to the International Space Station over the years where I'm pretty sure weigthlessness and the susceptibility to encroachement by crumbits into the various electronic and mechanical devices is considered more dangerous than that same degree of encroachment in the backseat of your car.<br /><br />Or even the front seat.<br /><br />****<br /><br />PACKAGING<br /><br />The package of my Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6) is interesting.  When viewed from above, the shape is not a rectangle as you would expect.  Said another way, the horizontal cross-section of the box of almost every such product, and literally millions of others, is a rectangle whereas the cross-section of this box is a parallelogram, i.e., the opposite sides are parallel but the corners are not square.<br /><br />Below is my best representation of a parallelogram, where you should observe the only the stars and not the dots, but it might not turn out right in the final version of this Amazon review.  If it doesn't ignore it.<br /><br />**********<br />.*...............*<br />..*...............*<br />...*...............*<br />....**********<br /><br />This is interesting because the curious mind wants to know why this package is different from so many others.  There must be a reason the experienced and highly paid people at Quaker made such an unusual decision.  I claim it's for one of two reasons, but it if you learn that it's for some other reason, I hope you'll take the ime to leave a comment.<br /><br />It's either because the package's odd shape was expected somehow to attract more buyers than if it were rectangular or because the shape somehow protects the bars inside from getting crushed as much during packaging and transport and shipping.<br /><br />I think it's the latter, because when the box is on a shelf in a store it looks from the front like all the others.  Not until you see it from the side or the top do you realize it's not rectangular as, as I say, so many other of its shelfmates are.<br /><br />I am not enough of an engineer to undertand exactly why this parallelogram shape would prevent the individual bars from getting crushed from the bottom big surface up more significantly or from the top big surface down more significantly but I'm convinced that's the best explanation.<br /><br />****<br /><br />This product did pass my hungry-dog test in the sense that PheyeG'hdeaux ate every little crumb or chunk I dropped onto the floor where he eagerly watched me eat the bar.  My dog is always really quite extremely eager to eat anything that might possibly be food.  He will happily partake of cat poop and dead squirrel and even broasted plamplams.  It's not much to say that this food product, Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6), passes this test, but the fact remains that it does.<br /><br />It probably also goes without saying, but when you duct-tape one of these bars to a stick of dynamite and detonate it, the bar is entirely disintegrated and no identifiable pieces remain within a radius of 10 yards, including any blueberries.<br /><br />Despite my curiosity about and possible admiration for the box's shape, I award this product only 4 stars, and the reason is its flatulence, by which I mean how flat the filling is relative to the higher top crust of the bar.  If you want this ""crispy"" this is it, but I don't.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Update of August 10, 2012<br /><br />Bernadettes's comment got me to thinking there's more to say about the box's extremely uncommon shape.<br /><br />One thing is that storing it next to more normally shaped containers in a pantry is slightly more difficult.<br /><br />More interesting is that this box has a shape that is perhaps better suited for stowing in, say, a backpack.  The height cannot be changed, of course, but if you turn a rectangular prism into this parallelogram you do add to the width (the side to side dimension) but you can shrink the depth (the front to back dimension) significantly, which might well make it fit more easily into certain containers such as a backpack or a motorcycle saddlebag or your kangaroo's pouch.<br /><br />And yet another reason is that this shape prevents storing the box on either of its two sides, which is the one orientation of the three that would be most likely to crush the bars inside which, as I've already said, would result in significant damage to them.  If you store the box flat on either large surface or on either end, the damage will be less.  I don't know that this is the manufacturer's reason, but it makes sense either way.<br /><br />If you can invent yet another reason the box is shaped this way, do leave a comment.",Crumbly dome,4

"""... organic dark chocolate chips (organic sugar, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin added as an emulsifier, organic vanilla) ..."" - from the ingredients list, BOBO'S OAT BARS, CHOCOLATE<br /><br />Several weeks ago, I reviewed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714"">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>, to which I awarded four stars based on its excellent oat flavor and ""mouth feel."" However, it suffered the loss of a fifth star because ""the ostensible banana taste was so subtle as to be virtually non-existent.""<br /><br />Because I love chocolate, I decided to give Bobo another shot with the chocolate version of her oat snack.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is on the bar's ingredients list - as chips, no less. Buts it's a complete mystery to me where the essence of chocolate is lurking. Moreover, there isn't a chocolate chip in sight; I pulled the bar apart and examined it carefully. Granted, the bar has a darker shade of color than the other ones of the brand I've tried, so that at least implies chocolate is present. And, there's a faint nuance of some other flavor underlying the taste of oats, but, if anything, it's suggestive of molasses.<br /><br />Mind you, I truly like these bars for the reasons previously stated. And I'll be sure to enjoy the remaining eleven of the dozen ""chocolate"" ones I purchased. But, as near as I can determine to date with the three types I've eaten, to claim there's any flavor present other than that of oats is a complete fiction and I've had to resist the impulse to award three stars or less for blatantly false advertising.",It's a mystery (with just a hint of flim-flam),4

They reminded me more of a candy bar, maybe because of the layer of peanut butter on the bottom.  I kept the wrapper on while eating it (rolling it down as needed), avoiding any sticky hands or mess.  I'd recommend this as a filling snack that's easy to keep in your purse or backpack.  It didn't earn 5 stars because though it's made of whole grain oats, it also has a bunch of  oils and fructose (which is probably why it actually tastes good).",Pretty tasty even if you're not a granola fan,4

"First, a couple of minor negatives with these cookies.<br /><br />First is the name. For years Nabisco advertised, ""A cookie is just a cookie, but Newtons are fruit and cake."" Why the Nabisco marketing gurus would think that it was a good idea to associate the ""Newtons"" name with these thin, crisp cookies is beyond me.<br /><br />Next is the packaging. The trend today is toward recycled-content paperboard packaging, such as the one Nabisco used for their new <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LA1LKI"">Ritz Crackerful Multigrain Crackers</a>. These cookies come in a foil-lined bag with a plastic liner, neither of which can be recycled.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are quite good. They have a light texture similar to that of a shortbread or butter cookie. There is a nice light sweet flavor that is not overpowering. As is often the case when you use dried fruit in a cookie, the fig bits are a tad hard and chewy. I thought these go best with a beverage. Tea, coffee, soft drink, and even (according to Mrs. Boilermate), wine.

"I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: ""10 bars"" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars.

"I must not be enough of a salt afficionado to be able to tell the difference in taste between this and regular sea salt.  It looks marvelous in a salt grinder ball, but other than that, it tastes like salt.  I gave it as a gift to my husband along with a couple of other varieties and a grinder and he was pleased, mostly for the visual appeal.<br />I would have given a 5 if I had been able to discern any difference in flavor with this on my food.",Interesting - if only for the color,4

"Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss.  Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.  Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency.  I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven.  The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste.  1, Sodium.  This is to be expected with most salad dressings.  If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on.  This isn't the case.  2, Price.  The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages.<br /><br />If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it.  If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out.",Suprisingly good.,4

"Clear Men Scalp Therapy has the same ingredient as Head and Shoulders for dandruff control, Zinc pyrithione, and the ingredients from Paul Mitchell Tea Tree, menthol and ginger. However this product has a weaker mixture of the two, so you do not get the same dandruff control of Head and Shoulders and the tingling clean feeling of Tea Tree.<br /><br />I have jet black hair and once a friend who was in beauty school needed a victim...I mean a volunteer to do a hair coloring. Well I got a real good chemical burn on my scalp and had to go to a dermatologist. She told me that for scalp treatment the over the counter brands contain the following: Head and Shoulders: Zinc pyrithione, Selsun Blue:Selenium sulfide, and T-Gel:coal tar. These are the most common anti dandruff shampoos and there are store brands of each one. She prescribed for me Nizoral Shampoo which has Ketoconazole as the active ingredient. Since then there is a non-prescription version of Nizoral for sale at stores.<br /><br />So, as far as this product goes, it will be good as a mild scalp conditioner and hydrator, but if you have serious scalp issues then the Nizoral is the best of all brands on the shelf. If you are looking for a shampoo that really leaves your scalp tingling and cool feeling then Paul Mitchell Tea Tree is what you should use. This product is fine if you are looking for something that has the mild qualities of those shampoos. It does leave you with a nice clean feeling and the price is reasonable.",Weaker mixture of Head and Shoulders and Tea Tree,4

"****<br /><br />Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:<br /><br />AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter<br /><br />CALM:  nice chamomile tea<br /><br />CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine<br /><br />CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no ""natural flavorings""<br /><br />DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine<br /><br />EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience<br /><br />LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's<br /><br />PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious<br /><br />WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps<br /><br />ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea<br /><br />Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only ""real"" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br /><br />****","Good Teas Overall, But Tazo Disappoints",4

"Im not a coffee connoisseur at all and cant tell the difference between harbucks or mcdowels, but I do know the taste of ca phe sua da in socal and have been casually engaged in finding the right blend.  The oft recommended, Cafe du Monde, is definitely not the flavor.  Im not sure what chicory is, but its a funny tasting coffee, fairly mild, and no matter how long I try to filter it to get it stronger/darker, the coffee just isnt the right amount of blackness.  So I turned to Trung Nguyen, and based on recommendations from internet, friends, and the website itself, this is one of (if not the) most popular blend.  Its got a great flavor full of nuttiness and sure presses better than du Monde (almost no grounds at bottom of cup), but its still not the ca phe sua da Im used to.  For one, the color is a definite brown, not black and it isnt strong.  Ill give the Creative #1 a try which says its a dark and strong robusta coffee (no blend), compared to this which is a blend of nearly everything.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great tasting coffee full of complex flavors that are beyond what I can describe, give this a try... you wont be disappointed to the least.  But, if you are looking for that really strong, jet black coffee that can strip paint off a car and wake up dirt, and that when mixed with condensed milk turns into a rich golden-brown concoction that is ca phe sua da, then you need to look elsewhere (like that Creative #1... possibly).","great coffee, but not the flavor Im looking for for ca phe sua da",4
"My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...",My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!,4

"I was expecting this to be a bit spicier than it is.  I won't go as far as saying it's bland, but it tastes a bit like a spicy ranch dressing.  The bottle describes it as being bold and creamy; creamy yes, but bold... not so much.  Nonetheless, it's a refreshingly unique taste and I found myself using it on a variety of foods.

"The pasta and sauce are separately packaged with the dry pasta in the bottom plastic container and the sauce in an inner container above the pasta.  The top is perforated, with a plastic film covering the holes.  You tear off the plastic film, remove the sauce, fill with water, and nuke.  So far so good.  Drain the pasta, heat the sauce for a very short time (30 sec.), mix and eat.<br /><br />The sauce is surprisingly good - like a jarred meat sauce, but with actual meat in it (or at least, something that resembles meat closely enough).  It has a small amount of spice to it - this isn't something I would serve to small children, just larger kids and grown ups.<br /><br />The drawbacks to this dish are that the pasta is coated with a bit of oil that I was unable to avoid - once done, I felt like I needed to wash my hands - I think it was mostly from the draining step.  Finally, there are two plastic containers included in this.  One of them does have a reusable plastic top, but it has holes in it.  I suppose you could tape up the holes, or use it store things you might want to air a bit (like cheese).  Otherwise, you are tossing a good bit of plastic.  Both containers are marked '5' recyclable, so perhaps you can recycle them where you live.","Tastes good, but a bit messy and wasteful",4
"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.","Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it",4

"My little one was 14 months and below the 3rd percentile.  I nursed him and strictly limited my diet to accomodate his severe allergies to dairy, soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, corn etc.  The time came where I just couldn't handle the limited diet any longer (and cooking of 3 separate meals for he and I, a vegetarian husband, and three other kids all three times a day).  So I decided to wean.  My little guy couldn't have many of the rice milks which were devoid of protein and all the formulas (even the terrible poisonous Neocate) had something he couldn't have. Then I found Toddler Health--a God send!!!  The taste is honestly strange and pretty repulsive at times (he refuses it as a drink) but I'm able to get him to eat half a scoop of it in a bowl of oatmeal daily mixed in rice milk and homemade oat cakes as well.

It is not anywhere comparable to the real thing, but when you consider the calories you save... it is quite good.  I bought mine at Walmart online, but it is also available in many Walmart stores.  I have recently started the HCG diet.  This is an iffy choice while on the 500-cal per day portion of the diet, according to the reading material I have found.  It hasn't hurt my weight loss so far.  I only use 1-2 tbsp. in any given meal.

"Overall, Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat clusters with Flax Seeds Granola has a very satisfying crunch while also being flavorful and healthy.  The granola clusters are nicely sized without being too ""crumbly"" or too hard.  They give a nice satisfying crunch even after sitting in milk for a bit and are a great accompaniment to yogurt.  I only wish that the cinnamon was a bit stronger in flavor, but the overall balance of flavors is quite satisfactory.<br /><br />What I like best is that you feel satisfied after eating a serving of this granola and are not hungry within the next hour or two like you are with some other granola brands.",Healthy While Great-Tasting and Crunchy,4

"I was hesitant to buy a larger bottle at first because I had read some reviews regarding a clear bottle and a decrease in quality from OliveNation, so I bought the smallest container to try it out. I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol- normally an pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.<br /><br />Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a lovely hint of lemon.<br /><br />The only con about this item is that it is very subtle. I need to add what seems to me to be a lot of extract to get the dominate lemon flavor in things like lemon poppy seed muffins.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh lemon juice. This makes an excellent substitution.",Great Extract with Lovely Lemon Flavor,4

"I have been purchasing Reese Skinless & Boneless sardines for several months. These sardines come neatly packed approximately 5 to a can. They have always tasted fresh with no fishy taste. As an added bonus they are low in sodium, only 45mg/can. Most canned sardines are high in sodium. The sardines are good eaten right from the can or in a sandwich with tomatoes or scallions. Sometimes I add a small amount of olive oil as the fish can be a tad dry. Excellent sardines.

Those from Morocco have of late been over cooked and bits and pieces while the ones from Portugal are firm whole pieces.",Lo Sodium Sardines,4

Now it is so difficult going across the border to get the tea so I tried and finally found one that satisfied my taste in this Tetley product.  If you are a tea drinker I think this one is so full of flavor and so close to the Canadian Red Rose you will enjoy it as I do.<br /><br />I noticed Amazon also sells the Canadian Red Rose but they are out of it, when it returns I will order a full supply for myself.

"These squares aren't very big -- about 2 and a half inches wide -- but they're very dense. The 12-count box is heavy! And they pack a lot of flavor into a small space. When you unwrap one of these, you're hit by a rich orange aroma. The texture is chewy. These squares are meant to be savored, not wolfed down. I like that this company's products are vegan and they're made from a short list of simple, natural ingredients. But if you don't like sesame, you will not like these squares.

"Indeed, I had no clusters in my shipment, just a few clumps in a sea of grains.  Not deterred, I really liked the flavor of the product.  It echoes the quality and general flavor of other Kind offerings.  Its texture is a little more brittle-like than I prefer in granola, which seems to contribute to it being very sweet and candy-like.  This is the one factor that would keep me from enjoying it regularly.  The flavor of the grains is very nice, though the blueberry could come through a bit more.<br /><br />The inclusion of whole flax seeds is a bit distressing, however.  Whole flax seeds are hard to chew, which when factored into being indigestible would seem that their health benefit is somewhat lost.  Generally speaking, this granola is a tasty treat, though not something I could keep as a staple in the pantry.",Yum,4

"First thing you notice when you stir up the cup of cereal with the requisite water is that there are whole raspberries in there, not just raspberry flavoring or bits. Real fruit. Nice.<br /><br />I cooked it a bit longer (10 seconds) than the suggested time (1 minute, 45 seconds), and I let it sit three minutes. It came out fine. The texture is nice--you have real chewability here. Not mush. Real bite. And the sweetness is great for adults--not cloying, unlike cereals would appeal more to kids.<br /><br />The size is quite generous. In fact, I wish it was a bit smaller size, honestly. It's 300 calories for the whole cup (8 grams of fiber total). I find that I eat 2/3 of it and am fine.

No idea how that works, any cookies or brownies I've made need milk, oil, eggs, SOMETHING.<br /><br />Regardless, it works well. Tastes pretty darn good, too. It's more of a cake type of a cookie than a real cookie but it still tastes good which is the main point, right?<br /><br />As a note, don't over microwave these because the plastic will melt and the cookie will burn.",Surprisingly Good,4

"So I must admit that when I ordered this coffee, I thought it was one of the new fancy instants like Starbucks now has.  When I got it and found that it was pods, for which I do not have a maker, I almost sent it back.  But what I wanted it for was those afternoon coffee emergencies at work, where single serves would be perfect. Soooo - I used one of the pods like a tea bag, steeped it in very hot water...and ended up with a great cup of coffee!<br /><br />The flavor is very rich and fruity - not over burnt or weak like I would have expected given my McGyver-type preparation.  I enjoyed the coffee a great deal and will keep this at my desk for more than just emergencies.",Surprisingly Good,4
"I'm really fussy about cocktail mixes. I've tried about 10 margarita mixes, for example, and none tastes as good as a margarita you get in a restaurant. Mojitos are my favorite drink, so I decided to try the Crystal Light, but with very low expectations.<br /><br />Well, the Crystal Light Moctail isn't a very good mojito, but it is a pleasant beverage. There is a little bit of artificial sweetener taste, but it doesn't bother me. The Moctail is an enjoyable and light lime-flavored drink, even though it's not really mojito-y, and I plan to buy more.",Pleasant!,4

"I get my K-cups either at Amazon (used to be the cheapest) or Costco (is the cheapest). The obvious problem with Costco is the selection, maybe 2 or 3 kinds to choose from. That is why I still buy from amazon occasionally, real nice selection to choose from.  I have had my Keurig for about a year and have tried many different kinds of coffee from most of the companies out there. I found the coffee shop brand at Costco and this has become one of my favorites and was my daily cup. If you have ever shopped at Costco you know that things come and go a lot. That was the case with my donut shop yesterday. IT WAS GONE!! Replaced with donut ""house"". I figured for .42 a cup I would give it a try. I am not disappointed at all. It is just as good as the donut shop I used to drink. Perhaps ever so slightly less strong, but an excellent cup of coffee, and cant beat the price at Costco. The only thing that is a little confusing on Amazon is the price?? That is really high. Anyway. If you are a donut shop drinker you will love the donut house every bit as much. Don't hesitate to buy it...but make sure you check the price. Great price available form Costco....this week",Good stuff,4

"I've read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of K-cups... coffee preferences are so subjective.  I did like the flavor of this coffee -- bold but not bitter.  As to ""strength"" I wish that there was more coffee in each K-cup... I am accustomed to Starbuck's strength, and I have to set my Keurig to medium-cup size to get the strength I need.  This is not as cost-effective as -- say Jet Fuel (but I found Jet Fuel too bitter.)<br />If Wolfgang Puck would add more coffee to its K-cups, this would be a perfect coffee for me.",Well-rounded but weak,4

"The switch black cherry is a very good product. I love a drink that has no artificial and/or high fructose corn syrup. It is a great refreshing carbonated beverage. Amazon is about the only place I can find this stuff. Luckily, with Prime it doesnt cost anything for shipping. However, the downside is the cans are rather small and the cost is rather high. I would make this one of my primary drinks if it was less expensive. Also, while this isn't ""good"" for you with the amount of sugar it has, at least it is natural fruit sugar and is not as bad for you. But keep in mind this isn't something you want to drink a 25 pack a week as it is still high in calories due to the high natural sugar content.<br /><br />Flavor wise I have tried the fruit punch and the black cherry so far. I would have to say black cherry is my favorite.","Very good soda alternative, just expensive.",4

"I bought these chai latte cups because I love Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts versions, but BE WARNED just adding water seems to intensify the artifical taste. While this seems redundant ADD MILK! It say latte, but there is something off with the ingredients so I do half water and the other half vanilla soy milk! It tastes great!! I can't digest lactose so I haven't tried cow milk, but Soy Milk does wonders! Don't throw your kcups away just yet. Also, you don't even need a keurig for these cups, alll the powder dissolves in hot water so no straining of grinds is necessary, so I mastered the half hot water half soy milk combo by just opening the foil pouring it all in then filling the cup (probably about 12-16 oz cup) half with hot water then half with soy milk.",Don't Just Add Water!!

Fenugreek worked for me. After my milk supply started to diminish after going back to work I tried Fenugreek. I had to take quite a bit of it though for my milk to sustain my boy's hardy appetite.

When I went outside I actually attracted bees! It became quite the joke between my friends and myself. It was worth it though to be able to continue feeding him on my own.<br />My poor second son was allergic to my milk so I wasn't able to see if it worked.

"This product has better grade materials used to create it than other ""general feed"" brands such as Fri$kies, Me0w M!x, Pur1na, etc because they are essentially just a bunch of fillers, this has at least some chicken meal as the main ingredient setting it far above them in quality. At a price of 30 for 40LB its less than a dollar pound, and the cheapest food prices i have seen are around 60 - 75 cents per lb so its a great price considering its quality.

I ordered them, and before I received them I was supplementing one feeding a day with formula. After I started taking them, I noticed that I was able to pump more and my son seemed less hungry. (The one catch to this is that I was also drinking more fluids and pumping frequently also to help increase my supply, so I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the fenugreek, but there was a definite correlation there.) They taste kind of funny, sort of like maple syrup, and gel capsules are a little weird, but well worth it for the health and financial benefits of exclusive breastfeeding.",helpful for breastfeeding,4

I have a new microwave, but perhaps its wattage is not high enough. I heated some lard in my fryer and tossed the under-cooked ones into the hot fat.  They puffed some more, and some of them were edible.  Then, I put a few of the uncooked chips in the fryer, and finally I had the pork skins I was hoping for! Hot, puffed, crispy, delicious.

"We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake ""healthier"" for ""healthy.""  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.

These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.

In fact, i'm shocked they got this far with the prices and silly names for sizes, etc. The entire experience going into a Starbucks makes me roll my eyes and leave everytime. But anyway, this instant coffee has great roasted taste and aroma. I'll def buy this in bulk from amazon. The 50 count for $29 breaks down to about 60 cents per cup, which the best way to go.

"This tin came in a variety-pack of four (oolong, green, black, & pu-erh) I haven't opened the green and black teas, but the oolong has the appropriate flavor and each dose can be brewed three or four times. The pu-erh has a dark liquor, a good clear consistency, and a great earthy flavor",Affordable Loose Leaf,4
"I had tried the illy issimo Cappuccino and found it to have a strong coffee flavor but with out much of an aftertaste, giving it what I assumed was it's ""Italian style"" coffee quote on the can.  But here with the illy issimo Caffe - the flavor is very bold and the taste sticks around.  Now for some, this is a definite plus.  I think this coffee is designed for coffee fans of bold flavors, dark roasts, French roasts, and especially espresso.  The sweetness is very light and almost vanishes before you can even realize it's there.  It gives you a nice smooth initial flavor, then the coffee comes over the top, dominating the taste.  To me this compares very nicely to Starbucks Doubleshot, except that this seems to have distinctively different coffee bean flavor that is hard to explain as different from Starbucks - but it is slightly.  As for the sweetness, here in the description as I write this - it says 45 calories.  It actually has 50 on the can.  So not for sure if this is an oversight or a recipe change.  Either way, this is definitely something for espresso fans.  If you are looking for a great pick me up during the sweltering summer, this is a nice alternative to hot coffee.  And price-wise, this may save you a few bucks over the price of Starbucks Doubleshot.","For Fans of Cold Espresso, AKA Brand X Doubleshots",4

The cheddar flavor is THE BEST. Sour cream and onion is not far behind. I hate the parmesan and garlic though - I taste almost a fishy after taste. The rest fall somewhere in between. Glad Amazon has them by the case - way cheaper than getting them in the stores.,"Love some, hate some",4
I consider myself a connoisseur of types when it comes to sugar-free candy.  I have been in search of the perfect sugar-free treat for years and I may have found it!  These licorice flavored candies pack a great flavor punch - remind me of chewing on black licorice jelly beans as a kid.  The texture is a bit too grainy but there is no weird aspartame-type aftertaste to them so I can overlook the grain.  Just be conscious of the warning on the label and limit yourself to 4!,Reminds me of old time licorice - texture is a bit off,4
"My two elderly Lhasa Apso dogs loved these organic and healthy treats.  We compared them to the treats we usually give them, and they made it clear that the Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats were every bit as good as their old-time favorites---and I am sure they were much healthier.  The only problem we had was with the size of the treats and the hardness of them for dogs that are as old as our two pets.  We did have to break them up into little pieces but then they quickly devoured them, seemingly having no trouble chewing up the pieces.  We did a test by placing their old brand of treats on a plate along with the Lamb and Barley treats; they finished the latter first and were looking for more so I surmised they felt the extra chewing was worth it.  I would definitely recommend these for younger dogs with better chewing power than our 16 and 17-year-old family pets. Anyway, a ""thank you"" from Mopsy and D. J.",Great for Younger Dogs,4
"OK, so I can't tell if it's making that much of a difference as far as milk production goes.  I've done pretty well regardless, but have tried both this tea as well as the Traditional Medicine version and haven't noticed a difference between the two.<br /><br />I don't really have a reason to be paranoid, but I tried the teas to halp build up my freezer stopck of milk in case I have any issues with production and need a good supply of back-up.  As a result I've tried the teas and brewers yeast pills.  I didn't see a significant increase, but they have served as a security blanket of sorts for me :-)<br /><br />However, I wanted to put this review up because so many of the others talk about how tasty the Yogi version is. I just wanted to say that I think the Traditional Medicines and Yogi tea versions taste almost exactly the same, so go with whichever you find the best deal on!","Pleasant enough tea, not sure if it helps with lactation...",4

"The package arrived promptly and all contents in excellent condition. The product is very tasty, though it is a slight bit too peppery for my taste. I have tried all their varieties, and I like this one and Texas BBQ best. The mesquite is also good, and much milder. They have the texture just right--you wouldn't know it wasn't meat if it were a blind taste test. It is a little wet as a jerky, which makes it a tad messy. Each packet contains a whopping 10 grams of protein! A lot of nutrition in a small, lightweight packet. Ideal for camping, keeping in the car glovebox,in a briefcase or bag, etc. for those times when you need a boost. But for the pepper, I would have given 5 stars, so I rate this 4 stars. Enjoy!",Spirited Jerky Product,4
"I thought I was ordering K-cups since I found this listing in an Amazon e-mail to me about K-cups. The mistake was unfortunate and Amazon made it right by issuing an immediate refund.

"We are reallyt happy with this kit. I purchased an additional sushi book which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're enjoying getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure the professionals do it more efficiently, but there's definitely some fun in preparing this type of cuisine for friends and yourself. Everything's in the box, including a small sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are tricky to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be more extenzive, but for small money, it seems to be a good deal and a lot of fun.",Sushi kit,4

"I often find with decaf coffee to be somewhat on the weak side: not in this product.  The coffee had a strong grip, but not bitter, and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used (note this coffee works well with a soy creamer).  You do not need to apply any extra heap of coffee to compensate for a 'decaf' option!  With such a strong grip, I would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is!",Strong flavor for a decaf brand!,4
product is very good in this price...only if can be improved is stitching....rest its worth and I have ordered it for more...Too fast delivery is another surprise and delivery person was also good...over all experience is good...thanks flipkart team...,Good choice,4
"Product handles as it should. Keeps Kcups organized and the drawer slides out easily.

"There are some witty little things about Bob Marley's dad on the package, that make you kinda feel like you are ""livin' the dream"" alongside the Marley's just by sippin' on a cuppa joe.  This actually struck an emotional chord with me.  I like the idea of helping others achieve/live/enjoy their dreams.<br /><br />But the flavor of this brew didn't really match up to my locally freshly roasted coffee beans.  In fact, I even preferred some whole bean stuff that Kroger made.<br /><br />I understand that there is a world of difference between the Marley Pods and actual beans that you grind.  I took this into account when I gave the product 4 stars.  I like the Marley Organic, and I'm keen on Organics anyway..  But I don't think I'll be buying it again.  At the current price of .67 per unit I can throw out a half pot of freshly roasted coffee and still save money... I'm not sure that the convenience of using a pod is worth the premium.",I like it,4

"I had received a Keurig coffee maker for the holidays and have been hooked since. I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous, but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat..",Great coffee,4
We have been getting this for awhile now. My husband really enjoys the flavor. This last shipment was very disappointing though as several of the cups didn't have the tops on the cups so the coffee was lost. They are expensive and you not expect to this to happen.,taste and shipping,4
"I'd like to be under a tropical palm tree, sipping real coconut water, but I'm in the frigid north, doing the best I can.  This is an instant powder so I didn't expect this to have the 'weighty' flavor of fresh coconut water; however, I really appreciate the light and refreshing  flavor, especially when i am consuming lots of water during heavier workouts.  I have found the dilution of a Tbsp / 8 oz ( 3 Tbsp in my 24 oz water bottle) to be nice and light when I am active;  however, for keeping in the refrigerator for general drinking, I like more taste, so add more powder.  The amount of powder really makes a difference in the taste.  I have tried a couple of other instant coconut waters, and their first ingredient is sugar -- not at all appealing to me  So I am pleased to find a drink powder that has its first ingredient 'evaporated coconut water'.",Serves its purpose just fine,4
"Rice milk isn't my favorite non-dairy milk, but I still occasionally drink it. It's a lot thinner than soy milk, so sometimes I like to cook with it. Unless you get non-sweetened, I feel like Rice Dream really adds too much sugar. It's hard to drink straight, sometimes I like to mix it with a non-sweetened variety. It might be good for sometime new to the non-dairy milk world.","Yummy, but high in sugar.",4

"The packaging was so beautiful, all color coordinating, high color graphics, very artistically created and arranged. They were all designed with the feel of old world European elegance.  (Perhaps the color palette and design motifs from the era of what we associate with Marie Antoinette.)  All the cookies in the assortment were fantastically delicious.  We gobbled through them all in two days.  (most were petite size in packages with 2 servings each approx.) These were more what I would call European biscuit type cookies that you might find enjoyable with afternoon tea (ie. more like shortbread cookies, nibbly, not chewy, and not overly sweet - how refreshing!).  These cookies were all very fresh, made with very high quality ingredients, and a true pleasure to enjoy.  I would highly recommend this gift basket to anyone.  The entire thing was delivered well wrapped and not one cookie was broken on the inside.  The basket was made of very high quality and can be reused as a fruit basket or a bread basket etc.  I can't say enough good things about this gift basket of cookies.","Really really delicious, gorgeous packaging, awesome gift idea",4

"Brand/Products - Came across it while searching through net for a good organic option to baby food. In my little research, learned the brand had some recognition in its field - like Cookie magazine, some interviews on CNN and other news channel and also has a fan page on Facebook!!<br /><br />Packaging/Shipping - I was skeptical as it's frozen, but came well frozen in a Styrofoam container with dry ice. Yes, wish there was another way of packaging it, but I suppose it has to come frozen so at this point Styrofoam may be the only option... but then I am no logistic/shipping expert so don't know what other options are out there for frozen product shipping that are a bit more environmental friendly and/or recyclable.<br /><br />I signed up for a 4-month plan they offer for the Mommy Club members listed on their website. The owners are great about taking suggestions and trying to improve product line and shipping methods - I was called about recycling the Styrofoam container... that they will send a return label with my next shipment so I should return it to them and they can keep using the same container for each of my monthly order or until the container lasts so that's little better than having a new container each month.<br /><br />Products - I have tried all variety from Creamy Yummy and now starting to try to Mushy Yummy! My baby loves pretty much all creamy variety. I even did my own mixing at home - like mix creamy carrots with creamy peas, creamy butternut squash with broccoli or green beans and all such combination as my baby didn't really warm up to peas by itself! :) I add the Happy Baby rice, multi-grain, or Oatmeal cereals to the veggies and to fruits to make it little more flavorful for my baby. In morning, I give the entire fruit portion mixed with 3 tbl spoons of cereal (used to also add formula or breast milk when first introduced Yummy solids, but now mix only the fruit and cereal) and rest of day I give a veggie combo with like 1 tbl spoon of cereal. Unless my baby is tired or sick, she eats the whole portion.<br /><br />Cost - Yes, it's expansive at $2 for each 4 Oz container compared to Earth's Best or Full Circle or even Gerber Organic baby food, which by the way, are jar baby food and not frozen like Yummy's. It's your pick what you do want to give your baby and I know we all want the best for our babies so one choice over another may not be bad - just what you are comfortable with and what works with your own lifestyle and budget!<br /><br />Savings/Discount Option - I called the owners asking about discount since I ordered a lot in one order and was told that they offer something called Mommy Club. So if I join the Mommy Club, which means sign up for a 4 month commitment to order at least 84 containers (7 cases) each month in any verity of baby food from Creamy or Mushy line then I'd get each 4 Oz container at a discounted rate of $1.60 per container or something like that plus any shipping cost. So I thought that was much better than $2 per container and I was going to order from them anyway for next 2-3 months so thought signing up with the Mommy Club was a good option for me!! Yes, shipping is still very costly and that's the only reason I gave this a 4 start rating rather than 5 - wish shipping could be a little less costly at this price of product!<br /><br />So those wanting to order longterm, don't forget to call or sign up with the Mommy Club to take advantage of the savings in cost per product.<br /><br />They are also flexible on monthly order volume if you just cannot get to 84 containers each month or take a little more than a month to make the next order... so just call and ask for the details.<br /><br />In my first monthly order, I got a free Yummy Baby bib, too... that was cool.<br /><br />I made a suggestion on adding certain grains and cereals to Yummy product line to the owners and they said they are looking into it and probably will have it available around June 2010 timeframe so I am looking forward to that. Until then I keep using Happy Baby cereals and admit that my baby loves it and so do I. I hope Yummy also adds probiotic and other nutrition to their cereals like Happy Baby does!<br /><br />Overall, I can't be happier with the product given that I am a working mother and do not have the time to consistently make my own at home, at least not the variety of fruits and veggies that Yummy offers!",Next best option to homemade baby food... if you don't have time to make your own at home!,4

A very well built mole trap that works great when set correctly.  The safety latch is a nice feature that prevents accidental tripping while setting the trap. I don't follow the box instructions but rather set the traps on the surface.  This works well with a lot less effort than trying to bury them.  I've found that a person needs to be very patient.  The mole may not use the tunnel for several days.  In fact I've caught some after five or six days.  Picking the best tunnel is the hardest part of trapping moles so spent your time there rather than moving traps around every two days.,Great Mole Trap,4
"I cannot tolerate HFCS, artificial sweeteners or cane sugar. Maple sugar is therefore my only option for sweetening the herbal tea I drink constantly. This pure maple sugar is extremely refined and powdery. Don't get a spoonful in front of the fan or you will be breathing it in. The taste is very pleasant, and I absolutely love the smell. I understand that this type of sugar is expensive to refine, but I still wish it was a bit cheaper. However, for my particular needs, this is good stuff and I'll be buying it again.",Pleasant taste but expensive,4
"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these crackers - I am always a bit wary of trying GF products since so many have a strange taste and/or texture. These, however, are delicious. They do remind me of Ritz crackers (at least what I remember from eating them 2 years ago) except not quite as oily.<br /><br />Good:<br />- They taste good and have a really nice texture.<br />- I don't think they are exceptionally bland - they have a slight buttery flavor and seem like generic crackers to me. Definitely more flavor that water crackers<br />- I don't taste the funny aftertaste that one of the reviewers mentions. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to that taste than I am.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Cost<br />- Broken crackers: I agree with other reviewers that the packages often contain a lot of broken ones. This is not just when they are purchased online; it is also true of boxes that I've purchased at a store like Whole Foods. I guess these crackers are just fragile and need special packaging.<br /><br />That combination of downsides makes it a tough choice for me about whether to buy these crackers. Do I really want to pay a lot (3-4x as much as ""glutinized"" crackers) for a box of broken crackers? I haven't decided. For now, they are a splurge that I indulge in occasionally.",Yummy but are they worth the cost?,4

"Generally, when I've taken energy shots, it's been during the last half of a long day of driving, at a time when another 16oz energy drink would create overwhelming restlessness and jitters. These little shots--whatever the brand--seem to foster a calmer sense of awake alertness.<br /><br />Today, I took one of these instead of having my morning coffee. The taste was about what you'd expect from one of these, chock full of sugar substitutes that I've never found pleasant.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it gave me energy, but it did keep me awake during a stretch when skipping coffee would have made me sleepy and logey. And, sure enough, when five hours was up--almost to the minute--I conked out.<br /><br />So it works pretty much like the others I've had, but at the present cost here on Amazon, it's about a third of the usual price.","More of the same, at a better price.",4

"Make no mistake... this is a pre-packaged, instant convenience food.  That said, it's quite good for what it is.  Also easy to make: add water, microwave one minute on high, stir, microwave 4 minutes on low.  I prefer that method to the microwave 2 minutes, let stand 10 minutes directions of many other Dr McDougall's soups.  Unfortunately, my microwave doesn't have a high or low setting so it was just a little dry by the end of the last 4 minutes.  I'd probably do 2 or 3 minutes for the second microwaving and see how that goes next time.<br /><br />I also think the packaging is a little misleading.  It looks similar to the packaging of products like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E123IM"">Annie Chun's Udon Soup Noodle Bowl</a> in which you have more of a bowl or meal tray that contains noodles and flavor or sauce packets.  It is in fact a soup cup to which you add water and flavor powder.  I assumed the higher price (vs regular Dr McDougall's soup cups) and the description of 'Entree' meant it would be more like the former, with actual noodles and sauce.  The noodles are much more like ramen noodles.<br /><br />That aside, the flavor is good and I'll continue to eat them now and then, when I'm too tired or busy to cook something, but will probably not reorder.",Delicious for a packaged convenience food,4

"This flavor reminds me of kool-aid or vitamin water.  The flavor is sweet, but light in the sense that it's not overly syrup-y.  I don't mind the artificial sweetener or flavors, so that's not an issue for me, and I didn't notice any bad aftertaste.  When you just don't feel like plain water, using this is cheaper than buying separate bottles of flavored water.","Like kool-aid, but easier",4
"This has a good taste. I had never had these before, so I didn't really have anything to compare it to. It has a good taste, but not the spicy taste you normally find with many Indian foods. The thing I like about most Tandoor products is that the ingredients taste fresh - I know what I am supposed to be eating and I don't have the look at the package to remind me of what is ""supposed"" to be in the package.<br />This isn't a product I would want alone for a meal - but having it with a variety of Indian dishes makes for a very fun meal.<br />These dosa's are individually wrapped - which means I can just eat one at a time and take them out when I am in the mood for one. There are times I will just take out one and heat it for lunch.<br />Overall a really good product if you enjoy a variety of Indian foods.",Good taste,4

"Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously, these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!",The Best I've Found So Far,4
"The pomegranate flavor in this tea makes it a winner. It has that little bit of extra ""something"" that you just need sometimes when you drink a lot of tea. Something different. A different flavor. If you like to eat pomegranates, you'll like this. If you're not a fan of the fruit, you probably won't be a fan of this tea. It has that little bit of zing that the fruit has, and it's just perfect to drink while watching the sunrise.",Tastes great!,4

It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.

"I have been using pill pockets now for about 2.5 years now EVERY DAY for my cat, Baby, for her heart medication. While she's come accustomed to the treat, and won't eat it on its own any more, she will most of the time eat it with other treats she likes.<br /><br />I have noticed, however, a few things: 1) If you don't close the package tightly and keep air out of it, the treats will dry out, and will become MOST undesirable to the kitty. My solution: put the treat bag in another zip lock sealed bag, squeeze out the air, and voila, treats stay fresher longer. 2) The treats for cats are actually VERY large (even for my obese and often hungry kitty!). My solution is to basically cut the pill pockets in half, and smoosh pill inside the pill pocket that way.<br /><br />I have been using the chicken flavor for the last couple years, and have yet to try the salmon flavor, but I'm really hoping the change will be quite palatable for my Baby! Thanks, Greenies, for making a great product that makes pilling my cat so much easier!","Good, but dries out quickly",4

"I tried this coffee with a bit of trepidation. I'm not a fan of hazelnut. I've always found the flavor to be a bit overwhelming which is odd because I really like hazelnuts. Not so here. This was a very tasty hazelnut. The smell was subtle and not at all over-powering. The flavor was nice, nutty without getting into oily & nasty. The coffee in the package is a nice dark color. It's very finely ground so should work well in capacino machines. It brewed up very nicely in our french press and our drip coffee machine. I really enjoyed the experience.<br /><br />The bag on the other hand, I struggled for quite a while to get it open and finally just had to cut the top off. Which made it more than bit difficult to use for later storage. I understand that to retain the freshness, sealing the bag is very important, but in order for me to consume the product, opening the bag is equally important. And since I may be under the assumption that I can continue to store the coffe in the bag, like other brands, making it so I have to partially destroy the bag in order to open it seems slightly counter-intuitive.<br /><br />Anyway, great coffee, not so great packaging. If you get it, make plans for alternate storage.","Nice Coffee, Not so nice package",4

"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents has gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given the small or mini versions of these treats, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers I give them the medium sized ones now- after some trial and error. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. This flavor smells pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh flavored ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay as a treat and the chewing action is always good, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other ones, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are relatively pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.","Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor",4
"Remembering from many years ago when I tried the regular instant tea and was not entirely satisfied with the taste, but now being a raspberry ice tea freak, I thought I'd give this a try. It really doesn't resemble the raspberry ice tea that I often order in restaurants, it reminds more of jello in aroma and taste. But, this won't go to waste. I made a gallon jug of regular tea (I just LOVE those Lipton gallon size single bags) and added this already sweetened raspberry mix to replace approximately 2/3's of my usual sweetener (2 to 1 ratio). I always use some of the boiling water for steeping to pour in the jug with my sweetener so that it's dissolved before I mix in the brewed tea. This combination makes for a nice subtle raspberry flavored ice tea without using up your favorite raspberry tea bags. Too bad I haven't found larger raspberry tea bags for mass quantities like I like.<br />On it's own, I really liked that this mix was easy and quick to dissolve in cold water, just don't expect it to taste like tea. I also like that you can adjust the sweetness. Hint: try less before more.<br />I'm so glad I found this here on Amazon, it's never stocked in my area.",Liquid Jello?,4
"Switch is the ""all natural"" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C.  The flavor in question is kiwi berry.  I must admit this is the third beverage by Switch that I have tried and I believe it tastes the best.  The other flavors I have tried didn't taste bad, but really didn't taste like the flavors they were promoting.  This soda tastes both like kiwi and berry.  A very crisp and light flavored drink and it is only 135 calories a can.  This isn't a bad alternative to a basic can of soda, but the calories in a can of Switch aren't too far from a can of Coke/Pepsi.",It actually tastes like kiwi-berry,4

I have a 10 y/o chihuahua and she really likes this. It is little tiny cubes of dog food mixed with rice. She has lost most of her teeth yet she is able to eat this easily. The cubes are easier to eat then the typical wet dog food that is in a can and then you have to mash up--she can grab onto the cubes easily.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that the pouches are designed in a way that makes some of the dog food stick to the bottom of the pouch. The bottom is concave so it is like a little pocket that traps food.<br /><br />But I would recommend this for anyone with a small dog who is getting up in years. Especially if you have a dog w/ dental problems or who has lost teeth. My dog weighs about 10 lbs and one of these pouches a day along with a dog treat is plenty enough for her.,Better pouch design needed,4

This is the best cup of pod coffee I have tasted so far.<br /><br />In addition to the pod brewer, I also tried this coffee pod in a pour-through basket with boiling water and also steeping it like a cup of tea and found that the flavor was pretty consistent, if not better when brewed outside of the pod brewer (I was able to steep the coffee much stronger and to higher yield in a cup with boiling water -but slower than the pod brewer).  The pods are marked with which side up/down and should be tucked down tight in the pod brewer for the best results.

My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it.

"Coconut oil is a saturated fat. At first glance that alone might make dieters and the health conscious recoil in fear.  Haven't we been told that all saturated fats are artery clogging sludge?  As it turns out, coconut oil is emerging as a near miracle food. Pacific Island populations who get 30-60 percent of their total caloric intake from fully saturated coconut oil have all shown nearly non-existent rates of cardiovascular disease.  The multitude of benefits, including strengthening the immune system and regulating metabolism, make fascinating reading readily available in technical journals and web resources.  Unlike many foods considered healthy, coconut flesh is incredibly delicious.  Since most of us, though, don't relish the idea of hacking the nut to pieces with machetes in the kitchen, coconut is being made conveniently available as in this product, Coconut Manna; a combination of ground coconut flesh and associated oil.  I've been incorporating coconut oil into health shakes so was anxious to try this product which incorporated the flesh as well.  Anyone who has used coconut oil knows that it likes to congeal and form a solid at normal room temperatures and inevitably so in cool locations.  Opening this coconut manna container revealed what resembled a wad of lumpfish stuck to the walls packed in oil.  Not very appetizing.  A metal spoon employed to break it up encountered stubborn resistance.  Submerging the plastic container in warm water would have returned it to an easily workable state, but not something you typically want to do if making a quick health shake or spread.  For that it lost one or maybe one and a half points.  But that's just the natural state of the food and Nutra can't be faulted for that.  The product itself once more malleable is absolutely delicious.  It's tempting to just eat it off the spoon before it makes it to whatever vehicle you planned to park it on.  For smoothy/shake makers, the pure oil form is probably easier to use, though it can congeal also, though probably not as readily or as stubbornly as this manna. It is delicious, but only if you want to take the time to render it at a temperature to make it more easily spread and applied.",Macaroon on a spoon,4

The cheapest I've seen it on Amazon it close to $4.00 a piece and that's without shipping!

"I tested this coffee using a regular Mr. Coffee brewer and a standard coffee filter.  Although the product is designed for those one-cup brewers, I don't have one so I used what I had.  It comes in the sealed pods that are designed to drop right in the the brewer without and mess.  I had to open the pouch to brew it in the Mr. Coffee but still found it made a lot less mess just pouring it from an opening in the pouch.  The first time I just made one cup; the second time I brewed two cups using two pouches.<br /><br />I found the coffee quite good, especially the aroma.  (I really loved the aroma!)  It definitely has floral and berry notes that do not overwhelm the coffee flavor. I like that it is organic and Fair Trade Certified.  This product also claims that ""We use beans only from coffee farms that adhere to strict sustainability ethics.""  You really can't get a much purer source than this.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee gourmand so I shared this brew with a friend who is very particular about her coffee to see her reaction.  I will drink just about any coffee but she likes her coffee strong.  She found this coffee strong and thought that it came awfully close to the coffee she gets from that Seattle chain.

I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.,HONEST REVIEW!,4
"Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity ""candy corn""'aspect one often finds in bourbons. It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18. It's lovely. Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco. There's some leather and cream too. First sip opens bright with honeyed corn. Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect. Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke. It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best. The absence of ""corn likker"" fruitiness is most appreciated. This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.","Lithe and balanced, Woodford is a polished sophisticated bourbon.",4
"this is the original chai tea stuff, and is good almost straight over ice, or with a little milk - iced or hot.

"These bars with 10 grams of protein taste pretty darn good. I especially like the chocolate frosting. And I like nuts. They are just the right sweetness for me, which is to say only moderately sweet. They are gluten-free.<br /><br />What I don't like is that a lot of small shards of I don't know what (maybe coconut?) fly around in my mouth and stay there after swallowing. For some reason I have noticed that I had to be careful not to aspirate (breathe) these light-weight tiny pieces; twice I began to choke while eating one of these bars. The little pieces kept staying in my mouth, all around and between teeth so that I had to carefully and repeatedly rinse. I am disappointed and do not plan to buy these again because this problem means I can't safely eat them.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients from my package:<br /><br />Roasted Peanuts, Almonds, Soy Protein Isolate, Chicory Root Extract, Sugar, Vegetable Oils (palm kernel, palm, canola), Roasted Sunflower Seeds (sunflower seeds, sunflower oil), Toasted Coconut, Whey Protein Concentrate, Tapioca Syrup, High Maltose Corn Syrup, Fructose, Cocoa, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Starch, Rice Maltodextrin, Salt, Soy Lecithin, Dextrose, Baking Soda, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />Some people I know are concerned about the food giant Monsanto. This, I am told, is a Monsanto-owned company.","Ingredient list, tasty - but:",4

These beat baked chips hands down! I love the crunch almost as much as I love the calorie content and the single serve bags! Because they are not fried you are saving fat and calories but they are not flat and tasteless like the baked chips either. You know the ones that if you bite off a piece the wrong way you can pierce your tongue with it? Never again! The BBQ is a tad strong IMHO but they are still keepers! The original flavor is awesome.,"We'll never go back to ""baked""!",4

"When they are fresh they can not be beat. When they are a little past their prime they are still very good. They have a strong mint presence and it leaves the mouth feeling somewhat refreshed and with a minty taste. Do not know if they could alternatively help with the occasional bad breath problem that afflicts anyone at one time or the other. They certainly feel strong enough to convey security in that department and if Mentos wanted to corner the market they should make sure it can also combat the annoying and always irritating (to the ones in the other end) episodes of an unkempt mouth, which is not to say that in some cases is unavoidable and soon enough remedied by the conscientious bearer.<br />Mentos Mint Candy, 1.32 Ounce Rolls (Pack of 30) was the best deal in terms of quantity versus value. What at first might appear as over doing it in the numbers ends up being just right. Enough to say that the fresher the shipment the better because that is the time when the flavor is at its peak. This is the one flavor by mentos that delivers a flavor full of fresh mint and it last right until it is gone. Imagine, if only for a minute, if besides helping to kill the germs that cause bad breath they could also be healthy to the teeth by adding Xylitol which has been proven to greatly reduce cavities and preserve teeth in general. I am probably dreaming but I see Mentos Mint like powerhouses in their own right.<br />4.5 Stars for these mints!",4.5,4
"Because I buy Annie's Peanutty bars for my little one, I like the fact that they are organic, have good protein and less sugar than Nature's Path sweet and salty peanut bars (5g vs 10g), which are my favorites. I must agree however with the reviewer below who stated that they could be hard. Recently I have been buying them at a local grocery store and they were soft enough, but the first time I bought them they were pretty hard making it almost impossible for my little one to bite off a piece. I can imagine being frustrated if I bought more than one box. I still recommend them, as my little one loves them and they are the healthier option among the other bars offered.",Good!,4
"Overall the tea blends made by this company are excellent. I can't get enough! The tea is of high quality and the flavor is awesome. The tea is also loose leaf tea inside the tea bag. My only complaint is about the tea bag itself. Sometimes the entire string will become saturated with tea and acts as a siphon and siphons the tea in the mug onto my desk. I'll walk away and come back to find my desk covered in tea. I have to cut the string off with a pair of scissors everytime I make tea. So the tea bag needs some looking into, but the tea is just incredible!",Excellent tea blend,4

I like the size of these cookies because you feel like you are getting more out of your snack than one signle larger cookie.

"Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement.

So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS.

"These are pretty good bars.  I like that they don't have 30 grams of protein, so I can actually finish a whole one without feeling lethargic.

I would honestly rather not have it sweet, but I'm sure most people won't find this an issue.",Good Protein Bar,4
"I'm used to grinding my own beans, but occasionally I run out, and I like to have some 'backup' coffee at hand.  Sealed in convenient single-dose foil pouches, this coffee fits that bill admirably.<br /><br />Marley is a name I associate with Jamaica, home of some of the world's best coffee.  This coffee isn't Jamaican, though; it's an Ethiopian medium roast, ground and put into a little multi-purpose sealed filter.  It's not a 'pod' as that trademarked term is used, but it's about the right size to lay flat on the floor of your small four-cup drip coffee maker.  Or, it can be torn open and the  ground coffee used any way you wish.<br /><br />I generally tend to like a fairly weak brew compared to my coffee-hound friends; this is enough grounds for me to make 12 oz of coffee, not more.  The flavor is not particularly dynamic; there's no French-roast ""burnt"" flavor but little of the floral or buttery aromatics that I like in my light roasts- as stated, it's a 'medium' roast.  In fact, 'inoffensive' is probably the right way to describe it, few coffee drinkers would throw this one out of bed.<br /><br />Summary:  sealed packet for long shelf life; single-dose amount; boring flavor; not going to compete with fresh-ground.  For what it is, it's good.","Serviceable, very convenient coffee",4
"I ordered this product with the understanding that it was not actually rice, it has a very different consistency than rice but I am open to foods that are better for us.<br /><br />Just be aware that it will take some pairing with a well seasoned or spicy entr&eacute;e while deciding if this product will be a constant in your kitchen, my family is becoming used to the new rice and I am confident we will keep it on the menu.<br /><br />This rice alternative may not be for the true rice lover and though I love a good plate of rice, keeping the starch and calorie intake down is worth giving this product a try.",Super LOW Calorie Alternative,4

"Honestly, I haven't searched the Nutiva site for recipes, so I'm not sure what all the possible uses are for Coconut Manna. I will say that all by itself it tastes pretty yummy. I keep finding my 9-yr-ld daughter sneaking spoonfuls of it! So far we've spread it on toast and tried making smoothies with it. The smoothies didn't work too well because it solidified into little chunks that wouldn't blend and then got stuck in the straws. I can imagine it would be good to bake with, though.<br /><br />It's essentially pureed coconut. The consistency is dependent on the room temp, as coconut oil has a rather low melting point. When I first bought this, the weather--and hence our house--was pretty warm, and the consistency was that of oobleck. :D  But as the temp dropped, it became more solid.<br /><br />All in all, it's been good, but not sure I'd buy more only because I don't cook a lot. I thought this would be more something that could replace cream cheese and such for me as I'm allergic to milk, but it's not quite right for that. Still, it does taste good and I'm sure it's loaded with nutrients!","Yummy, but not sure what to do with it",4

"This coffee is a great way to start your day! I read a few other reviews that said it was weak.  Perhaps some of that is machine? We use a Keurig and empty each packet into our re-usable filter.  My husband says it's about as strong as his other ""medium/bold"" roasts, but with a better flavor.  I would agree with that - the flavor is better than most coffees, and I can drink it with my regular 2 creams, which I can't do with ""bold"" coffees.  I only knocked off one star because of the price.  I can get 15 of these for ten bucks, or 50 of the Donut Shop Brand for thirty bucks.  If it were a little more comparable, I'd probably be willing to spend a little more for something both my husband and I really enjoy.  As it is, we will stick with a slightly more economical brand and this might be a ""treat"".  :-)","A bit acidic, but great flavor!",4
"This is a good mild and sweet ceylon cinnamon.<br />Anyways, i'm using it to lower blood sugar, i'm not diabetic but i'm trying to loose weight and by lowering blood sugar it helps regulate the insulin levels. A teaspoon of cinnamon a day lowered my blood sugar levels after eating a meal, i simply sprinkle it on my food or mix it in, it's mild enough that i sometimes don't even notice it's on my toast etc.<br />Higher insulin levels lead to less use of excess blood sugar (and sugar is stored in the body as fat), so a reduction in insulin after a meal is significant. If cinnamon can help control the level of blood sugar and, by offshoot, fat levels, then that is corroboration of what some have said regarding its weight loss potential.",Nice Mild & Sweet Cinnamon,4

"This is a berry flavored beverage that actually tastes like a berry drink. Most of the energy drinks have a chemically after taste and the flavors are weak and don't mask it well. The new taste that the advertisements are talking about is backed up by reality in this case. I shared it (it is a big can) with some of my friends who drink a lot of energy drinks including Monster and No Fear and they were also surprised by the flavor. Good news: the can shows only 1 carb per serving and lists no sugars. Not sure about that, but it's better than some competitors that have the equivalent of a dozen donuts worth of sugar!<br /><br />A huge down side is that a can of this has about 260 calories, which makes it one of the higher calorie energy drinks out there.<br /><br />Also, the caffeine in this drink is appx 87 mg per serving (2x each can) which is lower than some of the other energy drinks. So if you are going for caffeine for energy this one wont work. Admittedly, they are going for supplement energy from Creatine, Guarana, L-Carnitine and Taurine and you really ought to know what works for you before you start buying cases of this stuff.<br /><br />Overall, a much better flavor which will likely become a favorite for energy drinkers.","Much, Much Better Taste",4
"These are normal Honey Maid graham crackers.  Who doesn't love them?  I found them as tasty as ever.<br /><br />The main difference in this product is a packaging difference.  While normal graham crackers come in two long packs with many crackers, this one comes with the crackers already broken down to squares.  Each small square pack of eight crackers comes in its own wrapper.<br /><br />This is a great, simple idea.  If you're a busy, on-the-go person, I think you'll find this product very convenient.  It would be great for packing a lunch for school or work in a hurry.  It would also be great for moms to throw in a purse or diaper bag to have a fast, easy snack for toddlers.  Also, in our family we find that we might only want to eat a couple of crackers, but once you open a pack you feel like you either have to eat them all or let them go to waste.  This product solves that problem.<br /><br />I would say that it depends on the price of the product if it really makes sense to buy these.  Ziplock bags are pretty cheap, and it doesn't take too terribly long to throw a few crackers in there.  Also if you have a large family that would consume an entire pack of graham crackers before these go stale, then this product adds no benefit, is harder to get into, and is worse for the environment.  All in all, though, I think this product has a place in the market.  If you're like me and find yourself trying to grab something quickly while you're always running late, this is a great choice.","Simple difference, great idea",4

"I really like Vitamin Waters.  They make me feel healthy, and keep me from chugging down another soda.  So multiple wins there.  Often they taste quite sugary, but there are quite a few good flavors.  This is one of them, the Grape-Raspberry.<br /><br />The Mega-C, grape-raspberry vitamin water does taste a lot like grape.  In fact, it kind of reminded me of those squeeze grape drinks you drank as a kid, or maybe cool-aid.  I definitely liked it as it added a bit of nostalgia to my day.  Or at least made me think of warm summer days with popsicles and fun at the pool.  The sugar was maybe a little too sugary, but again, that kind of fits with the kids drink profile.  I didn't really taste the raspberry, my guess is that it is overpowered by the grape taste.<br /><br />Vitamin Water is known for it's ingredients.  It isn't organic by any means, but it does have a lot of good ingredients.  The sweeteners are fructose and rebiana.  Which are ok as far as sweeteners go.  There are also natural flavors and some vitamins added in.  Surprisingly, even with some of these ingredients, there are zero calories in this drink.  And no fat or sugars either counted in the nutrition facts.  But there is Vitamin C, some Vitamins B, Zinc and some other vitamins.<br /><br />This is a good workout drink, or water substitute, or other kind of drink substitute.

"Up until now, I had only ever used koshering salt in my cooking. I really felt kind of silly making what felt like an extravagant salt purchase. I added the item to my shopping cart and then removed it several times. Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I pulled the trigger and bought this salt.<br /><br />It truly does taste wonderful, especially as a 'finishing salt' added right before serving. On really ripe tomatoes, it is AWESOME! I have also learned that this salt is not really an extravagance when it comes to yeast bread baking. Apparently, yeast LOVES trace minerals! This salt has elevated my breads (both literally and figuratively) from pretty good to outstanding! And just like ""that,"" I no longer felt silly buying expensive salt, because, I have spent a LOT of money on natural additives to enhance my yeast bread baking. (This one was cheap in comparison and can be used for other things!)<br /><br />I held back one star because I am very finicky about textures, and in very few applications with this salt, you can experience a very slight grittiness (from the undissolved minerals, I guess).",Really Does Make a Difference,4

"I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause. I will be looking for a recipe for real avena which is probably not that hard to make and a lot healthier.<br /><br />As a sidenote, you can buy this at your local supermarket (in the section of south american foods) in 8 oz containers for half the price.",Good but not quite like the real thing,4

"The whole line of Dreamfields Pastas claims to be much lower in carbohydrates than most and that is a very good thing. Pasta is known for its high content of carbs and being the situation that it is not permissible to indulge so liberally in large amounts of carbs, Dreamfields is what you would call a low carb eater pleasure. I have read many opposing views as to their claims and many more views at to their merits, and personally, I take sides with the majority that celebrates their existence in a rather meager market where options of low carb pasta are almost non existing. Of the few that are around I definitely put Dreamfields at the top. Why? Because it does not taste or cook like something other than real pasta. Goes well with sauces, without sauces just butter and parmesan and even their lasagna allows for that tasty dish to be enjoyed without a large amount of guilt. I can only trust the numbers the company throws at consumers to be based on solid research and information.  The fact of the matter is that being able to enjoy pasta such as this makes a lot of people very happy, and I am first on that list. Did not like the fact that for a while amazon stopped selling it because it told me that either the demand was low or that the company did not want to do business with amazon. For a while there I could not find it under amazon prime, just at outside vendors and the prices had seriously skyrocketed upwards to justify the purchase. Yes, I knew of other places where to obtain this same pasta (not the manufacturer which I find a little tad on the difficulty side) but another credible internet store that specializes in very healthy A-Z alternatives. I found this one, Dreamfields Pasta Healthy Carb Living, Penne Rigate, 13.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), in amazon and I immediately made the purchase because I would be misleading if I did not say that I prefer to deal mostly with amazon for I never have any issues that I later regret and that is saying a lot. 4 Stars.",Dream Fields,4

"It's so hard to describe tastes, how do I write a helpful review? I like to grind my own coffee right before brewing and I use a french press every day and when I'm lazy and also like to make Turkish coffee on special occasions for 1 or 2 friends or just myself.<br /><br />I like dark (but not too dark, not bitter) earthy brews - I usually steer away from ""bright acidity"" and ""fruity"" beans (though when I tastes those I can still tell if it's good coffee or not). I drink my coffee with sugar, but no milk (except sometimes when I'm in the mood). I also don't like overly dark, skunky or burnt coffee. I really don't care about how much caffeine is in the beans, but if you must know the darker roasts have less caffeine remaining, even though they may taste ""stronger"" :0)<br /><br />Just for reference: I like Peet's ""Major Dickason blend"" and Starbucks ""Verona"" blend and Espresso roast, they're not the ""best"", but indicative of what I'm going for. But I really don't like what Starbucks puts in their cups, which everyone carries like they're wearing a uniform.<br /><br />Anyway, I bought a 5 lb. bag of these Brazilian Santos and also a dark version. I like the dark a little better, but they both taste like versions of itself and are very good, well rounded, solid beans. I ordered these because I can't really find Brazilian beans anywhere locally and also because I like their low acidity.<br /><br />But these beans on their own don't really produce the most complex (or ""interesting"") cup - I use these to mix with certain more assertive coffees I got from Costco, to stretch them out and breathe a little more interest. I think they're ideal for that, because they're good enough where they don't take away flavor, but neutral enough not to take over the flavor.<br /><br />I don't regret buying these and Coffee Bean Direct is a great deal, but I will try another kind next time - I usually only come back to exceptional brews and I only just discovered CBD, so there's more to try.<br /><br />Perhaps, if I owned a coffee shop or a pastry shop or cafe, I would use these (and their darker version) because it seems like the coffee that would please everyone. These are like home-made chicken soup - impossible to hate (and SO much better than store bought), but also not really a 3-star entree :)<br /><br />I hope this helps, if you have questions I'll try to respond :)","Pleasant earthy beans, low acidity, but it lacks a certain interest on its own - blend it with brighter beans!",4
"I decided to get the Whole Foods Market Mighty Bowls of Goodness Gift Box for my 20 yr old daughter who is a vegan. She always has difficulty finding foods that fit her lifestyle, and holiday gatherings are especially trying times for her. I think she'll appreciate having a variety of delicious all organic, gluten-free, and vegan friendly grains and seasonings at her fingertips. Hopefully she will whip up a couple of the included recipes as part of Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow! I'm looking forward to sampling some of whatever she makes.<br /><br />My gift box arrived double boxed in perfect condition. The box and contents are exactly as shown in the product photos on the Amazon webpage. The gift box is sealed with kraft tape. I imagine this is both to keep it closed safely during transit, and to act as a tamper evident seal. I opened it up to make sure everything had arrived safely - which it had. The interior of the box has a nice double flap, and generous amounts of crinkle-shredded kraft paper, to protect the contents. Most everything is easily recyclable except the 3 plastic bags containing the grains. The expiration dates on the products are clearly marked and all are well into late 2012 or 2013 - so everything is nice and fresh.<br /><br />Overall a very nice gift for the healthy eater on your gift list!",Healthy and Thoughtful Gift,4
"My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.","Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others",4

"I like popcorn, but I love chocolate and caramel even more. Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn combines all three of these ingredients into one, with a sweetness level that makes this product more like candy than popcorn.<br /><br />When consumers think of caramel corn, the first product that comes to mind is Cracker Jack and this Snackwell product does, indeed, remind me of this classic snack food product. The difference is that Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn goes a step further by adding fudge to the mix. There isn't a ton of fudge- it is only lightly drizzled- but it certainly present and it adds more flavor to an already tasty product.<br /><br />This Snackwell food tastes great, but if I had to register one complaint, it would be the same complaint that many other reviewers have already made: there is an awfully high amount of sugar in each serving. The individual serving packs are nice because they allow easy convenience and only a small amount of the snack, helping consumers avoid over-consumption. But even with such a small serving size of only one ounce, there are still eighteen grams of sugar per pack. If you can eat only one pack, you should be okay, but I will be the first to admit that it is very easy to eat two or three packs at a time. Multiply this by eighteen grams of sugar per serving and you are bound to experience a case of sugar overload.<br /><br />Snackwell makes this product with only a minimal amount of fudge. I would have liked it better with even more fudge, but at the same time, I realize that any additional fudge would likely spike the sugar content even higher. So, as much as the chocolate flavor would be enjoyable, I am happy that Snackwell kept its ambitions under control.<br /><br />Snack foods are a regular part of life for me and I am happy to have tried this Snackwell product. I like the flavor profile very much and while I agree with others who voice concerns over the sugar content, this product isn't much worse than other sweet snacks.

It's smooth, not bitter, and doesn't require me to add a ton of half & half to get it to my liking.

"A quality product with a fun, interesting flavor. I'm fond of both blackberries and vanilla, and found that both flavors stood out in this tea.

They have a hint of sweetness without being too sweet, and the citrus gives them a nice bit of tartness. The dried cranberries add a good, chewy texture to the crispy cookie.

The flavor is a little off from some other pastas I have tried (but we are not whole grain pasta lovers at all, so take that into account). A good way to have a little fun and change to the lunch menu. And to note...they are very small, like letters in soup.

"As a near-daily coffee drinker, I've had ample opportunity to try just about every sweetener on the market. Thanks to Amazon Vine, my ""go-to"" sweetener"" has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OQ257M"">Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamins, Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)</a>, and although I don't particularly have a natural or organic bent, I'm okay with using all natural products that are effective and don't cost more than the competitors. It seems Nectresse fits in that niche.<br /><br />This is an all natural sweetener derived from monk fruit (whatever that is), it has a texture and flavor pretty close to a ""light"" sugar, much like another all natural sweetener, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8Y892"">Truvia Natural Sweetener, 1000-Count Packages</a>. I found the flavor adequate and the sweetening amount pretty much in line with other artificial and natural non-sugar sweeteners. There aren't any vitamins or extras in this product, which is fine if you just need to sweeten something and nothing more. The individual packs are single serving size and convenient as always. The orange color is eye opening and easy to find in my cluttered tea-bag, coffee filter, other-sweetener-laden morning drink drawer. That is to say, this is a product that does what it should in an all natural fashion at what looks like a reasonable price. It's maybe not outstanding, but I just want my coffee a little sweet, and Nectresse delivers.

"Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great ""seasoning"" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.","Handy for ""Seasoning""",4

"This tastes lovely in terms of spices, but there is absolutely no pumpkin to this. It isn't sweet, either. I currently am mixing this syrup with some sugar free vanilla I picked up today and that is making it better --- but still not what I expected. I would still be willing to try other flavors, though. Someone said it tastes like those red hot cinnamon candies; that seems very accurate, only not as intense.<br /><br />As mentioned in another review, mine didn't have any kind of seal on it other than the twist off cap, but it did sound sealed, so I suppose it is safe.<br /><br />Good thing? It came with a pump!<br /><br />I would say this is likely best used in tandem with either a basic sweetener/vanilla/pumpkin pie syrup because this by itself isn't what you're looking for.<br /><br />---<br /><br />EDIT 22 September 2012 --- upgrade from 2 to 4 stars<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the next business day after I made this review I got a phone call from Paul, owner of Amoretti. We talked about their products, the syrups in particular of course. Apparently people either love or hate this one, not much in between. He made the point that none of the syrups are very sweet or sugary (which is what led me to buy this instead of pumpkin pie, worrying it would be too sweet) and don't even use artificial sweeteners. He asked if he could send me the pumpkin pie flavor and some other goodies, which I felt bad for accepting, but I am glad I did.<br /><br />He sent, overnight, three full size bottles of syrups (pumpkin pie, violet lavender, and crema di vanilla), a mini sampler of their three olive oils, and two samplers of martini mixes.<br /><br />Absolutely astounding customer service. Just ... I am still gobsmacked. If I could rate just the company from 1-5 stars, I'd give them a 20.<br /><br />I have used the pumpkin spice a few more times since I wrote the original review above and still am not a big fan of it, though I think I can definitely find some uses for it. It seems like it would be best not as a base flavoring, if that makes sense, but to use more like a quarter to half a pump at the very most to add just a touch more spice to a drink.<br /><br />ALL the syrups are quite concentrated, so that doesn't necessarily work in favor of a spice flavor, because you think oh, it needs more sweetness, I'll add more. Do NOT do that. It will make it taste terrible. Definitely stick with the reccommendations of how much to use in a hot or cold drink on the back of the bottle. Each pump of syrup has 4g of sugar so adding more syrup isn't going to help. That was, admittedly, a mistake I had made with the pumpkin spice.<br /><br />Also, for either the pumpkin pie or the pumpkin spice, consider getting the crema di vanilla and putting a quarter to half a pump in your drink. It's like putting the whipped cream on your pumpkin pie. Absolutely amazing.<br /><br />I may update this again if I can find a way to truly enjoy the pumpkin spice flavor, but everything else seems amazing and you cannot find better customer service anywhere. They really take your input into consideration and want feedback. This brand is definitely worth the money.<br /><br />Thank you, Paul. Never buying another brand, again.","All spice, no pumpkin",4

"All 5 of my cats liked both flavors preferring the Chinese chicken to the very watery pot pie. Although it does not state it is human grade, it certainly appears that it is by sight and smell. Both appeared to have a cornstarch based ""gravy"" with shredded or diced white chicken meat and diced carrots. I took my cats gobbling it down that it was tasty. I was surprised all of them liked both flavors as 2 of my cats are rather finicky. This cat food reminds me of a similar product Whole Foods used to carry in their brand name that I bought on a clearance sale. I alternate buying dry and canned food by Castor & Pollux's (regular and organic), Natural Balance, AvoDern, and By Nature (regular and organic). I feed them regular canned during the week and organic canned food on the weekends. The only issue I have w/ this product is the price point. The brands previously listed range from 5.5 to 6.5 oz. (By Nature-only 12 6.5 cans) and none are watery. They cost the same per can or you could view it as almost half price since the weight is almost double. Since I'm feeding 5 cats approximately 3oz. canned per day and all the dry they can eat at about $2/oz., I try to be as cost effective as possible while only purchasing those high quality products which I also consider this cat food to be. If you read up on pet food in general, you will no longer purchase poor quality food such as Friskies, Iiams, Science Diet, Fancy Feast, etc. If you go to PETCO or Care A-Lot(they carry better brands than PetSmart) and read the ingredient list you will be shocked, appalled, and enlightened. Cats do not well tolerate wheat, corn or soy and NO pet should EVER be fed animal by-products (see pet food at About.com for more information). Since Amazon currently has a [...] coupon off of [...] purchase, I will likely go ahead and purchase the crab flavor and the mixed fish case. Keep in mind you should limit the amount of tuna fed to your cat as well as to your children and any adult (see FDA website for tuna cautions and listed safe fish to eat).

"This is my first order of sesame oil, after reading & hearing of Ayurvedic medicine practiced in India for thousands of years.<br /><br />I purchased this to use on my skin and also cook some vegetables in and otherwise ingest as well, as the benefits reported are numerous on both counts.<br /><br />What I've learned thus far in relation to the benefits for the skin are as follows, summarized briefly: Sesame oil has antifungal and antibacterial properties, as well as what you may expect as to moisturizing the skin, as it is a naturally occurring oil in the environment. I really wanted organic, cold-pressed oil, and this product didn't say either, but I bought it anyway, to try out since it is my first try. I've read it's great for athlete's foot and even toenail infections, acne and other skin conditions including dandruff & psoriasis.

I'm excited to see what benefits I'll experience while using this (to me) new method of healing with food.<br /><br />Now, having explained why I purchased it in the first place, let me say that this particular product is of the darker variety, and has a very strong burned nut odor to it. Nevertheless, I did apply it to my hands, arms, legs and feet yesterday evening and allowed it plenty of time to soak in. It wasn't greasy anymore for me just before bed, so I left it on & slept with it overnight. As I expected with any oil I may have used, I woke up with soft, smooth skin that felt nourished, not dry & itchy in winter months as usual, and I'm in Florida, so I imagine those in colder climates may enjoy those particular benefits even more.<br /><br />I also wanted to use this for my son's acne (14 years of age) but it smells so badly to him that he wouldn't allow that.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase & am beginning this new regimen, though I do wish I had held out for the cold-pressed organic oil instead, which I hear doesn't have such a strong odor. I'm hoping that the benefits will still be realized, however, as I now have quite a bit of oil here to use on a daily basis.<br /><br />It was packaged very well within Amazon's shipping box, and arrived very quickly as most of my items do, but in fairness, I have the Prime membership with 2-day shipping.

"These cookies are gluten and wheat free, but do contain dairy products. They are very good for the kind of snack that they are. I find them a little dry and out of three boxes, (they come as 12 packs of two cookies in a box,) only the first came with the cookies intact. A lot of them were almost all crumble with very little cookie. But if you need to stay gluten free, then you would probably enjoy them anyhow.",How the cookie crumbles.,4

"My dog Cora - a 50 lb. Boxer/Pit-bull mix - loves any and all treat toys.  I recently broke down and bought one of these toys and she loves it as well!  I've limited her to one treat every two weeks, since they are not cheap and I don't know the caloric density of these treats and like to keep her weight well regulated.  In the between times, I place treats/kibble inside the ball and she flings it around the apartment to get them out.  I've had to take the Everlasting Treat Ball away from her on occasion because she WILL NOT STOP eating the treat and starts to get frustrated that she CAN'T GET IT OUT!  She has popped out the treats occasionally but only after several hours of chewing and licking it beforehand.  It's nice to have something I can give her that will keep her occupied.<br /><br />TIP: Make sure you get the right size!  Otherwise, it will be more likely that your dog can pop the treats out.  I bought Cora a LARGE.<br /><br />TIP: Put the treats in upside-down!  This trick was mentioned by someone else who commented, and it definitely works for my dog.  It is a lot more difficult for her to pop out the treat if the convex side is toward the center of the ball and the flat surface is exposed.  She does get a bit more frustrated with the toy if I do this though, so I have to watch her more carefully to make sure she's not chewing up the toy just the get the treat!<br /><br />TIP: I tried the fire hydrant version of this toy first, but Cora chewed the edges off around the treat in order to get it out faster.  So... it died.  This one is much more durable since it doesn't have the same sort of ""lip"" around the edge.",Finally some alone time!,4
"I like both this version and the original with no preference for which one tastes better.

"It is winter season and when it come to choosing Starbucks coffee most will go for gimgerbread or other holiday flavors.  But this Thanksgiving season, I have tried Vanilla flavored Starbucks ground coffee and it is nice way to start one's day.  It is not too bold of a flavor and sweetness is not overwhelming.  The fact that coffee was already ground speeds up the process of making a morning drink.  The fresh taste stay long after cup is finished.

"Make no mistake, this cereal is not a strongly flavored or sweet cereal.  Look elsewhere if that is what you are looking for.  What it does happen to be is a healthy, lightly sweetened cereal chock full of protein that fills you up.  And that last point is my favorite part.  This cereal actually fills you up for the entire morning.  All I have for breakfast is a small bowl of Kashi GOLEAN and a Greek yogurt and I am rolling out of the door with over 20g of protein (milk included).  I will admit that after eating cereals like Honey Bunches of Oats and all of the other cereals this cereal will seem a little bland but after a couple of bowls (especially with fruit) it will catch on with you and you will start enjoying it.  I am a Marine that needs lots of protein for my workout schedule and I really enjoy the energy gained from this cereal, and the fiber will really fill you up as well.  I even have my 7 yr old turning down Trix to ask to eat my Kashi after he caught the bug!  The great thing is you will feel like a stud after eating this knowing you consumed a small amount of calories to gain a large amount of fiber and protein that will keep you full until lunchtime and avoid any guilt about eating a crappy breakfast.",Great for you with a nice subtle taste!,4
"Got this to try another type.  I have been drinking the rain forest extra bold and that is pretty good.  I can make a decent cup of coffee that fills a mug.

"I chose this food for my dog because it was the only one without a ""filler"" ingredient high in the list.  Although I've been feeding cheaper brands to dogs in the past, I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so.  Overall, it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.<br /><br />My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble, but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little brown kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits).  He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry.  I've read plenty of reviews on pet-oriented sites about dogs who do the same.<br /><br />If your dog is not a picky eater, the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food, you'll probably have no issues with this brand.

"Since I cut back on sugar, I stopped buying sugar-filled hard candies. Brach's Butterscotch was one of my favorites. To me, Brach's is one of the best brands of hard candy and candy corn out there that I use its products as a yard stick. None of the local stores carry the sugar free Brach's Butterscotch. So I took a risk in ordering a box of 12 because I couldn't find any online store that sold it in individual packs without ridiculous shipping fees. \<br /><br />The first time I had one of these, I wasn't sure I liked them. I figured my tastebuds remembered the originals and needed a little time to adjust. Over time, I grew to love these and don't miss the originals.<br /><br />A word of warning: These have sugar alcohol in them, so they can irritate the stomach or cause gas pains. If Brach's tries to make them a different way without the sugar alcohol, it probably won't taste as good. The advantage of this, however, is that it helps you from eating too many knowing this could happen. I never eat more than four pieces a day (three pieces makes a serving for 35 calories!).<br /><br />Each candy is the same size as the originals -- about the size of a quarter on the outside and a thickness of about a stack of 5 quarters.

"Received my pack yesterday and couldn't wait to rip it open since I had just been contemplating what to eat to satisfy my sweet tooth. A number of thins didn't survive the shipping so lots of broken pieces, which were actually easier to eat than the full cookie. The actual thin itself is pretty hard and has a tendency to crack in several directions when you bite into it, which makes for a messy endeavor. I set it on my pant leg and was rewarded with lots of crumbs. But the taste is pleasing, nice blueberry hints and though I didn't get the brown sugar flavor as much as I wanted to, it's still sweet enough to satisfy a craving.

Whether it stacks up against the really high end brands I have no idea since I don't drink those.  Anyway, since it is pretty much just regular water I wouldn't see any point paying any excessive price for it, but it is good.<br /><br />That is all.",H 2 Oh!,4

"I have not purchased Gudrun from Amazon but have locally at another large retailer that brings it in annually for Christmas/holidays.  I used to have my own retail shop and I actually put in refrigerated cases and storage in order to import this line from Belgium.  I was a candy/gourmet buyer for 16 years.  When I bought Gudrun for resale, they were so concerned about quality control that I was told by the vendor in order to make the mocha cream for the Zebra piece, they bought the coffee beans, had their own grinding equipment and developed the chocolate from A to Z in house.  I had one customer come to my store before hurricane Kate, hoping to get a couple Zebras to get her through the storm.  So, not high school chocolate, which is waxy.  However, it is vital that this product be handled appropriately and not outdated.  Any chocolate, if mishandled and old, will not taste as the manufacturer intended.  If it has whitish discoloration on the surface, it has gone through a temperature flux, separating the oils.  Incidentally, the Zebra was my favorite.  Very hard to find now.  It was a mocha cream on a burned sugar/croquant base with white chocolate coating (yellowish-cream colored, very rich) and dark chocolate zig-zagged across the top to make the ""Zebra.""  Apparently now made in a dark chocolate as well.  HTH.",Gourmet chocolate from Belgium,4

"I bought my first order of this a few days ago and have experimented with putting it in smoothies. I make a banana, frozen strawberry, yogurt, and almond butter smoothie that I really like, for which I have used soy protein in the past. I'm starting to worry about eating too much soy, however, so tried this option. It works just as well but the green powder does make my smoothie turn light ""brown."" The nutty taste blends in well with my drink because it already has the almond butter -- so I don't really notice any flavor change from the soy. I also add a splash of vanilla, which helps. My wife thinks the color is gross, but I don't really care what color I am drinking. So I can definitely recommend this product for smoothies. (As an aside, the same folks make Living Harvest Hempmilk, which is nutty in flavor and also good.)",Works well in smoothies.,4

"I originally purchased Natural Calm to help with my own insomnia and anxiety issues. I started out with 1/2 teaspoon and gradually worked up to 1 teaspoon taken before bedtime. If I take more than 1 teaspoon, it has a laxative effect the next day. Even though it does help me relax, it doesn't really help with the insomnia. I've recently switched to Slow-Mag for a more sustained release of magnesium throughout the day. It doesn't have the same laxative effect, plus helps with daytime anxiety. However, my spouse (who has fibromyalgia) has had positive results with Natural Calm. It has improved his quality of sleep and also helped with muscle aches and overall fatigue. He takes about 1 to 1/2 teaspoons each night. I anticipate that he will want to continue purchasing Natural Calm.

I really like this Double Green Matcha tea. I prefer the taste to the other green teas offered by Tea Republic. The price is reasonable and it is better than most readily available green tea out there. I can brew to large cups of tea from one bag without losing much flavor in the second cup.

"Well, let me start by saying that I DO like unfrosted strawberry PopTarts. These Toaster Pastries are almost as good, as PopTarts, and as far as the organic label, better for you if you like to support organic farming, have chemical allergies, etc.  PopTarts DO have real fruit, unlike a previous review implies.  However, Kellogg's uses DRIED fruit, which I think gives a FRUITIER, slightly more tart flavor.  I have a hard time finding the fruity flavor, fruity enough in the Nature's Path.  They need to try drying their fruit, too, to concentrate the flavor. I think that most people who are health/nutrition conscious would also be disappointed to find that Nature's Path frosted AND unfrosted (blueberry is the flavor that I have, since the unfrosted strawberry is 10 bucks more than the frosted ones on Amazon...go figure) has a higher sugar content, and zero whole grain, although the overall fiber is 1 gram per serving instead of ""less than one gram"" on the PopTarts.  I will also state, that as of yet, I have never received anything stale from Amazon.  I do prefer all of my Tarts toasted.","Higher in sugars than Poptarts, NOT whole grain",4

"Because I barely average six hours of sleep each night, I need a lot of coffee to keep me going throughout the day.  I love iced coffee during the warm summer months.  Many of the fast food chains are providing it.  Coca-Cola is now selling coffee in the can.  The illy issimo Cappuccino, manufactured by Coca-Cola, is much sweeter than the illy issimo Caff&egrave; [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].  The Cappuccino has a lot more sugar and milk than the Caff&egrave;, which is basically black coffee.  However, the Cappuccino still pales in comparison to other leading brands.  I have posted photographs of illy issimo Cappuccino alongside its leading competitors: Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy + Coffee Drink, Mocha [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U56LE2"">Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy+Coffee Drink, Mocha, 15 oz (Pack of 12)</a>], and Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBVJI"">Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].<br /><br />  I enjoy the sweet, creamy taste of illy issimo Cappuccino straight from its can or sipping it from a glass full of ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  However, it doesn't taste as delicious as the Starbucks Doubleshot.  (See my posted photograph.)  When compared to Starbucks and Java, the liquid in the glass is still darker than the others.  (See posted photograph.)  I don't think Starbucks has to worry about losing customers to Coca-Cola.  I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy coffee drinks manufactured by Starbucks instead of illy issimo.<br /><br />  Also, I don't quite understand why the cans of illy issimo say, ""Do Not Shake.""  I posted a photograph of a glass bottle of Starbucks Frappuccino Mocha [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS"">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>]; one can see that its contents have settled at the bottom.  I always shake my bottles and cans of coffee drinks before opening them.  The contents have never spewed like carbonated soda; instead, they have appeared slightly frothy.  However, I just remembered from looking at the ingredients (which I have posted on this website) that both illy issimo Caff&egrave; and illy issimo Cappuccino have potassium bicarbonate.  Perhaps the potassium bicarbonate will cause the coffee to spew if shaken.  Why do these products contain potassium bicarbonate?  Commonly found in club soda, potassium bicarbonate softens the affects of effervescence.  It is also used as a fire suppression agent (""BC dry chemical"") in some dry chemical fire extinguishers.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Cappuccino is recommended for coffee drinkers who love sugar and cream in their coffee but think Starbucks has too much in their products.  Perhaps you are a long-term consumer of Starbucks products and you desire something different; illy issimo Cappuccino would be worth trying for a change.  I wonder if the Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, will be offering free samples of the illy issimo coffee drinks.<br /><br />Joseph B.

"This coffee had two strikes against it: it was decaf, and it was already ground. I do use decaf, generally in a 50/50 mix with full strength caffeinated coffee, but I always like to grind my own beans to assure freshness. Still, I thought I'd give this Melitta coffee a shot (it was free from Vines, after all). I'm happy to say it surpassed expectations. I made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black, as I always do. It's surprisingly drinkable, if a little on the light side. Still, the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey, though I do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides. (There's really not much aftertaste at all, truth be told.) It's as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee I've ever had, and having it ground as opposed to beans really doesn't seem to be an issue here. Ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean, so I'd suggest using it fairly quickly, but that's easy to do with a 10-ounce bag. If you're a decaf drinker and prefer not to have to grind beans, I'd highly recommend this brand...","Had my doubts, but I'm impressed...",4

So we all tried this candy bar.<br /><br />My thoughts:  it feels somewhat ""grainier"" or ""grittier"" than a smooth Ritter Sport (or even a Dove or Hershey bar).  I also felt it to have a slightly bitter aftertaste, almost like a coffee bean flavor, but there is no coffee in this one - just cacao beans, sugar, milk, soy lecithin, cocoa butter and vanilla beans.  So overall I don't like it.<br /><br />Hubby says ""It's good"" and asked for more.  That's about all I could get from him.<br /><br />Son says, ""It definitely has a hint of bitterness, but that's very good.  I like it.  Not overwhelmingly sweet.""<br /><br />I wouldn't buy it again because I dislike the gritty texture, and I'm the primary chocolate buyer in the household :-  But you may like it.",Mixed reviews from the family,4

"My kids (almost 4 and 1) love these crackers.  We always have a box in the car.  They are healthy and tasty - much better for kids than Goldfish.

My little one sometimes sits on them in her carseat and gets stains on her clothes and also on our couches ;-) .

Which has its pluses and minuses, in my opinion. I like to take tea with me when I go out to eat and it's much more convenient, for me, to have one tea bag in a package, rather than four. But, how picky do you want to get? And, is it enough to keep me from purchasing this product again? I'm not sure?

"****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br />****","Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats",4

"I like the Super Slimming tea because if you are constipated, the herbs incorporated will most definitely get your digestive system moving very quickly.  I would definitely not go too crazy with the number of bags you use per drink and I wouldn't even drink it every day (unless you haven't had a bowel movement in a month!) as the Super Slimming tea can definitely bring on diarrhea if you're too aggressive with drinking it (i.e. I drink one cup at night...by the 3rd night, my bowel movements are REEEEAALLY soft).

I particularly appreciate being able to buy 100 sealed bags at a time from Amazon, because that really lowers the price. And as long as you can set aside the minimal storage space, it isn't as though sealed tea bags go bad!<br /><br />Chai Spice Black is my preferred morning tea blend. It has more caffeine and more flavour than the other teas I drink later in the day. It's tasty and smells good, and the tea is consistent from bag to bag (to bag to bag to bag!

"Three of the six hard taco shells were chips upon arrival and two of the remaining three had minor damage, so we ended up making taco salad with part of it.  The hard shells tasted great when crisped in the oven as directed.  Soft shell tortillas were fine.  Salsa was minimal quantity, but adequate for tacos (taco salad needed more).<br />Directions -- What You Need: 1 lb lean ground beef; 8 oz. shredded cheddar (or Mexican blend) cheese; Chopped lettuce and tomatoes; and Sour cream  --> it's not a complete meal in a box, but does include: 6 flour tortillas for soft tacos; 6 hard taco shells (see above about breakage); seasoning for the meat; tiny package of salsa; and unsweetended Kool-Aid mix.  You brown the meat, drain, add the water they failed to mention above and the seasoning mix, boil, then simmer 10 minutes.  MEANWHILE, crisp the hard shells in the oven and warm the soft shells (removed from foil packaging) in the microwave.  Total prep time is about 20 minutes.<br />The Tacos were delicious -- must be the special seasoning packet that's included.

"I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.  Like others, I was unaware these were for 'pod' brewers, although this has been since updated to state in the product description.<br /><br />In fact, the box has NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back to Amazon to find out about using 8oz of water per cup.  A little less Marley/Jamacia on the box, and a few more instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Since I don't own a pod brewer, I tried using a pod in my 'cup at a time' brewer.  All I got was slightly flavored hot water.  Not recommended.  Next I tried brewing one directly in a cup by adding boiling water.  While I got flavor, I also got sediment and aftertaste.  Again, not the recommended method.  Finally, I tried snipping open a pod and just using the loose grounds in my 'cup at a time' brewer with a standard paper filter.  I realize this is not the way the manufacture intended their product to be used, but as I said, since I was unaware this product was for 'pod' coffee makers, it was the best I had to work with.<br /><br />At last, I got to taste Marley's Organic Coffee in a good way.  Overall, I did like the taste (I drink mine with creamer).  Although I have to admit that I would not buy these at such a high price for just 15 cups of coffee.  Maybe if I had a pod brewer, I would.  But I really don't taste that much different to any other cup of good coffee.  As I said, I am not a coffee connoisseur, just someone who enjoys a good cup on occasion.<br /><br />This box of Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee includes 15 individually foil wrapped coffee pods, so that each cup will be as fresh as the last.","Pretty good, if you have the right brewer",4

"Kraft Velveeta-brand cheese has been around for many years.  I remember having the brick of Velveeta in the refrigerator as a kid growing up.  Kraft is obviously branching out, using the Velveeta name on a line of packaged food products.<br /><br />In the modern era, food is all about being fast, tasty, and nutritious (the latter far down on the list, sad to say).  Velveeta definitely meets the first two criteria.  Being chicken-based, it probably is about average for all boxed meals.  The chicken is not including in the box.)<br /><br />This is a creamy blend of pasta, broccoli, and (added) chicken.  The spices are moderate, not too hot, which is just how I like it.  It's filling because of the cheese sauce and the pasta.  It can fill you up quickly enough, to give a nice satiety after a moderate-sized portion.<br /><br />Of course the real question is, would I eat this again?  If it were moderately priced, yes, I would.  It's above average in taste, filling, and fairly easy to make.  Recommended.",Surprisingly tasty,4

I love kippered herring and while this is good there are some better brands on Amazon. The sauce was watery with hardly a hint of horseradish taste. I guess I gave it four stars because I like herring so darn much but now that I think about it maybe 3 1/2 stars would be more accurate.

"I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.<br /><br />First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.<br /><br />Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.<br /><br />All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be.",Illy Issimo Coffee Drinks,4

"Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count<br /><br />The Marley Coffee comes in single-serving pods, however I did not have a single-serving coffee maker to test these pods. Instead, I tore open the pods and used my Frieling Stainless Steel French press. I let it steep for about 30-40 minutes as I do my morning routine and let the water cool to a drinkable temperature.<br /><br />The coffee is best described as a medium roast. The taste is very mild and actually complements my breakfast very nicely. There is no bitter aftertaste, and it does not smell or taste burnt. I'm not a coffee drinking expert, but I can definitely tell you this coffee tastes great. I usually prefer my local Kona blend or Italian and French roasts for their stronger flavor, but the Marley Coffee is mild but tastes good. I wouldn't say it is coffee flavored water, but it isn't very strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, I'm not a fan of single-serve pods due to the higher cost. It is a mild tasting coffee, so those that prefer full bodied dark roasts won't like it.","Not a strong coffee, but does taste great!",4

I'm not an iced-tea drinker, so I can't speak to that.<br /><br />I'd never heard of this blend before seeing it on Amazon.  I can't always find Twinings, but this was a better unit price than when I do find Twinings of any kind. Aside from helping to preserve flavor, the individual-bag packaging also makes it handy for adding to a gift basket or tucking into a birthday card, especially since it's a somewhat unusual blend.<br /><br />I didn't give this the highest rating simply because there are other brands (Jackson's; F&M) and blends that I like better than this one, but this is still a very nice tea.",Aptly named,4

I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.,Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.,4
"i had earlier bought a box of timothy's 50 breakfast blend kcups and not only got a great tasting coffee, but fast shipping. at the time, timothy's was the only seller i found that sold in this large amount. so i bit the bullet and paid the $7.95 shipping. the kcups arrived in 3 days and i didn't have a single problem with any of them.<br /><br />when it came time to buy more, i reordered from timothy's again. after waiting and waiting and getting down to 3 kcups, i came back to amazon to see if my favorite breakfast blend from green mountain was available in the 50 kcup size. it was, and i jumped on it because i really didn't want to go to town to buy a small box while waiting.<br /><br />the kcups i ordered from amazon came 2 days later. still no timothy's box in sight. it finally arrived today, 10 days after the original order. to say i'm disappointed in this is an understatement.<br /><br />there are two reasons i'm returning the timothy's coffee. 1) i got the green mountain 50 kcup pack considerably cheaper than the timothy's coffee. in fact, when i ordered the green mountain kcups i also ordered some apple cider kcups [2 boxes of 24 each]for my husband and between them it was less than a $1 more then the timothy order. 2)since i got the first box i ordered from them in 3 days, i feel i had a reasonable expectation of something similar with this new order. i wasn't even able to track the package [i'm not sure why that was, maybe because it came from canada?] so i had no idea when it would arrive. on top of that, they are not only making me pay for returning the box, they could also take a 20% restocking fee. but that's ok. they'll only get it this one time.<br /><br />i gave this a 4 star rating because the coffee really is great if you're looking for a medium blend coffee that doesn't remove your taste buds. unlike many other reviewers, i didn't have any problems at all with any defective kcups. as much as i love the coffee, the price and iffy shipping times doesn't lend themselves to repeating the experience.",Very Disappointed in  Timothy's,4

"I used to purchase this coffee blend at BJ's Wholesale when I lived outside of Boston. Hadn't found it locally when I moved away, then discovered I could get it through Amazon. Hurray! So mild & mellow, just enough hint of Kona to make it worthwhile. Compared to supermarket coffee this is miles ahead in smoothness. Caveat: I spent a year in Hawai'i & had real, 100% Kona coffee, which this product makes no pretensions at being. But for the price, you wouldn't have expected 100% Kona, would you? I'm just pleased as punch that I can keep my coffee jar stocked without breaking the bank or resorting to bitter-tasting supermarket coffee.","Excellent, mild flavor, smooth tasting coffee",4

My daughter was put on this because the other GS was making her constipated. First they tried soy but it didn't help. The only downfall is she seems to spit up more. But her bowl movements are normal and she is not half as gassy and belches much easier. She also prefers the taste of natural cultures to enfamil ar lipil which i tried because of the spitting up. I have to mix the two. Sounds outragious but it works for her.,Helps with constipation,4

"I was interested in trying this so I ordered a case. I must say it was very easy to make. Looking at it, it does not look appealing. In the box are a can, topping, and also the biscuit mix. You have everything you need in the box but you need to buy or have milk. This is how you prepare it:<br /><br />* Open biscuit mix and mix with ½ cup water (I used warm, mix until lumps are out) place to side<br />* Take can and open and place in ungreased glass pan<br />* Add seasoning mix to can contents<br />* Mix 2/3 milk to seasoning and can mix in pan<br />* Add 9 biscuit drops to top and bake!<br /><br />The can consist of sauce, chicken, celery, potatoes, peas, and carrots. I took the celery out and even all the chicken. I knew it would be low quality chicken but it was not appealing at all. I might add Swanson white can chicken in the future. I took a picture of when it was done and also when I served it and uploaded it to the photo gallery.<br /><br />Above was my first attempt at making it, it is so simple! It is also great to serve leftover and heats fast. I would say it serves two hearty servings for adults. The next time I made it I added a can of cream corn to the pan and also a small can of carrots and peas. Adding more vegetables and the cream of corn, made it delicious! I am sure when you make it you can add what you desire. At first I was going to give this only 3 stars. I did not hate it but did not love it either by looking at it. However, tasting it, it has an incredible flavor! When it was done I only sprinkled a little pepper on it and it taste great! For the flavor it gets 4 stars!",Easy to prepare and hearty tasting,4
"I have a Pasadena popcorn machine from The Great Northern Popcorn company, so I though I'd try their pre-measured popcorn packets. Previously, I have used Vogel's pre-measured packs and compared to Vogels, this stuff is a bit saltier. It's very good, but Vogels is identical to movie theater popcorn in flavor; sweet, buttery, and more of the true corn taste then this.<br /><br />You can always reduce the amount of butter salt, or not add any at all from the packet. For my comparison, I used the entire packet contents which to me, produced popcorn with a bit to much saltiness.<br /><br />If you find this popcorn to be to salty, try Vogel's pre-measured packets.","Very good, but a little overboard on the salt",4

"What I expected were almonds covered with a chocolate glaze, like the ones you'd get at the movies, except dark instead of milk chocolate. These aren't that.

"I ordered these thinking it would be a fun thing to try. As some have described the taste of the tablet is not pleasant but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's going to make you gag or vomit... just unpleasant. It takes several minutes for the tablet to dissolve and frankly you either have to swallow a lot of saliva or spit at least a few times during this process... The package directs you not to swallow the contents but it seemed pointless to spit it all out. I decided to try to keep it all in until it was at least dissolved and I cracked it a few times to speed up this process. I also had a friend swallow the contents and they didn't experience any negative side effects, but this was just their experience.<br /><br />We had a good selection of sour foods and drinks set out to sample. Several different types of citrus (lemons, limes, grapefruit etc), pickles and pickled veggies, Worcestershire Sauce, Vinegar, Hot Sauces, ect. I'm sure you could get much more creative but these are just a few things we tried. The lemons and limes tasted amazing and sweet but you could still feel a bit of burn on your tongue same with the vinegar and hot sauce. The taste was altered and sour became sweet but your other senses such as smell and the sensitivity of your tongue remain and certainly effect the experience... for instance I can't stand pickles and while I ate them and they weren't sour... the smell was still revolting.<br /><br />The effect lasted for about an hour and sweet foods and drinks taste VERY strange during this time... even unpleasant. We all experienced a horrible after taste when eating or drinking anything for a couple hours after the effect had ended... it seems like it takes a bit of time for things to taste right again.<br /><br />All in all still a good experience and the product worked completely as described.",Works exactly as described...,4
"My cats are crazy for this food, including the one that has turned up her nose at all wet food for 6 years! Unfortunately the price makes it prohibitive as an every day meal since I have 5 cats. Also, I've heard that too much fish is not healthy for cats, they need meat too and they aren't that crazy about the Petite Cuisine Chicken.  I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish - it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the ""gravy"". I thought maybe if I bought human tuna in oil and spiked their usual soft Friskies, they would enjoy it more, but that didn't work, so I continue to buy Petite Cuisine.","More like ""human"" food than Cat Food",4

"Actually, this is a very good beef soup if you know a strick how to pour the soup out. Before using this soup, you should let container stand for at least few hours to keep all sweet powder and cinnamon staying in the bottom of the container, then when you are ready to enjoy the soup, you pour soup out gently and slowly in the pot. By doing this way, you will get only clear soup and all the sweet and cinnamon power staying in the bottom of the container, but you have to feel when you should stop pour out the soup. When I feel the container is very light, about only 1/10 of the liquid in the container and I stop. By doing this way, the soup is not sweet and not taste like cinnamon anymore, since then I love this soup because I don't feel thirsty after eating this Beef Pho soup. This Pho soup became my favorite because I can enjoy at home anytime and add extra thing I like as good beef, fresh slice of ginger.<br /><br />The first time, I tried this Pho soup, I didn't like it because it was so sweet as other reviewer wrote.

"I was really happy when I found this deal on Amazon!  Great price for my Cheerios!  However, I did see the note about the packaging may contain more and different information... I figured how bad can that be...<br /><br />When I opened my first box this morning, the first thing I noticed was the package inside was short. I didn't care too much until I poured the Cheerios into the bowl.  When I stopped pouring and stood the box back up a bunch of Cheerios slid down the inside of the box between the packing and the box!<br /><br />So to avoid wasting some Cheerios each morning I'll need to tell everyone in the family to lift the bag up above the box top before you pour your cereal in the morning (which probably won't happen much).<br /><br />The bottom line is these are so cheep because they are factory rejects.  The interior or exterior packaging may not be up to standard.  I would hope that they would all (at least) be sealed, but I'm sure you could get a little more or a little less cereal than what's printed on the box (hence the disclaimer on the page).<br /><br />So as long as you understand what your signing up for then this is a great deal.

"I am a picky coffee-drinker. I LOVE my Starbucks lattes.  I have been trying to cut back my 3-cup-per-day consumption, however, which led me to Dandy Blend.  I didn't expect it to taste like my Starbucks, I was just trying to appreciate it for its unique flavor.  I have to say it's a lot better than I expected.  I still prefer good coffee, but if I had to choose between Dandy Blend and cheap coffee, I would choose Dandy Blend.  It tastes a lot more like coffee than I thought it would.  My kids love it (they are 4 and 8).  I warm up some milk for them and mix it in and they have ""lattes"" with Mommy.  This way I don't have to worry about giving them too much sugar and Dandy Blend is good for the liver, among other things.  It's also a good substitute for hot chocolate for them, which I don't give them often because of the sugar.  But you have to drink something warm and creamy when you come in from playing in the snow.

"This is first time I had ever tried or heard of Melitta coffee, though I had used some of their filters (which I like).  I drink coffee everyday (about 3 cups in the morning) and like ""between roast""--which is between medium and a dark coffee.  I also like coffee that is not bitter but has a strong kick to it.  I tested a medium roast from Melitta and found it to have a pleasant smooth flavor and was very nice to drink.  It was not bitter at all.  I tried it both black and with sugar and cream and enjoyed it both times.  I generally do not drink black coffee but this brand was pleasant when served black.  I usually drink Community Coffee (a local Louisiana brand) and enjoy that brand's strength. Melitta does not have a strong flavor or ""kick"" to it.

"Tim Tams are the most amazing cookie ever created. Just bite off both ends and suck a hot drink through it (like coffee or my favorite, hot chocolate). You gotta wait until it's about to fall into the drink due to over-saturation and then SLAM IT! (That means put it in your mouth and eat it.)",Tim Tams rock my face off,5

"Besides the quick delivery of this product, I used it this past weekend in a beer can chicken recipe I devised from watching experienced chefs. First I injected the bird with the Creole seasoning and rubbed with the Cajun spice that accompanied as a kit. Added fresh garlic to the beer and with the help of the Masterbuilt Butterball Buttery Creole Seanoning Kit created the most exceptionally moist and flavorful chicken I had ever tasted!!!!!!",DELICIOUS,5

"The other flavors of Amazing Meal sound rather yummy but they contain ""Natural Flavors""  this is the only version that does not.  I even went to their website to make sure.  The addition of natural flavors is the only reason why I chose their Original over the others.<br /><br />I find the flavor is somewhat bland & absolutley is grassy!  Lately I've been mixing it with organic coconut water.  The quality of the coconut water affects just how tasty my ""meal"" turns out.  Sometimes I will add a few drops of organic liquid Stevia.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about this product that keeps me coming back for more.  I use Amazon's Subscribe & Save for it!  I'm not nuts about it, yet here I am drinking another glass!<br /><br />It is a quick & convenient way to get something nourishing into my body.  I find it is very refreshing.  I have never used it in a smoothie but when I do, I think it will be out of this world!  I have also mixed this with organic almond milk, organic rice milk & organic coconut milk.  The rice milk tasted the best probably because it was the sweetest.  The coconut milk was so so.  For now, I plan on sticking with the coconut water because I think it is the healthiest option & it tastes good enough for me.<br /><br />Overall this is a great way to get your greens & more in one quick ""meal"" though snack would be more appropriate as I don't find it filling for long.  Usually I pour a small amount of my liquid of choice into a glass, add a scoop of this (scoop is included), use a fork to stir it really good.  Then I add the rest of my liquid of choice & do lots more stirring.  I leave the fork in the glass & stir as needed because the fiber bits tend to settle on the bottom rather quickly.  Thankfully the amount that settles is substantially less than other mixes I've had.  I had a Organic Hemp protein shake that I flat out thought was disgusting & nearly all of it would settle on the bottom of the glass so fast I couldn't help but waste it! I'm sticking to Amazing Meal from now on.  Lesson learned!<br /><br />If you want to do something healthy & want to avoid all sugars & artificial sweeteners this mix is the way to go!  All Organic & GMO free!  If you are one of those sugar junkies who gets those ""fast food"" smoothies thinking it's healthy when it's just a sugar bomb you will surely hate this stuff.  For the rest of you health nuts lets raise a glass in good health!",Amazing Meal ORIGINAL,5

"As a grandmother of 3 little ones, I'm delighted with this product.  The one who's currently enjoying this loves holding onto and feeding himself out of the pouch and usually gets his veggies this way.  He was annoyed when we tried to feed him with a spoon as, at the age of one today (!) he's trying to be his own man.

"I had Turtle Island tortilla soup before, it was very good but I can't find that in the local markets, that's why I checked into Amazon and looked for it. Instead I came across the comida loca soup mix reviews, people seem really like it, so I ordered some and tried it out myself. I really enjoy the soup, it is very tasty and easy to make. I won't say it tastes better than Turtle Island brand, but it's definitely a lot cheaper. It cost about half the price of the other brand, but it taste just as good as the other brand. I'll definitely buy it again. Thank you for the reviews.",This soup is super.....good,5
"I have tried pills, (Stacker, Hydoxicut, etc). I tried the drinks, (Rock Star, Amp, coffee,etc). But all of them made me jittery and made me feel uneasy, even before an intense workout. I go to the gym at 5:30AM everyday and take one of these on the way out the door. As soon as I get halfway to the gym, I cannot wait to hit the weights! Now sometimes I will add a sugar free Red Bull on leg day, but one of these usually does the trick on regular days. I love this stuff. I hate the feeling most pills and drinks give me. This stuff just makes me feel alert.",Perfect for the caffine sensitive,5

"I love giving and receiving these for the holidays and Christmas.  It's fun to sample the flavors and one truffle, individually wrapped, is enough for a treat.  The dark chocolate truffles are actually good for you, say nutritionists.  The wrapping is quite festive and sparkly and indicates the flavor inside.  They look pretty in a glass bowl or pottery.  My sons love these and so do their friends, so it's a treat anyone can enjoy. The chocolate tastes rich and ""gourmet"", and I love the distinctive flavors.  These seems to have popular appeal so any hostess/host should be glad to receive them.  They can put them out for guests, or save them for their family to enjoy. It's a quality gift!  Or get them for yourself as a special treat.",Great Gift Idea,5
"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what Wheat Germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and does provide an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1]- Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2]- Substituting Wheat Germ for bread crumbs in Meat Loaf, veal/chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!",DID I FORGET TO MENTION? -- IT TASTES GOOD TOO!!!,5

"My Isis loves salmon so I always buy food that contains salmon as the ingredient. When I visited PetSmart and saw Nature's Recipe I gave it try, it has salmon as the main ingredient and it had no meat-by-products or fillers - very important to watch!<br />She loves it!! before she would only eat at night and during the day she would eat more Whiskas Temptations snacks which all the cats seem to be highly addicted to, but ever since she tried Nature's Recipe with Salmon, she eats it during the day and night - i make sure to watch her weight but the bowl is empty the next day!! and she's eats less snacks during the day - even better!! I just purchased a second bag today and the lady at the store  - only found at Pet Stores -  told me that this is a very popular brand among cat owners especially the salmon recipe - true I noticed the shelves were almost empty. I'll continue to purchase this one for her. The price is reasonable too and at the store they always have a special offer going on! Check it Out!! They also have Nature's Recipe for Dogs :D",Great for your Cats!,5
"I have been forced into a sugar free lifestyle for health reasons and have been trying to find a decent toffee / caramel SF candy for a while. I was skeptical with the malitol on the ingredients list. So far nothing with malitol tastes ""RIGHT"" to me. But Judy's Candy Co. smacked one out of the park on this. I picked up Vanilla Almond Caramels, Butter Toffee, and Triple Treat today and OMG so so good!!",Finally,5

"Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a ""sweet"" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!",Delicious!,5

"Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)<br /><br />Just received in the mail today: Nutiva(tm) brand Organic Hemp Protein Powder.<br /><br />I have tried many, many kinds of protein powders. I have hated them all, for one reason or another. Most of the time it's because they're pre-sweetened with aspartame or saccharine or even straight-up sugar. I'm not really ""into"" too much sweet stuff. Because I have to consume untenably massive amounts on a regular basis, protein powder will need to be as unobtrusive as possible.<br /><br />I wanted to try Nutiva's hemp powder because it also had a lot of other nutrients in it besides protein, and because all of these nutrients and protein were naturally-occurring, not chemically combined to form some alien mud substance.<br /><br />Right away I noticed the difference. This stuff was powderized, but it's like powderized grass clippings -- olive-green in color, with a smell not unlike alfalfa hay.<br /><br />And this stuff isn't artificial. Besides 11g of protein for every quarter-cup of powder, it also has Omega3 fatty acids in it, and a few other goodies.<br /><br />I love the nutty flavor it lends to food. It changes the appearance of food, however, giving it a khaki-green cast, and it changes the texture of it a bit with a grittiness.<br /><br />It's great in smoothies. Not being a big sweets-consumer, however, I also try to mix the hemp powder into other foods. Mashed potatoes is an interesting choice, particularly if you don't mind consuming green mashed potatoes! It can also be stirred into sauces.<br /><br />I like it WAY better than any other protein powder I've ever tried.","High quality, and a change of pace",5
"These were a change of pace so to speak. I thought they were very good flavored tasted good. Over all I have had lots of different brands, flavorings and such of tortilla crackers/chips but I think these were unique first the multigrain thats something new in a tortilla to me and I thought that was tasty ,then they added the olive flavoring . I loved it instant hit with me I would definitly buy these anytime i seen them in a local grocery or back on amazon someday . I think they are unique  and something as I said a different pace and taste definitly worth getting others interested in trying.",Very Good,5

I was a bit skeptical on ordering a Spirulina bar.  It is soooo green.  I must say it is one of my favorites to eat before going to the gym.  Not grainy nor too sweet. It gives me just enough energy to work hard without exhaustion.  The small size is just right so no need to save half for another time.<br /><br />It is an excellent edition to a raw diet.,Awesome taste,5
My kids absolutely love these apple chips - especially this Granny Smith version. They seriously act like I'm offering them candy or cupcakes when I give them these as a snack. I think they're tasty too - just the right texture and tangy taste.,My kids LOVE these - me too,5
I just switched my 11 and a half year old Boxer to this food and it is awesome! She switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food. It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:),Great Dog Food :O),5
"This is one of my favorite coffees. I used to buy it ground in bags locally but they stopped carrying it. It's smooth, light and not bitter at all. Beautiful caramel/nutty undertones give it a very nice after taste. I just wish this wasn't as expensive. I've recently been hooked on Tully's Kona Blend because I can get it locally at reasonable prices.",Yummy!,5
"A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow.

"I few years ago I tried the current 'commercial' peanut butters out there: Peter Pan, Skippy and Jiff. After tasting each, I felt that Skippy tasted the best overall. When I was looking for some Skippy PB to get my fianc&eacute; one day, all they had was natural (it was all on sale at the grocery store). I picked it up and hoped for the best. This PB tastes SO good it's ridiculous. The honey flavor is subtle but appreciated. And you truly DON'T have to stir it. So it's healthy and tastes great.",Tastes so good!,5
I have tried many different coffees and have never experienced tasting such an excellent coffee like Weaver's organic blend whole bean coffee.  It is very full-bodied and sweet.

"I did not buy these from Amazon, but apparently will in the future.  I was in my local membership-required-big-box store (am I allowed to say Costco?) when I saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving.  Since it's very easy to return stuff there, I bought it.  As others have commented, it's unusual looking, in that just the familiar looking K-Cup ring and foil at the top are there.  The plastic cup around the bottom is missing.  But that doesn't matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture.<br /><br />Off course, being green doesn't matter if the coffee tastes bad.  In this case, it does not.  It's got to be one of the two best French Roast K-Cups I have ever had.  Full of flavor, without being bitter or burnt.  I went back to the store a few days later and they had sold out and they are not sure of plans to get more, so it looks like I will continue to buy my coffee from Amazon, but instead of my usuall brand (Green Mountain French Roast), I will be buying these.","Great tasting, less waste",5
"I wanted to try my hand at making my own bread, so I purchased a bread machine.

"This is great food; it has natural ingredients and is formulated to be as close as possible to a cat's natural diet. I switched my kitten to this food with NO issues, not even the smelly stools others complain about and I'll explain why. I am into body building and diet and I know that when you switch from bad food to good food, you actually need to eat less and adjust from there.<br /><br />The smelly stools occur when there is undigested (unused) protein in the stools. Thus you need to balance your cat's food intake and exercise so that he's getting enough food for his or her energy needs. Too little and your cat will definitely let you know, too much and the stools will let you know.<br /><br />I feed my cat Innova Wet and Dry food, leaving dry food out all day with one serving of wet food in the morning or at lunch time. Unless my cat has finished all his food early on in the day, I don't feed him any more of either; no matter how much he meows (it took about a week or two to change his routine). Also, if he's finished or nearly finished his food by the time I go to bed, I don't refill his bowl till morning.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend consulting your vet and watching your cat closely while adjusting his feeding. Watch for energy levels, alertness, responsiveness and overall demeanor.","Great food, feed sensibly",5

Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.

"I love tea especially during the cold months. I found this item and loved the price for the quantity I got. The description of the ingredients was interesting. I love it!<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful. As soon as I opened the pouch at work, the entire office was filled with it. Everyone who walked in commented on it. The taste was wonderful, too. The scent is floral with a cinnamon flair to it. You don't have to brew it. Just having the bag open fills the air with that smell.<br /><br />The taste is sweet. Not too sweet as I cannot handle anything that has too much. This is just the right amount. You don't have to add sweetener to it including honey. It's perfect the way it is.<br /><br />The pouch is resealable and great for the lose leaves you get in this order. You might find that you use it so much that sixteen ounces is not enough.",Wonderful Taste and Aroma,5
"These peppers are not your ordinary peppers. I would definitely not recommend eating them solo.  Mixed with Salsa (either queso or regular) they definitely add a nice bite.  I only used one in a small container of salsa and they really added a great spice.  With queso, the effect was much more subtle.  When I mixed it with mild salsa I got quite a kick from it. I love spicy food, so this was a great deal for me, but if you are more inclined to a milder version, then queso is a better use.","Hot enough, but use carefully.",5

"I would give it more stars if I could.  Our first baby absolutely loved it when he was younger, and it is extremely good for the baby with all of the different nutrients that the baby needs.  We got our first can from a friend of mine and then proceeded to buy more of it from amazon.com and ended up buying other kinds as well made by the same company.  The price is great, too.

"I have several cats and have made a point over the years to feed them high quality cat foods.  My female at 15 years was getting oily coat and would not move around much...she just didn't seem to being doing well.  I read ""Natural Cat"" and had a real eye opener to what is really in these pet foods - even the higher quality ones.  I shifted the cats to ""Pet Guard"" wet and dry food. Premium feast is a great flavor they love. Within 2 weeks, the female's coat was 1/2 as oily plus she was moving around measurably more than before.<br /><br />After a month and a bath with Pure Castille soap - she is oil free and doing Great. She also lost a 1 lb which I attribute to better nutrition proteins and not fillers.  I also use Organix Cat food.  Consumers need to educate themselves on GMO (genetically engineered corns, soy etc.) - not only is this crap in our foods now but heavy in pet foods...I am true believer shifting to Organic, even in the pet foods, is our best bet. I mix it with Tabby Tab or Nu-Cat vitamins as well as PetGuard Anitra's Vita-Mineral Mix Natural Pet Supplement - Huge benefit.<br /><br />Stay away from Tuna fish - I know they love it - I used to feed premium whole tuna cat food fillets but it is not good for them -plus the mercury content is always a factor. PetGuard does have a seafood flavor they like and it does not have tuna.  Good luck!",Good Quality - worth trying.,5
"These are essentially the yummiest, most delicate wafer cookies I've come across. The hazelnut tastes exactly like Nutella, perfect. Each little cookie is 0.5 Weight Watchers points, which is terrific for those of us watching our figures. I usually have four cookies (2 points) with my tea and am VERY satisfied. They taste so decadent. I'm going to try the Lemon next and hopefully will be able to track down the Espresso flavor!",Delicate Hazelnut Wafer Cookies: Magnificent!,5

"It is sad to see people rating on a pet food product based on whether or not their pet likes the taste, but not based on the ingredient of the good. When their cat doesn't eat, they give one star. When their cat loves to eat, regardless of the nutrition of the food, they give 5 stars. It is unfair to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this seems like the trend of pet food rating.<br /><br />Newman always make good healthy and nutritious pet food. They contains no corn gluten, animal by-products, etc that will be harmful to cats. Yes, they are pricey because they are organic. Once a while Amazon runs a promotion on Newman's Organic cat food, and it will be the good timing to stock them up.",Newman makes nutritious pet food,5
"""Only my hair dresser knows for sure,""  Well I don't know about that, but the folks at Amazon know how much cat food I order (on account), both dry & wet foods.  Before I even offered Newman's Own Organic Chicken & Brown Rice formula to my five cats, I could see the difference.  Upon openind the first can, I was so pleased to see real chicken broth (organic of course). It was clear broth just like boiling chicken on stove top. It was really fresh looking too., So then the real test when offering to the three indoor cats.  All three approved.  I given only small portions at one time, yet my kitties cleaned the bowl, eating right up!  Never, ever do I recall when my kitties have been so accepting of their wet food. I've owned and cared for cats for over 25 years, and this food really impresses me! I now order it via ""Subscribe & Save"" (Amazon program) and it will be delivered at regular intervals.  The first case was damaged in shipment (3 or 4 cans were damaged so bad that the contents were running and dripping from the carton. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious as usual and are sending a new case for my accomodation. The only concern I have at this time is that this particular formula is ""out of stock"" and currently not available from Amazon, though it can be purchased from WAG.com.  I also make purchases from WAG.com and though their prices are slightly higher (most of the time), they are also a great company and have a good variety of foods for both Cats & Dogs, as well as other pet items.<br /><br />If you've never read Newman's Own QA report and product description, be sure to do so.

"This is really good chocolate. The chocolate bar contains almond chunks in just the right amount. The almonds are nicely roasted, and so add a wonderful flavor burst to the bar.

"This is absolutely the best powdered (or any type) formula I have found to date. It is the ONLY one I have seen that doesn't have corn syrup as the second ingredient on the package. My son had a hard time adapting to formula because of a lactose sensitivity in other brands. We tried Similac and the only kind he could digest was the Similac Sensitive. Even then, however, spit-up and gas were regular issues. Switching to Earth's Best eliminated both completely, and I feel so much better giving my child an organic product. The family Naturopath I go to also said the nutrition balance was excellent, and we only supplement with a small dose of Vitamin D.

"I mainly use my Keurig for coffee but thought I'd try this one since I love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews.  I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried, but I don't really feel like making a big scientific study of it.)  This will be my source of hot chocolate from now on.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains.  That sort of thing worries me a little.  Still, I don't drink hot chocolate that much, so I think I'll survive.  I'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories 60, from fat 20.  Trans Fat 0g. Sodium 200mg. Sugars 6g.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: sugar, glucose syrup solids, cocoa (processed with alkali), partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), modified whey, maltodextrin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium caseinate, cornstarch, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, sucralose, mono- and diglycerides, silicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color. [Contains milk and soy.]<br /><br />(I always hate seeing artificial coloring in ""dark"" chocolate products.)<br /><br />If I had hot chocolate every day I would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals, but since I enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my Keurig on the occasional whim, I'll just keep a box of these K-cups on hand.  I highly recommend it for the taste, it isn't easy finding good hot chocolate.",Dark chocolate lover - best I've tried,5

"The taste of this canned cappuccino style drink hits my sweet spot, literally.  If I had to describe it, it's basically very similar to Starbucks' mocha frappuccino - milky, very sweet, with a good coffee base smoothed out by a little cocoa.  (Of course, if you find that flavor combination too milky or too sweet, then this isn't for you).  The finish leaves some coffee and sweet notes, and the 8 ounce can was just right for a tasty, 100 calorie liquid snack.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the product currently seems overpriced at over $2 per can.  I didn't knock a star off for the price, however, because those can change frequently.  If you like the sound of a sweet, milky cappuccino drink and can find this at a price that works for you, then I highly recommend it.","Very Tasty, but Pricy",5

"I've used a few different kinds of GF flour including Bob's Redmill and Gluten Free Pantry and other rice flours. This one is by far the best in terms of taste and texture for all the baking that I've done with it. I love that it has recipes on the back of the bag for all sorts of breads, bagels, and other baked goods. It even includes directions for use with breadmakers. It's so easy. And the results are tasty. The breads to turn out more dense than non-GF loaf bread from the store, but that's the case with most breadmaker breads.

"Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ"">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0"">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.",I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea,5

I LOVE this product.  I would do without food before I would do without this.  The benefits are multiple - it helps keep you regular and also helps take the stress and tension out of your muscles.  It does take 4-6 weeks to notice full change in your muscles.  I certainly don't feel the stress in my upper back the way I use to - and I still do the same type of computer work day in and day out.

"This is my second bottle of The Source now and I must say, if you have never experienced real hot sauce, you are in for a big surprise. This stuff is not to joke with friends about as you can seriously injure someone with it used inappropriately or against the manufacturers' guidance.<br /><br />If this is your first time tasting real hot sauce, one drop per pot of chili is more than enough. This is not the hottest stuff available but it is one of the best ""hot to price"" ratios you will find. It has a rating of 7.1 million scovial units where I think a habenero pepper is only about 500,000 units. The high end sauces range around 14-16 million I believe.<br /><br />Having a chili cook off soon? One or two drops of this in the entire pot of chili and you'll be a sure fire ""hottest!"" category winner I bet.<br /><br />Do not eat this stuff directly from the bottle ... do not give it to children and be sure to wash your hands 4-5 times if you get it on them.

"I ordered a box of 24 of the variety pack of these after trying a couple of different flavors from my cafeteria at work.  This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip, but have fewer calories and taste better.  After trying the variety pack, I really love the BBQ flavor the best.  My husband really loves the sea salt and vinegar flavor.  I do enjoy the cheddar potato as well, but we are subscribing to receive the BBQ and the salt and vinegar on a periodic basis since those are our favorites.  The original is rather plain, the parmesan and garlic is very garlicky, the salt and pepper is OK, but I'm just not a huge pepper fan so I'm probably not a good judge.  I really don't enjoy the sour cream and onion which is interesting because I do enjoy that flavor with other chips.<br /><br />So bottom line, great chip, great alternative to other chip options.  Low calorie, low fat, and the subscription option is really convenient since I can't seem to find the individual bag option at any store in my area.",Yummy low cal chip,5

"Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command. It also taught him important problem-solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.<br /><br />The Non-skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing. My dog chooses to use his teeth to pull up the pieces not his paw, so slob is usually all over this toy. I'm so glad it's plastic!<br /><br />Its a must have because it provides hours of fun, and I encourage anyone with a curious doggy to get one!!!",The Paw Hide is a great little toy.,5

"The fruit flavors are my favorite jelly belly flavors.  I never buy the regular jelly belly mix, because it has too many flavors that I don't like, and that I continually accidentally eat.  Like the awful buttered popcorn flavor (WHY?) and black licorice.  I was happy to see that there is a fruit bowl mix.  The only flavor that I do not like in this mix is coconut, and since those are the only white ones I can just avoid those.  No more accidentally eating a flavor that I hate!<br /><br />I was a bit surprised when my order arrived in bulk packaging, in just a regular bag that was closed with a piece of red tape.  I would have liked if the description made that more clear.  It never said that it would arrive in official jelly belly packaging, but I just assumed it would anyway.  It made me a little nervous at first, but all the positive reviews of the seller (in my case, it was The Candy/Cosmetic Depot) convinced me that it was safe.  It did arrive very quickly, at least.  That's not relevant to the actual product review though, just thought I'd mention it in case someone else is also expecting it to come in an official jelly belly bag.  I'll still give the fruit bowl mix 5 stars.  Even though (or possibly because of the fact that) I keep finding myself unable to stop eating them until after I feel sick from too much sugar!",Yum.,5

"I LOVE Bengal Spice.  I think my problem with most teas is that I always have to add a sweetener or cream or something to it to make it tolerable.  This is perfect the way it is.  There's a definite cinnamon taste, but there's a subtle sweetness as well.  Kind of like a cider.<br /><br />This was suggested to me since I love Chai lattes so much (focus on the latte, not the tea). And it serves as a great, cheap, calorie free substitute.<br /><br />My only issues are:<br /><br />1. It seems to have stopped up my regularity, if you get my drift.  I've basically had to supplement my diet with more pure fiber.<br /><br />2. I can NEVER find it in stores.  They either don't carry Celestial Seasonings (odd), don't carry this flavor(odder), or are completely out of stock (not odd at all...but frustrating!). Thank God I can load up in bulk via Amazon. Note to Celestial Seasonings, please feel free to use this review to push more sales in grocery stores.  As it is, I've changed my shopping locales to (the few) stores that carry it.

"What I like about this cookie:<br /><br />The size: It's not huge, but definitely large so one is quite filling.<br />The taste: Very nice, subtle blend of oatmeal, chocolate (real pieces) and almond pieces.<br />The freshness: I don't usually like boxed cookies. They tend to be unexciting and dry. But these cookies are specially wrapped individually so that they maintain freshness and softness.<br /><br />True, one must handle them gently as they do crumble easily. If one does that, they shouldn't crumble. I find they taste especially nice with coffee, hot or iced.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this cookie and am looking forward to finishing the box.

"The various Friskies ""party mix"" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites. Especially the Beachside Crunch version. He used to be a treat fanatic, but lately he hasn't been eating as many treats because he's been filling up more on wet food; that's sort of replaced his ""dry treat"" routine. However, he usually will still eat the party mix if I give it to him, even if he shuns other treats.<br /><br />And one other great thing about party mix - the price is cheap, but you get a lot for your money, since it is a good-sized bag. Great taste, great value - what's not to like?",Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats,5

"Fog Chaser is my favorite coffee and I buy it in whole beans for when I brew a full pot.  I have used it for years and would not think of changing.  When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel.",I love Fog Chaser,5

Both of my cats love this toy but one of them plays with it far more than the other because he won't let his brother near it.  He even lays underneath it and just swats at it when he gets tired. I hung this on the door of an armoire in the living room so we could watch the cats play with it...not just because it's fun to watch but because they are prone to biting in half the string of any toys on a string and then trying to swallow the pieces.<br /><br />Sometimes one will grab the mouse in his mouth and try to walk away with it only to have it bounce away due to the elastic string section-hysterical! Then they get all fiesty as the mouse bounces all over from the tension. I think the elastic section of the string is what really makes this toy fun for them -plain string would not have done the trick. It makes the mouse so bouncy and squeaky. They still haven't managed to bite the string in half yet and it's been several weeks -probably because they can't keep hold of it long enough to chew through!,"Bouncy, squeaky FUN!",5

"So despite this saying low-glycemic, it actually does have sugar, though much less than other brands (5g per serving). It is also mostly gluten (wheat gluten) free.  The grains are oats, quinoa, amaranth, millet, and buckwheat. The flavor is mild and tastes more natural than other brands, none of that super artificial flavor. It is great on yogurt (I use plain soy yogurt and add real fruit, granola, and a dash of chia seed).  It is also great in almond milk as a cereal (again, I'm vegan here).  It's tasty as a snack.

"I have been using stevia products since at least 2008, originally as Stevita, a product that has the consistency and spoonability of sugar.<br />Like Stevita, Truvia has the consistency and spoonability of sugar. Like Stevita, Truvia has no calories. It is an effective sweetener, and in the spoonable version I'm reviewing is quite easy to use in many ways. The envelopes of Truvia are handy to carry with, but ripping them open spills a little bit on the counter, when using a small spoon with the jar version might well be neater.<br />UNLIKE Stevita Truvia is widely marketed, except that it's not in a Target store in the Chicago suburbs. It is even available in my local fairly small supermarket in West Philadelphia/University City. At one time the supermarket carried the jars, but then there was price drop on the envelopes and that is now all they carry.<br />I agree with another reviewer that Amazon is taking a cue from one of its sellers, and is charging an outrageous price for 3 jars of Truvia. A little goes a long way; I am really not sure I want to spend twice the price of 3 jars in the store, to buy 3 jars from Amazon. Would I even use up enough in a year to justify the purchase?<br /><br />It's a good product. Keep looking until you find it at a semi-reasonable price. It does cost more than sugar. On the other hand, the benefits of no sugar high, and reduced calories, make it worthwhile.",The best available stevia product,5

"I brought this tea with me to the hospital when I was in labor. I drank around 3 cups of this tea per day.

The raspberry and fig flavors are nicely balanced, and the filling is generous.<br />I can't think of a way to improve on these.",Way better than newtons,5
It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.<br /><br />I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />They come with a long expiration date also.,Best Sugar Free Cookie~You get 8 as a serving :),5

"I first bought Genova Tonno in olive oil a few years ago from an upscale market near our downtown apartment. It was on clearance for half price (&lt; $1 for 5 ounce can), so I picked up a couple cans. Wow! this tuna was the way I remembered it should be. Solid packed, moist, and not a floating mess of tuna bits you find now in those cheap Chicken of the Sea and Starkist products. I immediately bought out the remaining dozen cans, and was sad when I finished the last one.<br /><br />Since then we moved from the downtown, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it still at some of the Milwaukee area Pick N Save stores. It usually retails for about $1.90 and is rarely on sale. I think the last time I bought some, I saved a nickel a can. It doesn't matter, because I always know it'll be good. I can eat it plain, but a little mayo and I get two hearty sandwiches out it.<br /><br />So ignore the water canned stuff and buy this if you see it in your store or here on Amazon if you don't. You won't be disappointed.",This is what canned tuna is supposed to be!,5

They are what they are, with no apologies.",They Are Great For What They are,5

"These Stroopwafels were absolutely delicious and arrived intact! My husband made an instant request to order more and  I will be doing just  that. These lovely cookies are perfect with coffee or English Tea. If your cup is the perfect size to let the Stroopwafle sit on the rim of your coffee mug or tea cup, let it sit on top of it for two minutes for each side. This allows the caramel in the middle to melt just enough to give you a delightful mouthful when you take a bite. Don't leave it on too long other wise the cookie will soften and fall in your cup.

"It's very hard to find organic, decaf, AND Swiss Water Processed coffee on the market, but here's the one! I had no other option so I tried this coffee, but we've been having this ever since! This is the best decaf coffee ever we tried, and most of the time, nobody realize this is a decaf. Very strong, but not sour at all, perfect for dark coffee lover. I really can't tell if it has the flavor of raisin at all, but maybe hint of chocolate. Swiss Water Processed (SWP) coffee is any chemical trace free, cleanest coffee you can have. Frequent coffee drinker always should seek SWP.","Best and rare organic & Swiss Water Processed coffee, ever!",5

My husband just made these for me after I picked up the mix last week at the grocery store. All I can say is these are DELICIOUS!

"I am a native New Yorker. I grew up loving Mallomars. Much to my shock and surprise, this amazing delight is not known in some parts of the country. It turns out, if you read the box, that 70% of Mallomars are sold in the New York metropolitan area. Here is what the rest of you have been missing. A mallomar is a round cookie with a blob of marshmellow on top and then covered with a semi-sweet chocolate shell. You may not like marshmellows; you may not even like the cookie, but the combination is pure magic!  It's without question, one of the most addicting treats I have ever eaten.<br /><br />New Yorkers don't need me to tell them this. But then they don't have to go to Amazon to order them. Mallomars are available in supermarkets there. You can't find them where I live now. But happily they are available right here. I have eaten through my first shipment (a gift from my wife) and I am now ordering a refill. Amazon ships them fresh and well protected. All the cookies arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />Excuse me, I need to go open another box.",Absolutely the best cookie in the world,5

"planters has this NUT-rition line of nuts for everything from heart health to men's health.  i'm not sure all the different options make all the differences they claim or if this is a marketing scam to charge more for something that is ""specialized"".  either way, the nuts are very good.  i enjoy the combination of almonds, peanuts and pistachos.  the ratio seems about equal, maybe with a bit more peanuts than anything else.  low carbs at 5g and there is sea salt added.  overall, very tasty and recommended even if you're not a man.",good mix of nuts,5

"And it's only 130 calories!  Sure, if you eat a ton of these it'll outweigh the `good for you' and replace it with `OMG THE SUGAR' (18 grams a bag) but, in moderation this is a great snack.  These bad boys don't even taste `low calorie' at all.  Instead, they taste every bit as unhealthy as the real thing.  So grab a bag and snack away.  The popcorn crunches, the caramel coats and the chocolate melts in your mouth!","Salty, chocolaty, caramel goodness...",5

"I have an 11 month and 3.5 year old. These pouches make for a great yummy snack. My kids love to eat them right out of the pouch. My older child eats her whole veggies and also these pouches. My baby, is not a huge veggie fan like my eldest.. she loves these however. When I cook for the baby if I don't hide the veggies well, she will reject the meal. So, when I can't get my baby to eat the organic veggies I have made or when I need a quick snack while shopping or out and about, Ella's takes great care of us! Def a must have. Oh, I just give my baby the whole tube and she sucks it all out.. great for the baby who had always refused me feeding her.",Great for babies and toddlers!,5

"This is one of the best new products I have ever tried in a long time.....These are delicious chips, they taste like chips, ( not styrofoam) and are all natural !<br />The Barbeque are outstanding, as are the plain, sour creme and onion, salt and pepper. I don't love the Cheddar or the Salt and vinegar, they are a bit strong.<br /><br />If you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points, and are a great find to cover the crunchy/salty crave, If you are not on weight watchers, you will still enjoy them. My husband loves them, my co-workers love them, kids love them. They can not believe their Mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a day!<br /><br />Overall an excellent product !",Great Natural Potatoe Chips With Low Calories!,5

"My small dog loves his new food! Due to allergies, he only eats raw food.  This is by far the best and easiest food, preparation wise, that I've purchased thus far.  He devours every morsel, however, I do recommend mixing it with another food in order to prevent weight loss or increasing portion sizes.  At first, Ewee (he looks like an Ewok) lost a considerable amount of weight on this food, so I had to increase his portions to compensate.  Other than that I think it's a great, healthy product!  Oh yeah, and it lasts for at least a month.",Shitzu loves it!,5

"I have tried several brands of coconut flour.  This one is clearly the best in flavor, texture, and ease of use.  I love the convenient one-pound packages(I usually buy in groups of six and refrigerate all of them). The packages are not so easy to access on a daily basis, so I open one and pour the entire bag into an airtight container which I store in the refrigerator. Works great!!",Best Coconut Flour,5
"While I love most of Kashi's bars, I can understand why some people find them to be too bland, too granola, etc. I just have to echo what other reviewers have noted.

Then I can only feel sorry for your taste buds.",Hard to go Wrong With Coconut + Dark Chocolate,5
Zukes is a treat my puppy loves and is good for her.  I bought the salmon flavor and the 1 lbs. package lasts a long time which makes it a great value.

"After drinking Costa Rican Peaberry coffee that was given to us as a gift and drinking Community Coffee Cafe Special for years and watching the price rise and rise, I decided to search for Costa Rican Peaberry coffee here on Amazon.  I didn't find any Costa Rican Peaberry, but came across this Tanzanian Peaberry.  I read the reviews and decided that for the price, it was worth giving it a chance.  It isn't as strong as the Costa Rican Peaberry, but with the addition of a bit more (probably as much as I usually put with my Community Coffee) it should be to the strength that I like it.  Other than that one little issue, it has a yummy flavor!!  I will definitely purchase this coffee again and again!!",Great Coffee at a Great Price,5

"Ever since reading about Consumer Reports selection of 8 O'Clock Columbian (not their other offerings), me and my extended family have been delighted with this affordable performer. It is utterly mellow and caramelly. I'm a firm believer in grinding my beans right before use, using fresh, filtered not-quite-boiling water, stirring that beautiful mixture up in a stainless steel French press (better than constantly replacing broken glass decanters!), waiting about 3 minutes to steep, and then pressing and pouring that frothy love into a waiting mug. It's surely the only way to make it through this crazy days--starting off with a perfect, fortifying cup of 8 O'Clock Columbian. Sometimes, if I'm feeling the need for a little extra smokiness, I'll add just a tablespoon of French Roast beans to the mix (I prefer Peet's and their glistening, almost fishy-smelling charcoal-colored beans). But make no mistake, it's the 8 O'Clock Columbian that makes it work.",the foundation upon which to build the perfect cup of morning brew,5

"I like oolong tea, but everything I could find locally was either mixed with black tea or was very weak and came in compressed nuggets that wouldn't expand properly in water.  I even tried several local Chinese import stores to no avail.

When I first bought this tea, I thought the price was a little high, but you can steep the leaves multiple times to get quite a lot of tea.<br /><br />I liked the tea well enough to sign up for a delivery subscription.",This is a Strong and Flavorful Oolong Tea,5

"I made my 1st child's food using a pot of boiling water and steam basket, then transferring it to a bowl and using a kitchen aid hand blender. It was such a chore and so much clean up. I always felt I had to do 10 pounds of carrots to make it worth my time thus making it an even bigger chore and there'd be a few chunks I just couldn't get. Then of course freezing in ice cube trays and all that hassle. Plus when boiling water on the stove, I occasionally would forget about it and burn my pot. Now that I have a toddler and 6 month old and working full-time, I was tempted by the baby bullet commercials, did some research and decided to try the Beaba instead.<br /><br />I LOVE IT!!! It's no longer stressful and a huge chore. I can easily throw in a couple carrots while I'm cooking dinner for everyone else and now there's dinner for all. The food comes out so smooth. I don't have to pay attention to water boiling on the stove. I can just let it steam and it turns itself off when ready and then I can puree when I'm ready. Clean up is as easy as top rack dishwasher. I leave the lid off the water container when I'm done as I read the reviews on mold, so I've had no problems there. If you question whether to spend the money, I would say it is totally worth it. It pays for itself in a couple weeks/vs buying baby food especially if you have a big eater like I do. Highly recommend this thing.",This thing is the greatest,5

"I am a ""cheese straw connisseur,"" and have purchased many brands before.  These are by far everything I expect from a quality product.  First of all they have ""ALL NATURAL"" ingredients, with real Cheddar Cheese being the first listed ingredient.  The taste bears it out.  The other thing is that they have just the right amount of ""bite.""  A bit of cayenne pepper to make the taste terrific.  I can't stand real hot foods, so this is perfect for me.  The last time I had cheese straws this good was from Sam's Club (a Christmas special),  and Geraldine's taste equally delicious.  The price here on Amazon is really good.  Other brands are more expensive in the store and the quality is not quite as good.  I'll definitely be back for my cheese straw fix!",Everything You Expect from quality Cheese Straws!,5

"we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly. we decided that we had nothing to lose and perhaps it'd make her last days or months more pleasant if we took her off her natural supplements (glucosamine,msm,yucca), as well her pharmaceuticals. at the same time, we decided to change her dry dog food from a well-known brand we got at the supermarket to a more natural one. we did research and decided on Wellness Simple Solutions. we chose this one specifically because it had so few ingredients. lily was having alot of g.i. problems - she frequently vomited and it contained alot of mucus;she was itching alot and developed very scaly patches on her skin. she was a mess! her zest for life was disappearing. But, that was 3 months ago! lily no longer vomits; her itching has improved 85% or more; her coat is shiny and beautiful (people admire her wherever she goes); she goes on 45 min. leash or free walks/runs now, where just 3 mos. ago she was only able to go 15-20 mins. i attribute Much of her recovery to Wellness. it's so gratifying to see her feeling so Well again!","dogs,too,are what they eat",5
"""Paradise Tropical Tea"" is a brand name, not a description of the tea itself.  China Black, as per description, is the tea type itself. This tea is a good strong black tea that makes an excellent iced tea.  I have tried the ""tropical"" and it is OK if one likes flavored drinks.  I prefer the basic. I have been using this tea for several years and would be very disappointed if I had to make a change in brands.  I used to buy it by the case at my local coffee shop, but their distributor quit handling it.  So now I am here at Amazon.<br />  My recipe for ""Espresso"" tea is as follows. 2 pouches of tea in the carafe of a coffee maker and put in 4 cups of water per bag in the reservoir and hit start.  Let stand 5 minutes then remove pouches.  Then I put the tea in the fridge.  To serve, I mix a ratio of tea to water according to my currant needs and taste. A couple of shots of tea to a glass of water.",Paradise Tropical Tea,5
"When I took my 15-year-old, overweight cat in for a senior wellness exam, the vet. said the x-ray showed serious arthritis.  I just thought she wasn't getting out of her cat bed because she was elderly and tired.  The doctor prescribed Adequan, but either I didn't get the medication into her muscle properly (entirely possible) or it just didn't work for her; I saw no difference.  I tried Cosamin, but my cat seems to be able to smell it, no matter how carefully I mix it in, and won't eat even tuna if it has that in or on it.<br /><br />Then I saw these in a store.  Although I was certain they wouldn't work and doubtful my finicky cat would even eat them, I figured, What the heck -- it's worth a shot.  Wow!!  After a few days, she started perking up and moving around, and now she acts more like the cat I knew a few years ago.  She even ""smiles"" more!  And crucially, she still loves these treats -- she doesn't seem to get tired of them.  She is (as I mentioned) overweight, so I give her 3 a day.  I wish they would make them in more flavors than just chicken and salmon, but like I said, so far, she hasn't gotten tired of them, even without the extra variety.  Thank heavens for these treats!",I'm in shock!,5

"I contacted Muir Glen directly and asked whether or not their cans contained BPA. You can see their response below:<br /><br />""Thank you for contacting Muir Glen about bisphenol-A or BPA.<br /><br />Bisphenol-A is a component of protective coatings in metal food packaging, and provides an important food safety and quality function in canned foods. Scientific and governmental bodies worldwide have examined the science many times and have concluded that the weight of evidence supports the safety of BPA, including recent comprehensive assessments in Japan and in the European Union.<br /><br />In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced another review of BPA. This review in expected to take 18-24 months, and Health Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO) will participate.<br /><br />Most metal cans in the food industry utilize BPA in the can lining or can lid. Some of our products do, and many competitors' products do as well.<br /><br />Muir Glen continues to believe BPA is safe. However, we know that some of our consumers have wanted us to pursue alternatives. We have been working with our can suppliers and can manufacturers to develop and test alternative linings that do not use BPA for some time.<br /><br />One alternative has proven safe and viable in our processing of tomatoes - and Muir Glen is in the midst of transitioning to cans with liners that do not use BPA. It is an approved non-epoxy alternative. Can coatings used by Muir Glen also comply fully with all applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for safe use in food contact applications.<br /><br />Your views are important to us.

"I have two terrier mixed breeds and have been feeding them Acana for years. Acana and Orijen are made by the same company, but because Acana is a little cheaper, I go with that. People may scoff at the prices, but when it comes down to it, a 30 lb bag of your everyday dog food costs almost the same as Acana or Orijen but does NOT compare in quality and nutrient availability. One of my dogs has terrible allergies and if I feed her ""normal"" food, she gets terrible dandruff. However, when I bring her out, everyone mentions how soft and shiny her coat is. My vet remarks that her teeth are in amazing shape (no plaque). She has never had bad breath one day in her life nor has she ever been overweight! I attribute this to her diet. She is 49 lbs and she gets two cups per day of Acana, any type, though Grasslands, Pacifica and this have been the best (the others I admit are too expensive for me, and I don't feed chicken). I don't feed wet food, but she does get one or two treats per day as well. My other dog is 30 lbs and she gets 1.5 cups per day as she is a little porker and will find scraps around the house wherever she can. This dog does have bad breath, which we are realize is likely due to digestion. We have switched from Pacifica (which is very high in Omega oils) to this one and her breath has vastly improved. My vet said that terrier breeds usually have poorer digestion, and high fats can cause some bad breath. I am buying Lamb & Okanagan Apple from now on. I trust this company and appreciate the efforts they put into their product. I have also e-mailed the company to ask about digestibility and they took the time to e-mail me back with thoughtful insight. I hope you try this brand and like it as much as I do!<br /><br />On a side note, I also have a cat. I feed him Acana dry as well as Tiki Cat wet at night. I have gone through FAR less dry food with the cat than I have with any other brand as he seems fuller from it through the day. What a great buy!",One of the best dry dog foods.,5

"When our oldest son had a reaction to a cashew and was rushed to the ED, we knew he had an allergy.  Little did we know, that day would change our lives.  Giovanni had to be antihistimine free for 30 days before being tested for allergies.  After having the test done, we discovered he had treenut, peanut, fish, egg, wheat, oat, and carrot allergies.  I was crushed.  No parades, trick or treating, holiday baking, etc.  Reading lables on EVERYTHING.  Then, I got a ray of hope.  Sunbutter.  With the help of Sunbutter our holiday baking can be done.  We didn't realize how many of our favorite holiday treats have peanutbutter in them.  I've used Subutter in cheesecake, cookies, bars, and obviously, sandwiches.

"One problem I've experienced in caring for an older dog is finding a glucosamine supplement that our 65 lb., 15 year old Akita/Chow-chow mix would really like eating.  Finding one that our dog, Kuma-chan liked eating was a challenge.  We've tried tablets in her food and she would smell it mixed in and not eat until the next day.  Other biscuit type supplements were left uneaten.  Sometimes the gel capsule would be left at the bottom of her dinner bowl.<br /><br />As soon as the Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint Peanut Butter Large Dog Biscuits arrived, I offered a biscuit to Kuma.  She took it, wagged her tail and came back for another one!  Now, she knows that she only gets one every morning before her chicken jerky treats!  It's great when you don't have to force feed your best friend!  What a relief to see Kuma walk with minimal stiffness or pain in her hips after a couple of weeks.","Tastes so good, she looks for it in the morning!",5

"For YEARS, I have been a coffee snob, preferring Starbucks to any other brands.  Yet, my health issues have made it very clear that coffee and I must part ways.  I searched for all kinds of coffee substitutes online and read honest reviews before deciding to purchase the Mediterranean Java Teeccino at my local Sprout's.  At $8.29/bag, I knew I was taking quite a risk, but...it was totally worth it!  I enjoy Teeccino guilt-free without the unhealthy consequences of coffee.  I sure do miss that caffeine rush, but I sleep better now, my moods are more even, and I have more energy in the day as opposed to the highs and lows that coffee has done to me.  My coffee addiction did a number on my teeth, on my gut, and on my mental health.  I finally feel like I am almost free from this addiction!!!  Teeccino is a wonderful replacement for coffee and I don't have to feel guilty drinking it (though I'm going to try and find a better deal on it from now on).<br /><br />To be fair, not everyone agrees.  My husband thinks it smells and tastes like paint.  My hopes were dashed with the smell as the first pot brewed, but the taste is very full-bodied like coffee and I love it.  Can't please 'em all!

"Not Flat or old- looking, like some other canned pumpkin brands.

"These dried tart cherries are excellent and a real buy but only when ordered through amazon.com (rather than Traverse Bay) in the 4-pound box.  We get them to help with our arthritis, taking 10 morning and evening.  You will know within a week whether or not they will help, but most of our friends have found they help.  Of course a piece of cherry pie would have the same effect, but these are lower calorie and much more portable!

"lavazza has been a huge brand over seas since Columbus. This specific roast is a creamy full bodied REGULAR coffee. I drip brew it and consider it one of the best availible, period. The ground is even incredible, and actually has a just as fresh taste as the freash ground beans[really]. Full bodied, but not strong flavor like a French roast.<br />It is the only cooffee I can think of that i will pay full retail for. That is saying ALLOT for me!!<br />Try It!!!",THIS IS NOT EXPRESSO!!!!!,5
I saw Rice Bran Oil talked about on Dr Oz.  He said that it doesn't turn into fat in your body and that sounded like something I definitely wanted to try. I'm glad I did.  There is virtually no taste to the oil.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you are cooking it with.  I've used it to saute garlic for pasta dishes and I couldn't taste a difference between the rice bran oil and the olive oil I usually use.  Another great trick I've found is for popcorn. I put maybe one or two tablespoons of butter in a bowl and mix it with a little of the rice bran oil.  Poured over a large bowl of popcorn it tastes like its pure butter. This is a great item to add to add to a healthy lifestyle.,Rice Bran Oil,5

"I just received a box of 50 of the Deidrich french Roast. Upon opening the box I saw coffee grinds meaning some kcups broke open.<br /><br />I made a quick call to amzn. Not so upset at losing a few kcups...stuff happens. More upset at the time it would require to wipe the grinds off of each kcup and then find and throw away the damaged ones.<br /><br />AMZN very promptly gave me a full refund and since it was a 'Grocery Item', they said to keep it or throw it away, but they couldnt take it back.<br /><br />Obviously I took the time to clean everything and kept the undamaged kcups.<br /><br />I recently tried EMERILS BIG EASY BOLD and like it very much. Tried around 8 cups to ensure the last was as good as the first.<br /><br />I wont put it at the top of my 'favorite kcups' list, but will say it was very tasty and worth ordering.<br /><br />Nice 'Parisian' taste.

"Eunice and David Bigelow have a real talent for producing relaxing caffeine free teas. ""Sweet Dreams"" is one of my favorite herbal teas. It contains chamomile, hibiscus, peppermint leaves, rose blossoms, spearmint leaves, spices and orange blossoms.

It is perfect to drink on a quiet night or in the afternoon.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",Wonderful Aroma,5

"I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.",I've eaten these for 15 years,5

The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future.

"Yum, I think that's about enough to say! These are an absolutely FABULOUS after dinner mint, not the usual mint either. The filling is very strong and refreshing, and can also spice up the after dinner coffee drinks you may be serving.  The center can be gooey but I've found that if I place them in the freezer, take them out about 30 minutes before serving, that this completely solves the problem.  I don't normally mind gooey myself, but I do know that others don't prefer mints with goo.  Great dropped in a mug of hot chocolate too - I'm known as the neighborhood gourmet hot chocolate lady! The dark chocolate adds an extra richness to a regular cup of chocolate.  Great, great stuff.  Highly recommend!","Sometimes gooey, rich peppermint!",5

"I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet.",My cats now love it!,5

"You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.",The Best Chips...PERIOD!,5

"I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand. I'm glad I did get this brand. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand. They were ""healthy"", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of ""junk"" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before.

I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.,Mild sweet tea,5

"I first heard about steel cut oats on the Oprah show about its health benefits.  First of all I DO NOT like regular oatmeal like you buy in the grocery store.  I don't like the slimy texture.  But I figured I'd try steel cut oats and I'm glad I did.  They are delicous and very good for you!  The warm nutty aroma when they are cooking is very appetizing.  I add a little bit of sugar or splenda and some cinnimon, it tastes fantastic!  I also sometimes skip the cinnimon and add a tablespoon of granola and/or some dried berries.  Excellent healthy breakfast.<br /><br />Normally these take about 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop.  I found a way to cut the cooking time in half.  Take 1/3 cup of oats, and 1 1/3 cup of water and put it in a large microwavable bowl.  Cook in the microwave on High for 5 minutes, stir, then another 5 minutes, then stir again, and then cook about another 2-3 minutes until the texture is just the way you like it.<br /><br />For those of you who are asking what the difference is between regular oatmeal and steel cut oatmeal:<br /><br />-Steel-Cut Oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into two or three pieces using steel discs. Golden in color and resembling mini rice particles, they are as nature intended - nothing added and nothing taken out.<br /><br />-Rolled oats are flake oats that have been steamed, rolled, re-steamed and toasted. Due to all of this additional processing they have lost some of their natural taste, goodness and texture.",I cannot say enough good things about this stuff,5

"I wasn't eating the old bars, so I have no comparison to what they 'used' to be like.  The bars are not moist, which is actually nice to me, as I'm tired of all the moist snack bars out there.  I keep these pretty readily on hand, and probably have 4 or 5 of them a week.  The individual price of these at the store is a bit high when you compare it to the overall size, but purchased from Amazon, the pricing works out to a pretty decent amount for what it is; a small snack.<br /><br />My wife, who is not gluten sensitive, even enjoys these bars, and keeps one in her purse for those low blood sugar moments when she needs food immediately.<br /><br />While they are on the dry side, they aren't so bad as some reviews have made them out to be.  I don't find it necessary to wash it down in order to clear it out.  It's similar to a more condensed brownie.  It's not overly sweet like a lot of the snack bars are, which is something else I was looking for.<br /><br />I've been keeping these bars in stock, along with other GF snacks, for the better part of a year, now.  I'm happy with them, and will continue to purchase them and keep them in stock.",A Good Snack,5

Maybe this was true at the time they wrote their review but as I have the pack in front of me, the label states ""sugar"" followed by ""fructose"" so there is no corn syrup to be found in these tasty snacks.  As someone with a sweet tooth who admittedly loves to snack, these are a godsend!  Definitely give them a try :)",A yummy and tasty snack!,5
"This tastes like real chocolate milk!  I've tried Slim-Fast, Muscle Milk, and other protein shakes, but I can't stand anything that has sucralose, aspartame, or any other artificial sweetener - they leave a nasty after-taste.

"So far, my cats appear to like this food. While I'm against feeding cats dry cat food, this food appears to be balanced in ways that other dry foods are not. From some reviews that I've read about this food, most people agree that it's a better quality dry food and made without many of the by-products. The only issue I have with it is the cost. Yep, it's much higher than others but I'd rather pay a higher cost and know that my kitties are getting a better quality food. Look forward to trying some of the wet food as well.",New to Wellness,5

"I have tried many (and I do mean many) protein drinks and I must say that CLICK is far above any of the others. What's not to like? Mixes quickly and easily (a common flaw with other powdered protein drinks). Low calories (120). Zero saturated fat. Negligible sodium (105mg). Low carbs (12g). Decent protein (15g). All of this with a 31g/2 scoop serving.  And, most importantly, superb taste PLUS a caffeine kick for workout momentum. You just cannot lose with CLICK, whether it's the Mocha or newest Vanilla Latte flavor. I must sound like a sales rep for this product, but in reality, I am just a regular guy at the gym who enjoys lifting weights and fat-burn cardio. I simply do not have enough superlatives to describe how much I like and enjoy this one-drink-does-it-all product. As far as I'm concerned, it is not only the best of the best, but the only protein drink I need or will ever want!",Best protein drink ever!,5

"I don't know how they do it - but this tea is sweeter than any other tea on the market.  I like full-bodied flavor in my tea and this delivers.  I also like blending this with other teas - like a green tea or vanilla to vary it's flavor.  I drink this every day.  As someone who can't have any sugar or sweetners of any kind, this tea is my daily cup(s) of something warm and wonderful.  It also makes great iced tea on a hot day.  Again - try mixing it with other teas, it's great.",I LOVE THIS TEA!!!,5

I counted on this stuff to get me through college once I moved out of the dorms and tried eating healthier (no health issues; I just wanted  to start being careful).

"I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well.",Fine Food for Diverse Cats,5

"I started using quinoa as part of healthier eating plan. In calories it is similar to brown rice but with a lower glycemic index. It contains all nine essential amino acids, making it a complete protein.<br /><br />I like eating it in different ways:<br />1)  A like quinoa as a side dish. It takes sauces very well.<br />2) I  like it cold to add bulk to the salad.  My favorite is to mix it with spinach with tangy dressing.<br />3) I like as a home-made cereal in the morning. I add frozen fresh berries which I defrost in the microwave just until they are slightly warm.<br />4) Quinoa has fiber to bulk up stool, and phosphorus to stimulate bowel movement. If you combine it with prunes as your morning cereal you get a real cleansing effect!<br />Here is my favorite recipe for this treat - tasty and effective.<br />1 cup of water<br />1/2 cup quinoa<br />1 pinch of nutmeg<br />1 tsp graded ginger<br />1/3 cup of chopped prunes<br />1/4 cup rice milk<br />Bring the water, quinoa, nutmeg and ginger to boil. Reduce heat and simmer covered for 10 minutes.  Then stir in the prunes and rice milk. Cover again and cook for 5 more minutes.<br /><br />Quinoa naturally grows with a bitter layer of saponins, to remove the bitter test Quinoa is pre-washed before packaging to remove the bitter shell. I was pleased with Ancient Harvest quality, I did not detect any bitterness in their quinoa.<br /><br />Amazon deal on the 12 box of quinoa is very good but you get a lot!  If you are thinking of trying it for the first time I recommend trying one box at a more expensive price to see if you like and if you like it go with the 12 box size order.

"This review is for the 24 pack of 3 Oz. cans of the Wellness Brand Cat Food.<br /><br />Objectively speaking...<br />The cans are easy to ope and they have consistently arrived in excellent condition.  There are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  That's all I can really say objectively about cat food.<br /><br />Subjectively speaking...<br />I could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  My cats are 15 and 16 years old.  They are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  I had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  I took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  The vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  After a conversation with a friend in Dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  I decided to do some research and was I glad that I did.  My cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes I've noticed.  My cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and I think that was because he was biting at some straw that I didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like I just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  And although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones I'd find in the house.  They have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  Don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but I've been told (and now I feel I can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  Actual cat food like the Wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  I must say that I felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.<br /><br />I will note that I also use the Wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  This is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case I am in a situation where I cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  For your reference I feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  I am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, I'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.<br /><br />And as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when I leave it out but they do not finish it all.  I do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  Some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months I have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  The longest I've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  There are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  I've checked and tried a few.  This one is really different.  There are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  Also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.  Be good to yourself and your pets!",Objective & Subjective (from a particular buyer),5

"My french bulldog developed SEVERE allergies at around 8 months.  Within a few weeks he was covered in bumps from head-to-toe, his hair fell out, he wheezed horribly, had really bad gas, went to the bathroom a lot and had loose stools.  I wasn't sure he would live, and the Vet said he had severe allergies, probably to his food, and put him on several months of prednisone and a prescription allergy food.  I was upset with the prednisone treatment as I knew it was dangerous and my dog hated the prescription food.  Two weeks later there was almost no change and he was still miserable, so I started researching my own solution for allergies, comparing food ingredients, and ideas to try.  I found that salmon/fish and sweet potatoes are not ingredients found in many other dog foods so an allergy to them would be more rare...and this food doesn't contain any grains or poultry products.  I started him on this and added a heaping spoon of canned pink salmon with it, and he still licks the bowl clean every time.  His breathing started clearing up within a week or so and I was able to stop giving him prednisone.  The bumps gradually went away after about a month and a half and his hair slowly grew back.  It took about 4+ months for 100% of his symptoms to go away, but he has been doing great for over a year now.  (For treats he is only allowed raw baby carrots, apple chunks, frozen green beans, or salmon jerky.)<br /><br />This food is an excellent option for dogs with both grain and poultry allergies as I can't seem to find another quality dog food that doesn't contain a little bit of chicken or rice, eggs, oatmeal, etc.  My only issue is that it is a bit low on protein, but since I add canned salmon to his food each day anyway isn't a problem for us.  The canned salmon and salmon oil are good for his skin so it works nicely, especially since he will eat the dry dog food just fine, but when I add the canned salmon he goes nuts for it.<br /><br />If your dog has allergies, try this!!  Don't let the vet sell you prescription dog food and put your dog on dangerous doses of prednisone.  My vet put my dog on the most common one sold; it was really expensive and I was so upset after I researched it and discovered that it has almost zero nutritional value.  (Look at petfoodanalysis. com as it does an amazing job of reviewing all foods and ranking them on quality ingredients, etc.)",Amazing for grain and poultry allergies!,5

I highly recommend this brand of subperb quality organic cinnamon.",Awesome stuff!,5
"Bravo for the new Eco Friendly Pod.  I actually forgot what fresh, real coffee tastes like.  At first I was taking back but the strong, robust flavor.  Then after a few sniffs and sips I felt rejuvenated.  For the first time since I got my Keurig I realized that I missed fresh brewed coffee.  The taste is so fresh, so lively, so good.  The price is also an added bonus.  This Crazy Coffee Mom is really hooked.",For Serious Cover Lovers,5

I have searched for good olive oil for years and one day my brother in law gave me a small bottle of Bariani olive oil he got in a specialty stoor on Marthas Vinyard. When the oil was gone we were lost. After calling him he told me to go on line and try Amazon. This is our third time and we get the large bottle of oil and the Balsimic Viniger they make to go with it. Positively the best vinager and oil going. We will not even try another brand. I cant wait to have a salad for dinner.,best oil i have found,5
"My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.",My dog goes crazy for these!,5
This is a great product.  Just a tiny treat tid bit that dogs seem to love but keeps them from packing on lots of calories.

"This is a better version of sugar than the regular store bought, plain white sugar.  A little problematic for recipes that require a lot of sugar, as it may measure differently than regular white sugar.  Also, I did find this later in Costco, a local warehouse store, at the same size, which is cheaper because of the shipping charge.  Still, a great product if you can't find it in stores near you.",Better Sugar,5

"A pair of these giant bags of your basic peanut M&M's sort of shrinkwrapped together, for the same price others are selling just one bag.  I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.

"This is my first experience with eating millet.  I decided to try it because it is one (of just a very few grains/seeds) that is acceptable on a low acid diet.  I was pleasantly surprised with the nice flavor of this seed.  I cooked it like I would oatmeal, for a hot cereal and I also used it to make a pudding like rice pudding.  I added cinnamon, raisins, and stevia (for a little bit of sweetness) and the pudding was delicious, as was the hot cereal style also.  I used the hulled millet because I wasn't sure if the unhulled would cook as nicely.  I think I made the right choice.  And, as always, Bob's Red Mill hulled millet was nice and fresh, as has been the other Red Mill products that I have purchased.",First time eating millet,5

"I've had my malty-poo, Chloe since she was 5-weeks (don't get me started on that...I was told she was 8 weeks when she was handed down to me).  I've gone through quite a journey with her but overall she is my little girl and I was meant to have her.<br /><br />We've gone through so many brands of foods and she's liked some (Wellness, Natural Balance, Blue, Ultra) and hated some (Instinct, Castor and Pollux UltraMix, Innova).  Halo seems to have become her favorite so we've stuck by it for the last four or five months and Chloe doesn't seem to tire of it nor does she show any type of allergies that I noticed with some of her other foods.<br /><br />Lastly, I discovered Halo because I heard Ellen Degeneres was co-owner and if you know anything about Ellen you know that not only is she a humanitarian but she also loves animals so I would hope that this is not just a money making venture for her but that she has put her name behind something that is truthfully healthy for dogs.  Chloe has grown up on kibbles along with sliced carrots, celery, apples and she also gets a boiled piece of chicken every few weeks.  She doesn't like just any treat or any food and she's been like that since we got her.  She likes her Halo and she seems comfortable with the size of the kibble along with enjoying the taste so that is the ultimate gauge.  In terms of price, we do the subscribe and save and it usually falls below the price Petco has.<br /><br />If you have picky eaters similar to Chloe's breed, leave me a comment if you have any suggestions, tips or stories of your own to share.",MY 18-MONTH OLD MALTY-POO LOVES THIS,5

"Hi His, I'm glad you gave us that hint as to where to buy White Lily flour!!  I just placed an order.  I wanted to correct what you said, however.  You can order up to 4 5 lb bags of whatever flours you choose for $16.95.  Shipping is still free.  Therefore, if you want 2 bags of self-rising, 1 bag of regular and 1 bag of buttermilk cornmeal flour, or get all four self-rising if you want - you can mix and match.  Great hint!  Much appreciated.. this is my first time using this flour.  I can't wait!",Great tip!,5

"I absolutely love Amazon and practically 'hang out' on Amazon like some people do on Facebook - LOL! That being said, I really enjoy reading the reviews and the comments of fellow Amazoners and learn so much by doing so. I really appreciate the information that other reviewers include and when I have found a particular reviewer that I recognize over and over again, I have clicked on their profile to read more about them and about what other items they have reviewed and BOY has that been fun!<br /><br />And that is precisely how I stumbled upon this Amazing Grass Green Superfood mix!<br />I was reading the profile of another reader and she raved about it. Well, any time I am out of my green powder, I order a different brand. This way, I am always using a different product and can try them all out and see which one I really do like the best and will stay with. As timing would have it, I was almost out of the one I was using, and saw this review, and ordered it!<br /><br />I signed up for the Auto-delivery (as you can cancel at any time) and it reduced the price as well as free shipping - yay! But, the real test was in the flavor, and it's blendability (new word?). It shakes up well (shake, not stir), and the taste is pretty good. I add it to smoothies, or drink plain in water or juice and like it either way. It seems to be economically doable for me, possibly lasting 60 days, so that is a better deal than most out there.<br /><br />I felt better immediately after drinking it - with more energy - probably due to the Maca. Maca is something you want to research before taking, and certainly before ever giving to children. I have some Maca in a bag, and when I have added only a tiny bit of it to a smoothie - I didn't like the way it made me feel at all, and it made my heart go a little crazy, so IMO, be cautious.<br />This, however, gave me a burst of good-feeling energy without the heart palpitations of other ill-effects, so I was happy.<br /><br />All in all, I think I have found my favorite green drink so I'm sticking with it and if I have any other opinions, I'll update my review.<br />I think you'll like it too!",What a great find!,5
"We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food. Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we've had them on. It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for!

We are putting them back on Canidae. It's worth it!!","Switched to a cheaper food, but going back to Canidae",5

"I've been hooked on French Market coffee ever since a trip to New Orleans in 1980.  The last few years I've been buying directly from the company online because it's very expensive to buy retail here in Seattle (yes, I like it MUCH better than Starbuck's). I prefer the medium-dark roast, both the Creole Roast (red can) and the Restaurant blend (white can); the two are indistinguishable to me. I don't know how to describe it other than it has a very strong, deep flavor, but is mellow, not bitter, which may be the chicory. I practically never grind beans anymore because I like the chicory component and the coffee stays very fresh in the can anyway. I really do use ~50% less coffee to make a pot, as they recommend, and that, plus buying in bulk, makes my coffee habit extremely affordable. I was happy to see I could get on a subscription buying plan through Amazon.com; hopefully,I'll be less likely to run out. Now, I just have to find a good coffee maker to replace my old Starbuck's Barista that has finally quit.",My favorite!,5

"Wow - Udi's has nailed it once again with some awesome bagels. The texture and taste are just like ""regular"" breads. If they're frozen, I recommend thawing briefly in the microwave (only long enough to pull the top and bottom apart) and then putting them in the toaster. I tried warming them completely in the microwave one morning and ended up with a very hard, chewy bagel. My only complaint is that it's alot to spend on 4 bagels (or 4 breakfasts) when I can spend the same amount for a whole loaf of Udi's bread. Granted, the bagels are rather large.",I Get to Eat Bagels Again!,5

"Bought a box of these from BJs before I found them on amazon. Let me tell you this is one GREAT cup-o-joe. I was a bit skeptical because of the kcup redesign but it brews perfectly in my B70.  I've been brewing kcups almost exclusively for the past few years, and as another reviewer noted I didn't realize how much I missed the smell of a freshly opened bag of coffee. These things smell Fantastic!  They come packaged in multiple vacuum sealed bags of 8 or 12 depending on the size box you order, I put mine in a vacuum sealed canister to store them on the counter once I open a bag due to the open bottom design of the kcup.  I'm really impressed at how full bodied this coffee is, I absolutely love it, kinda reminds me of a toned down version of  Timothy's Midnight Magic.  I think the thicker nature of the filter and open cup design allows for a more efficient extraction because this coffee turns out perfectly every time.  I also subscribed to the ""fog chaser"" variety which is very good but a slightly less robust cup.  For now I'm hooked on the rainforest!<br /><br />08/11/2012  Still loving the rainforest blend.  This is by far my favorite k cup of all time. This is the closest you'll get to a fresh cup of ""coffehouse"" coffee from a k-cup.  I just wish they would come out with a decaf blend also.",Fantastic K-cup!!,5
"Bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great! Too bad I don't have one of those machines, otherwise, I'd try them out myself.  I might have to consider getting one!

"You can't get better tea than Luzianne.  Tetley, Lipton, Rose Red, etc. don't even compare.  I love the delicious Orange Pekoe/Black Tea blend because it is the perfect combination of fruity and roast flavor.  My family has been buying Luzianne for years.  I just bought a 48 pack of family size tea bags at Walmart tonight and I love how large they are.  I've been drinking almost nothing but tea and water for about a week now because I am trying to wean myself of soda.  It has the perfect amount of caffeine to not cause headaches and it is really good for you -- if you don't sweeten it.  Tea has been shown to prevent cancer and diabetes!  Brew some Luzianne and you'll never look back!<br /><br />Just a helpful tip:<br /><br />I have tried several different brewing methods -- stovetop boiling, microwave boiling, iced tea maker -- but the best one that works is just heating the water until it is hot (not boiling).  I've had problems with it coming out too strong and this is just right.  Let it steep for the full 5 minutes.",Best Tea Blend Ever!,5

"PROS:<br />- As of 12/28/10 the price is $[...] for 25 lbs, which is $[...] per lb, and a very good deal compared to other products here on Amazon (specifically, Bob's Red Mill Quinoa)<br />- Item was shipped promptly and there were no holes in the bag.<br />- The quinoa was pre-washed: there was no bitterness to speak of.<br />- The quinoa was free of debris, particles, etc.<br />- Directions for cooking were spot on (I didn't add the salt, but that's just my preference)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- This is not a knock on the product, but more of an observation on quinoa itself: The quinoa texture is something I am not used to, and I would compare it to that of tapioca. If you are someone who has trouble with certain textures of foods, I would recommend buying a smaller-sized bag of quinoa to make sure the texture is bothersome.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /> - A fantastic product! As someone who is a very involved with weight training, this is going to fit my dietary needs perfectly.",Great product,5
Not many people know about this great dog food because the company spends their time on quality production vs. advertising.

"I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap.

I love liverwurst sandwiches too.  LOL.",YAY! I FOUND IT!!,5
Very good worth of money,Awesome,5

"Timothy's Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso is one of my favorites.  Don't let the espresso word fool you - it's full and flavorful, but certainly not a true espresso.

I've been buying vanilla beans at my local natural food store forever but decided that I need to find a cheaper source since I am using a full bean every week.  Two beans cost $10 at the natural food store.<br /><br />These Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla beans are fantastic.  They are plump and moist and very fragrant.  My only complaint is that they ship in a plastic bag--shipping is incredibly fast so the time in the plastic bag is minimal and I put them into a glass jar as soon as they arrive.  (My concern with the plastic bag is that the beans can lose their moisture much quicker if not stored correctly.)<br /><br />I will be buying more of these beans very soon.,The Best,5
"I am a 'butter lover'. I had to have butter on everything. Heard about coconut oil,tried it. OMG! Now I can't live without it. I use it for everything even to make garlic bread. Its the best.

"This matcha is a great first try matcha. Its got the amazing caramel sweetness and earthyness from the matcha. When you open the package you get the most amazing sweet caramel scent, it makes you want to just sit there and smell it.<br /><br />Smelling it you think its going to be so sweet but its not. The balance of this tea is fantastic. Its got a beautiful green colour. What can I say its just perfect. To me its a real caramel flavor, alot of caramel things have that weird fake caramel taste but not this. Its got a real sweet caramel taste that is so delicious.<br /><br />I'm very happy that I tried this as my first matcha.It makes me want to try them all now.",YUM!,5

A component of that diet is daily oat bran.<br /><br />We've tried a couple of different brands, but we like Bob's Red Mill the best. Both the flavor and texture are superior, and I like that it's organic. I also like the company - having seen them profiled in the news. They treat their employees well and even basically gave partial ownership to their workers.<br /><br />For use with the Dukan diet, I find the easiest  and tastiest way to prepare is to put two tablespoons in a bowl, pour in just enough skim milk to cover, then microwave for about 60 seconds. I add in organic cinnamon (cinnamon is good for blood sugar).",Best stuff for Dukan dieters,5

"I was unfamiliar with Arnott products until this purchase. I just received my order and am surprised at how good these are - indistinguishable from Carr's. The pepper flavor is just right - not too mild or strong. These are perfect for dinner parties or guests or make a great snack for yourself. I won't hesitate to order more of these or other Arnott's brand crackers. In case it matters to you, the packaging is very upscale and elegant so you won't be uncomfortable putting these out in their own packaging in front of guests.",Surprisingly good - a Carr's alternative.,5

A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack.",Seriously Delish!,5
"The jury is still out about the efficacy of curcumin (found in turmeric) as a treatment for cancer or Alzheimer's. Not enough testing has been done yet. But it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for about 4000 years, and there seems to be less cases of cancer and Alzheimer's in South Asia where it is consumed. So, who knows?

"I have to admit I'm a coffee snob, owning a semi-comm espresso machine at home and am heavily into all that coffee voodoo stuff.  Although I think Starbucks coffee is just so-so unless buried beneath lots of caramel and other stuff, I really like these VIA instants for some reason.  Maybe it has more a french press taste and experience than other instants that draws me to them, I don't know.  I do know that I will take these quick and easy to use instant packs over the cafeteria coffee any day.  Before folks get all on me about my contradictions, it's a personal taste thing.

I've had a LOT of raw chocolate bars. Nothing compares to this brand. I've tried all the different flavors and they're to LIVE for. I feel really healthy after eating some of this chocolate.

I think that it is the bright little taste of lavender that gets to me so much, but overall this is just a really great spice, a terrific mix of flavors that is completely unexpected. I hate to use the word ""unique"" because it's such a vague word, but this flavor is just that: a world unto itself. Oddly enough it's one of the few spice flavors that I can conjure up in my memory just by thinking of it--isn't that funny? If I just picture the jar in my head I can recall the flavor (and that's not as easy as it sounds!). Anyway, love the spice and I have to say that, as a previous reviewer said, this is the ultimate flavoring for an omelette: you put this on eggs once and you're hooked.

We are all dog people and so she asked me to take in another stray.  Soon after our little Juvie began to drag herself around.  We took her into the vets and her hips are really out of whack.  There was nothing we could do or afford.  She seemed happy but very inactive.  After I began feeding her the Happy Hip, which she loves, she began standing more and even playing with the new puppy.  I began feeding my other dog (he is two years old now), mixing the old food with the Happy Hips.  He will eat all the Happy Hips and leave the old food until I admonish him to finish his dinner.  Both dogs are really happy with Happy Hips.","My Juvie, Standing With Comfort, at Last!",5
"I was attracted to the new flavors, non-GMO corn, all-natural flavorings and bag, and the clean packaging.<br />And I was wowwed.  Loved the lemon and seasalt and the rosemary too.  Yes so it's a bit more than typical popcorn, but it's still inexpensive and you know that EVERYTHING is clean, green and tasty.  Good for a tasty snack, kids, and families.  Brought it to a little gathering and everyone loved it.",Wow! Tasty! Organic!,5
"They're mentioned in German Medieval sources before 1200 CE and archaeological evidence suggests that wheat noodles have been a staple of Schwabian cuisine for at least 4000 years. I'm fairly convinced this is true, since most of the packaged Spaeztle I've bought in the USA taste roughly that old. The etymology of the name is obscure, but most Schwabian housewives declare that it's derived from Schwalbe, the German name for the bird swallow. Or perhaps it's the Schwabians who are derived from Schwalben because their dialect sounds like twittering. Not a single housewife of my acquaintance has been able to suggest what the connection might be, leaving me free to speculate about the possibility that Marco Polo carried a bag of Spaetzle with him on his travels to the Khanate, where his attempts to translate the German into Chinese via Italian gave the Khan's chefs the idea of making bird's nest soup, the birds in question being swallows. However, there's also the strong possibility that all Schwabians are genetically Chinese, since their profile of frequency of blood types A and B exactly matches that of certain districts of Shanghai, which would certainly demonstrate that Marco Polo never actually traveled to China but instead heard tales of the place from various German Dudelsack players who were imprisoned with him in Genoa for disturbing the peace.<br /><br />In any case, Spaetzle are basically gnarly little egg noodles, usually served with meat dishes having rich gravies, when other cuisines might offer rice or pureed vegetables. Of course they're far better home made, but this brand is more than tolerable. There's a description of how Spaetzle are made on wikipedia, written in astounding detail, and you'll find recipes for appropriate saucy dishes on-line or in any German cookbook.<br /><br />K&ouml;stlich!",Marco Polo Didn't Bring These Noodles Back from China!,5

I drink alot of different varties of teas and this is my favorite. It may seem like alot of money to spend on tea but it's worth it.

These bars are great if you are sensitive to sugar. I have a hard time eating things that are hight in carbs with very little fat or protein. These bars are very well balance for an energy bar and I've never had a problem eating them. They taste very fresh and not as processed as most bars. They seem to be made of whole ingredients that you can see in each bite. They aren't too sweet and won't make your blood sugar hit the roof only to crash shortly after. They provide steady hunger relief. The flavors are wonderful. I love the peanut butter chocolate and the dark chocolate cherry cashew.,"Balanced, satisfying, and not too sweet!",5

"These cookies are rich and creamy with a wholesome taste. They don't have a bitter taste like most dark chocolate does, so if you're looking for a traditional bitter taste this is not it. They aren't as soft as bakery cookies, but not crisp as crackers either-they are a medium softness.There are 9 cookies about 1 3/4"" in diameter.<br /><br />The cookies are placed in a plastic container wrapped in a plastic bag within a heavy paper box. I opened a few boxes and looked in the window of the other boxes and none were cracked.

"I got a variety pack of Sahale mixes, and this was the only one i liked. The others just didn't work for me, though i only actively disliked one (sing buri, my coworkers all hated it too, though they gladly ate the other flavors i dismissed).<br /><br />For the reviewer who said it was too peppery, either they're extremely sensitive to black pepper, they got a badly mixed bag, or by chance grabbed a bit that was more peppery than the rest and didn't explore further. I think the pepper is perfect, strong enough to give it a little kick and sting, but light enough that it's not the primary (or even secondary) flavor. There is some variability, though, and once in a while you'll get a mouth full of pepper.<br /><br />While i gladly eat these for a snack at my desk at work, they are a must-have for long plane trips. The nuts make it filling, and the cranberries and glaze give it a nice sweet touch without being so sugary that i get the jitters trapped in a middle seat on hour 2 of a cross-country flight.",delicious.,5

"I love to bake and cook and feel homemade, from scratch, is almost always the way to go. Cookies, cakes etc, nothing can beat the loving touch of measuring the ingredients, right? Wrong! On a whim I picked up some Ghirardelli chocolate brownie mix at the store and haven't looked back since. Like all brownie mixes it's a box of powdered stuff to which is added oil, water, and egg.<br /><br />After that it's totally different from any box mix, or made at home brownie. The brownies have a delicious flavor, no fake or nasty taste. They are thick and dense and chocolate. Of course, being Ghirardelli I would expect the chocolate to be good, but these are great. I felt a little miffed to be honest and began making brownies left and right from some pretty famous chefs and gourmet cookbooks and finally, about the fifth time my family said, ""these are good, when are you going to make the Ghiardelli again?""

"The product arrived in USPS Priority Mail in good condition.  The product is fresh, as I've had concentrate that was sitting in a store shelf for a long time and the syrup has turned brown instead of the reddish hue.  Just in case you're wondering, this product was available locally in San Francisco Asian grocery stores and some Safeway supermarkets that have Asian cooking sections.  But I think the local distributor no longer stocks them as I cannot find them anywhere local for the last 2 years.<br /><br />The 600ml bottle is the smaller size of the two available sizes.  The one that I am used to the the 1000ml (1 liter) bottle which is slightly larger and is more common as the American size.  These turned out to be a smaller than I expected.<br /><br />The internal pull top opening is no longer circular but star shaped, allowing for a better flow stream without gurgling.  I mix this at a very diluted ratio of 10:1 of water:concentrate.<br /><br />I also recommend the IKEA ligonberry concentrate which comes in a 300ml glass bottle for $5 at the IKEA store.  It tastes close (a bit sweeter) but is of course a different fruit.  I'm glad I was able to find Ribena from Amazon as I have been craving this a long time now.  I still prefer the original blackcurrent flavor to the new lemon-blackcurrent or other fruit mix flavor blackcurrent concentrate.

"A friend told me about a delicious cereal that is not only low in calories, but full of fiber. I ordered Fiber One cereal about a month ago & not only do I eat a half-cup for breakfast (with fruit) every day, but I have another half-cup before bed. It helps me with weight loss, keeping me fuller, eating less calories. A terrific product. However, I originally paid $18.26 for SIX, 16.2 ounce boxes, with free shopping & handling. When I went on to increase my order, the price now listed is almost DOUBLE at almost $32. for the same 6 boxes. I tried for 30 minutes to write directly to Amazon, but couldn't find any area to do so. This was the best I could find. A good product but not at $32 dollars, after paying less than $19 for the same product & amount. Feedback? Are you reading this Amazon???",getting fiber the delicious way,5
Without a doubt this cannot be surpassed. I am always so conscientious about calorie count until I took a sip of this. I will just ration it for special moments. Even the cat's nose was twitching from the delightful scent. It is hard to believe that it was made in USA. If my daughter is lucky I might send her some at Christmas. It is a good thing I live alone or else I would have to hide it.,Best I ever tasted,5
We have really enjoyed these unusual snacks! We first got the variety mix and they were all pretty good but this mix is off the chart! No need to put these in a resealable bag they just don't get that far! I keep thinking how good they would be added to a meal as garnish or a salad. We truly love them! Thanks Guys!,Good Stuff!!!,5

"I love a good cream of wild rice soup.  I first tried Bear Creek's version because the grocer was out of my favorite canned version.

"Don't expect an oreo covered in chocolate--<br />This is a different cookie altogether. It consists of a thin chocolate wafer topped with a layer of creamy peanut butter. Then the whole cookie is covered in a layer of chocolate fudge.<br /><br />I enjoyed the cookie. Even though it was rich and delicious, the cookie itself seemed like a lighter snack than the typical heavy Oreo sandwich cookie. (Plus not as crumbly). It had the perfect combination of softness and crunch. The taste was similar to a peanut butter cup candy with an added crunch.<br />Next time I'll try the Mint Fudge Creme. It sounds divine!<br /><br />These are great for an indoor snack; however, I'd be cautious taking them to an outdoor picnic. I haven't tried it, but they may just turn into a melted mess!<br /><br />When I opened the box, a few of the cookies had shifted and broken in transit, but it was just a few in the middle row. Not enough to bother me, but just be aware of this when ordering online.",Peanut Butter Lovers--This Cookie is for You!,5

"For some reason, whenever I end up putting oil on my head, I think of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019GE8ZC"">Vitalis Hair Tonic For Men, 7 Ounce</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7MAW"">Brylcreem Hair Groom, Original, 5.5 fl oz (162 ml) (Pack of 3)</a>: grease everything down so not a hair on your head moves and you look like everybody else: neat but wet. Which is not to suggest that using this scalp treatment by Clear Scalp made me look or feel like a greaser or anything. In fact, the oil in this product feels pretty much like any other oil when I put it on my fingers, but when I rubbed it into my scalp, it dissipated quite aggressively. I even had to add a few drops more to cover my entire head after the first application got soaked into my skin and hair so easily. Clear Scalp didn't make my hair sticky and it didn't give it a very ""wet"" look. It just looks like I might have put some mousse or gel there and tousled my hair a bit. In other words, it seems greasy, but isn't. I have to say, too, that I'd actually been having a bit of dry scalp itchiness when I finally got around to trying this product, and it seems to have helped a lot. The itchiness has been reduced, I like the look of my hair, and this treatment is easy to use and reliably consistent. I was almost sure that any kind of hair or scalp oil would only rate two or three stars at the most, as this is 2012 and oily hair is for Lenny and Squiggy and Elvis impersonators, but this is a solid product. I'm confident in giving it a full five star rating, deservingly so.",Surprisingly good for a product reminiscent of the `50's,5

"Very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general. Just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like.  This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt. I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.",Very tasty,5

"I read an article last year about people in other countries who live to a great old age, without heart disease and cancer. One culture managed this, according to the article, by drinking as many as 5 cups of raw cocoa per day. I was interested in the possible health benefits, so after some research I discovered Navitas Cacao on Amazon and placed my order. We've been hooked ever since...Read the label.(BTW, this product has fiber in it. It took us a while to adjust our diets accordingly and for our bodies to adjust to the extra fiber.) We consume, on average, around 2 cups of hot cocoa each, per day.<br />I have priced it in health food stores and have yet to find such a good deal as Amazon offers.<br />As for the product, it really has changed our lives. We have never looked forward to a cup of anything as much as we look forward to a cup of hot cocoa made with this powder. (I know it contributed to me losing 30 pounds last year.) It is energizing,delicious and satisfying....and my husband loves it as much as I do! My favorite way to drink it is in a cup of hot (organic) milk with a tablespoon or two of (raw unprocessed) honey.  (You have to stir it extra well.) You can also bake with it, add it to coffee for a cafe mocha beverage, etc. AND it's low-calorie! If you love chocolate, this is the ultimate in pure chocolate bliss. Don't expect it to be sweet. This is dark; no sugar added.",Pure Cacao Powder by Navitas,5

"So, there must be some mommies out there like me who buy these bars for kids but won't eat them yourselves? You pop them in the lunch box together with the fruit in the bid to get them to stay off the junk food in school? Most of the time, these bars turn out to be a complete waste cos the kids will tell you that they are the worst thing ever. And you are wracked with guilt thinking you've scarred them for life. But then, you do it again anyway. And so, one day, I tried 1 of these bars and when I asked how it was - the answer surprised me. ""They're delicious, Mom. Really yummy"" I was stunned. A nut bar that passes the test. I'm so glad there's Amazon. I bought 2 packs - one fruit and nut and another variety pack. She loves all that she's tried so far.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I took a couple to the office. One day, in hunger, I finally opened one. And Oh. I. see. They're good. Really good. They're crunchy without being hard, a little sticky without being too sweet, a good mix of textures without them sticking to the space between your teeth. And at the end of the bar, you feel something in your tummy. Not full exactly but at least it does the job to stave off the hunger pangs.<br /><br />I'm now looking at other flavours to buy because this is going to be the Snack Of Choice 2012 for this household at least!",Surprisingly good,5

"Price:<br />For those who shop by Unit price like me for the real deal, this was the cheapest I can find this seasoning anywhere. Bj,s did not have this flavor. The container size is 24 ounce. The average size seasoning for the normal size in the supermarkets was 4 ounces. The 4 ounce size was $9.99. The unit prices are normally in pounds or LBS at the markets. Lets do the math. Here on Amazon for the 24 OZ size its $17.00 So the supermarket is selling this for $2.49 per oz or $39.84 per Lb. On amazon your paying $1.41 per oz or $22.56 per LB. What that means is your saving $1.08 per oz or $17.28 per lb in the UNIT price. Unit price is important. Its what you pay per cup, per quart per oz or pound, or per 100sheet of tissue and paper towel. Its how you determine what really is the deal. So that being said, store price is 176% more at the unit price level. So even if it was buy one get one free at the markets or half off, your still paying more than getting it from Amazon.<br /><br />Flavor:<br />This has a Texas style BBQ grilled flavor to it. That's the taste I love, and a use it to BBQ and for my seasoning with ribs and salmon. I love the taste. Go for it, Its a unique BBQ type seasoning. And the size it will last a long time in the house.",This was at least 88% cheaper per ounce,5

"I guess I'll review this. Bought one at the gas station, and personally, i love it. The inside has a cheesy-like texture, and it tastes quite spicy. Like all red meat, though, it's not good for you, so eat sparingly. I know meat eating is slowly declining, but here where I live, veganism is not seen. So ignore PETA's cries and take a bite out of this.",Since I can't think of anything else to write about...,5

"I love Nutiva hemp protein powder. I use it every morning in my green smoothies. It tastes better than most protein powders, but you may wish to add some mint, cacao powder, lime juice or other citrus to mask the green taste if you are not fond of it. It is very mind and pleasant to me, but it doesn't taste like the processed, flavored protein powders some may be used to. I usually have difficulty digesting protein powders, but I don't have any gas, bloating or tummy aches with this product.  The powder is smooth and blends very nicely with no lumps. It's not grainy and doesn't make me gag like many processed protein powders. I love that it's vegan, sustainable, and ethically produced. I subscribed to this product so I never run out. I keep a freezer bag of it in the freezer and a 32 oz mason jar of it in the fridge. It's dry so you don't have to defrost it or anything to use. You can also store at room temperature, but I prefer to keep mine cold. I also use nutiva coconut oil, cacao powder, and hemp seeds on a regular basis. They are all excellent products that I highly recommend.",I use it daily,5
"I do not like protein at all. Not protein bars, not protein in my shakes, I just don't like the taste. These bars taste great. I was hesistant to get them because I was afraid they would taste like the protein I hate. BUT, they are great. I like these better than the cereal bars.",great taste,5

"I first came across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea a number of years ago, while I was visiting a friend who lives out in Seaford, Long Island (NY). I was waiting for her to meet me in a mall, there, & I just happened into a Mideastern grocery-deli to browse and look at the great variety of exotic foods & spices they had for sale.<br /><br />By & by, I started getting thirsty & asked the shopkeeper whether he had cups of hot tea for sale. He showed me the varieties of tea they had & I chose Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, since Earl Grey has been my favorite ever since I was introduced to it back in the late '70s by an English friend of mine, who would prepare it with milk or cream & sugar or honey.<br /><br />Well, I had had excellent cups of Earl Grey tea in the past -- Twinings, Bigelow, Island-Rose & others -- but nothing I had previously tasted had fully prepared me for the sublimely fragrant, yet delicate & nuanced bouquet of aroma & flavor that literally ""took me by surprise"" upon my first sip of Ahmad Earl Grey Tea... aroma & flavor that was not just a simple one-dimensional taste but one that seemed to unfold as you drank it, revealing delightfully unexpected subtleties, layers & shades of enchantingly fragrant aromas & flavors.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the high quality of the tea leaves & the bergamot used to impart the flavor were clearly distinguishable to me in the tea's unmistakably delightful yet delicate aroma, not only when opening the box of 100 tea bags, or the individual envelopes containing the bags of tea... but quite detectable, in the tea bag itself, even after having made a cup of tea or two, making me wonder whether they might have discovered some very effective, secret manner of infusing the bergamot aroma into the tea leaves, or the tea bag, such that the aroma didn't dissipate after having made a cup of tea, or even while standing on the shelf of the grocery, as I've noticed sometimes happens with lesser grades of Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />In any event, after such an incomparable experience with Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, it is the only Earl Grey tea that I choose to drink, unless I happen to be out somewhere where it is, unfortunately, not available.<br /><br />It is at such times that I am so appreciative to have come across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea.<br /><br />Though I often purchase it at Mideastern food markets, for instance in Astoria, Queens, where it is readily available at rock-bottom prices & fresh from the importers, nevertheless, for those of you who are too far away to do so, the fact that it is available here on Amazon.com is already quite a boon, especially if you order a number of packages of it to lessen the impact of the shipping charges.<br /><br />If you do order Ahmad Earl Grey Tea & try it, I'm quite sure that you'll find that it soon becomes for you, as it has for me, ""a most exquisite delight, definitely not to be missed!""","Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, 100TB ~ The Most Exquisite Earl Grey I've Ever Tasted",5
"I'd never tried flavored, roasted seaweed snacks before (however, do love seaweed and make our own sushi) but ordered both the Sesame and Wasabi due to low price and good reviews. Loved them! Love the Wasabi due to the Wasabi flavor/spiciness. The spiciness definitely adds up as you are eating them and will clear your sinuses after awhile but I think it's great! Love the Sesame due to the saltier flavor. I acknowledge I may be odd for that but I've always been a salt fan and these are so much better than chips! Only one of my co-workers was a fan but my BF loves them as well as one of his co-workers. Just ordered another case of each for us and his co-worker.",Amazingly good!,5

"Having dairy-free beverages available when I travel has been a huge problem, until Better Than Milk-Vanilla rice powder.

With the tight lid on the bottle, I can add water to the powder and shake vigorously to mix fully. No spills. It's great on cereal & in coffee; doesn't dissolve quite well enough to drink separately.<br />  Another discovery: mix it at double-strength to create a delicious foamy addition to a cup of coffee.

WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf.

"I am incredibly picky when it comes to chocolate, and most chocolate mixes are simply sugar with a few specks of chocolate.  Bellagio sipping chocolate is by far the BEST chocolate mix I have ever tried...and I've tried many!  It is a little more expensive than other brands of cocoa mix, but you definitely get what you pay for.  A little goes a long way, and you can make anything from hot cocoa to thick sipping chocolate to ""spoon"" chocolate to chocolate mousse....the list goes on and on.  I even made a great ""chocolate emergency"" frosting by simply mixing some of the chocolate in with a bowl of whipped cream.  And as an added bonus, the tin the chocolate comes in is super cute and makes a wonderful gift.",Absolutely the best sipping chocolate!,5

"For a variety of reasons, I wanted to stop consuming sugary beverages such as soda and juice.  Many zero calorie beverages have artificial sweeteners, which I feel are generally unhealthy, potentially carcinogenic, and also not very tasty.  However, I'm not a big fan of plain water as I just really don't like the taste.  Talking rain sparkling water is a fabulous alternative.  It's extremely tasty, contains no sugar, has no unpronounceable ingredients, and is very affordable.  Basically, the lemon-lime flavor is subtle, and combined with the fizzy-ness, results in a very pleasant beverage.  The price for these bottles is, per unit volume, comparable to what 2L bottles are sold at in my local grocery store.<br /><br />The only drawback is that all these small bottles are not a very environmentally friendly option.  Hopefully Amazon will start selling the 2L bottles in bulk at some point.",Fabulous alternative to sugary beverages,5

"I first tasted Swiss Familia Muesli in 1964 as a kid. I grew up on that cereal and really loved it. I had no idea that Familia made other cereals until I started shopping on Amazon. Then, after buying the Swisss Familia Muesli exclusively from Amazon for quite some time, one day they ran out of stock.<br /><br />Rather than go to my local health food store I noticed that they had the Familia Swiss Crunch with berries showing up in ""other products available."" I read the rave reviews and decided to try a 6-pack. The cereal arrived and both my wife and I have been hooked since.<br /><br />Unlike the Muesli, this cereal has a crunchy texture that stays crunchy in the bowl. The included berries offer a tasty accent. We usually add blueberries and sliced bananas to the bowl to make it extra special but that's a bonus. The cereal is delicious with or without added fruit because it comes with dried berries. It has a nutty flavor and crunchy texture that is unlike any cereal I've tried to date. I'm so hooked on the Swiss Crunch I really have no interest in any other cereal.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Definitely a must try. And Amazon is the best place to buy it. Bon appetit.",Excellent!

"So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.

Hot water, dump it in, and mmmm.... and I normally HATE any instant coffee.  This is unlike any instant I've tried, and really does taste as good as Starbucks in the store.

I noticed immediately she is less hairy, and her fur is softer, and she is much more happier. My girl never complains about much with one exeception she will not eat chicken, beef, just fish, fish, fish. And I rather keep it that way, that's what cats should eat.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with it!  The only ""complaint"" I would have is that the packaging is a little, mmm.

"Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.",For more than salting foods.,5

"The 5 star review is totally accurate. This is an expensive food, for some that might be an issue. But if you can work out the cost factor, all I can say is my dog loves this and he no longer bites his paws. We had huge issues with his paw biting for a long time, even when we had him on California natural. It seemed like nothing we did worked, until we switched to Acana. He's happy now, and he is super excited to get his food. And I mean like way too excited, he will quickly pace back and forth and whine until he gets it.",Terrific dog food,5

"These are the best rawhides I've ever used. I became concerned about the quality of rawhides after reading an online article and wondering what was actually in these treats I was giving my dog every night. To spare you the details on the article, I tracked down Wholesome Hides as a company where the rawhides were made in the US and not chemically treated. The added bonus was that these rawhides are incredibly thick and this version of their retriever roll has about 6 layers of rawhide coiled around each other. On a normal night, my beagles consume a whole rawhide. They worked on the super thick retriever roll over over a week. So I think the extra cost of these is negated by the fact that it takes my dogs so long to get through them. Be careful when you order. I ordered another retriever roll from someone else on Amazon that did not have the ""super thick"" designation. It still lasted longer than the grocery store-bought rawhides, but not as long as this one.",Great!!!,5

"This is fabulous. Heard about it on Sean Hannity and wanted to try it. My wife bought it for me as an early Christmas present. The set up and operation is super simple. To me the taste is excellent because it is so fresh. I like Polar sodas and those work out to about $.98 a liter. This does $.67 a liter. The diet cola does not have the classic metal taste and no aspartame. If you love diet soda you will love this. If you don't, you will leave a poor review. I thought it would taste like a cheap store brand diet cola, and it is so much better than that. It reminded me of Coke Classic.",Fabulous,5

"I don't usually buy these kinds of things, but couldn't pass it up when it was on sale a while back. These tasty, healthy treats are perfect for on the go! I snack on them while I am at school. Some fruits have more flavor than others. Raspberries are probably my favorite. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them. My only complaint is the price is a little pricey. My girlfriend however doesn't like the tastey treat. May not be for everyone. Taste testing them somewhere could be advised, although I am not sure where you could test them out.",Mmmmmm Yummy...,5

Starbucks tested this coffee in 2 markets almost 2 years ago. I fell in love. I now carry it in my purse and my luggage at all times.(some hotels have the worst coffee) I also put a pack in my Earthquake/disaster bag. A good cup of coffee always helps in any situation and this is GREAT coffee. The taste is always just like a fresh brewed cup!,Love this Columbian!,5

"It is hard to describe what these bars actually are.  First I am always on the look out for a candy bar that has nuts, no chocolate and is not sickeningly sweet.  TA DA!  Enter the KIND BAR company.  These work as  candy bars.  YUMMY.  These work as a nice under 200 calorie snack to tide you over in between meals.  These definitely are nutrition bars.

"I hope these come in stock, and soon!  I'm a Seventh-day Adventist (a lot of us are vegetarians and know good veggie stuff) and would normally get Super-Links from the Potomac Adventist Book and Health Food Store in Silver Spring, Maryland.  However, they're not that close so the nearest option is Safeway but they're almost $9.00 for a single can...rather outrageous.<br /><br />I didn't grow up vegetarian but if I had a supply of these I would never miss the real thing.  They're good right out of the can (heated quickly) and into a hot dog bun.  Most of all, I love chopping a few into small rounds and cooking with sauteed onions, stewed tomatoes, sweet corn, and little bit of sugar (to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes).  Delicious over rice!  Enjoy!",Absolutely delicious!  Great taste and texture...,5

"Kikkoman's Sushi and Sashimi soy sauce is a slightly lighter, slightly sweeter variant on their great basic product.  It is excellent for dipping sushi when plain soy sauce might flavor the rice too strongly.  With sashimi, it's slightly sweet texture nicely compliments delicate fish, and is a superb counterpoint to wasabi.  All in all, I highly recommend this product.",Another Kikkoman Winner,5
"Let me begin by saying that I REALLY like coffee.  And I strongly favor the darkest, boldest flavors.  I'm generally not a big fan of flavored coffees.  Most of them use the flavors to hide the fact that the coffee itself is not that great.  Imagine my shock when I found the opposite to be true of this coffee.  Even without the coconut flavor, this would be a rich, delicious coffee.  And the coconut flavor just serves to enhance what is already a tasty brew.  Quite simply, this is by far the most delicious flavored coffee I have ever tasted.  But do yourself a favor...try it yourself, and take a few moments just to inhale the aroma.  From the first tantalizing scent to the last sip, this coffee is a great  experience.  By the way...I just ordered some more of it!",Surprisingly Delicious,5

However, these a absolutely wonderful when dipped in a cup of warm chai.  I have one now with my tea almost every morning.  Yes, they are expensive here, but they are far more reasonable on Amazon than anywhere else on the internet, including Cascadian Farm's website.

"I do not get the calm relaxing better sleeping side effects from this. What I do get though is something that keeps my bowels regular. I take a medicine that causes heavy constipation, some users resort to taking laxatives every day which is addictive and dangerous. This is the best thing to clear you out and move things along. I've had two children and they send you home with a stool softener (Collace for me) and this works far better than collace. I started out about a week on just one large teaspoon. I was very bloated and backed up the entire time, it wasn't really doing much, then I upped to two large teaspons, without being graphic, it completely fixed my problem, although there were a few times if I hadn't been very close to a bathroom it could have resulted in a very traumatizing event. I don't think it tastes bad at all, I enjoy the warm drink in the evening, I put honey in mine, and use the natural one.",GREAT STOOL SOFTENER!,5

It makes a great green tea latte.",Very good for green tea latte!!,5

My two cats love this food!  I normally buy the chicken and the beef/chicken formulas and have been using it ~ 2 yrs now.  High quality ingredients with no corn or preservatives are a priority for me since my cats previously had issues with allergies and dander.  My cats no longer have dry skin and now only have some seasonal allergies instead of year round problems.<br /><br />The negative is that Wellness food is expensive.  I'm always on the lookout for coupons and I buy larger quantities in wet and dry food to save.  I only give my cats wet food once a day and use a feeder with a timer to ration out dry food for the rest of the day.,High Quality Food,5

"If you start reading cat food labels you will discover few that have the quality of ingredients that this one does.  Well, actually you will discover some - probably in a nice pet food store - but good luck getting your cat to eat it!<br /><br />One of my cats used to be pre-diabetic, asthmatic, and overweight.  At that time his diet was exclusively Iams.  My vet, who has done much research on various foods, has a list of cat food she recommends.  Of all the expensive and exclusive brands of food, the Fancy Feast Turkey & Giblets Feast and the Gourmet Chicken Feast really made a difference, and my other more finicky eaters loved it!  The 'problem cat' is no longer asthmatic, has lost weight, and is not pre-diabetic.  Plus, everyone who sees him can't get over what a fantastic shiny coat he has.  Now I buy these two flavors exclusively.  I highly recommend this product.",Great product that cats actually love!,5

The stock has lots of flavor so not much more is needed.  However, he likes it spicy so we add sriracha and a bit of Thai fish sauce.  The stock is convenient, tasty, and easy to store.

"I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.",Great Sweetener but learn about the product,5
"Love this coffee! This has got to be the best deal on coffee in the United States. Packages arrived well packed, and sealed.

"I know the front label says this food is for senior cats but my sphynx kitten is very active and this is also for active cats, so I figured I'd give it a try. I made a mixture of half Newman's Own Advanced with half of Kitten Chow (for the required kitten essentials!) and my kitty loves it. I like how this is organic and the nibbles are nice and hard to promote healthy teeth. I've also noticed my kitty's poop isn't stinky anymore because this food is of much better quality than the other so-called premium cat foods I've tried before. Tip: If you're feeding your cat a dry food mix and its poop stinks it usually indicates its poor quality - so upgrade. I'm going to continue feeding my kitty the mixture and once he's an adult I may switch over to feeding him just this exclusively.",My Kitty Loves This Food,5
"There are lots of ""hot sauces"" that just go for being the hottest. But unlike something that is basically pepper extract for the sake of being hot, this stuff actually tastes good. And make no mistake...it's HOT. Very hot.<br /><br />For the average person who doesn't eat a lot of spicy/hot food, 2 drops in a large bowl of chili will have them running for something to drink. For those of us who enjoy the spicier side of cuisine, 5+ drops in a bowl of chili is pure watery-eyes goodness.<br /><br />I have also used this in stir-fry, soups, Chinese food, flavored rice, pot roasts...you name it. I definitely recommend this if you want something to really spice up your food and yet add some flavor instead of just insane hotness for the sake of it.",Like It Hot?,5
"I am very gluten sensitive and have unconsciously avoided pasta for years, as well as bread, pizza, etc.  I've become consciously aware of this sensitivity and have switched to gluten-free foods as much as possible.<br /><br />When I saw this pasta, I thought, hmmm.  Great price for gluten-free pasta although I wasn't sure about the size/shape of this pasta since I do prefer larger flat pasta noodles.<br /><br />When I cooked this pasta, I was very pleasantly surprised. It cooked quickly, stayed firm enough for me, and digested like a charm. No bloated feeling after eating it..........it went down like a vegetable and I love the size.<br /><br />It's perfect to add to soup for a bit more ""body"".  I also made a delicious stove-top tuna casserole-type meal by combining about a cup of this uncooked pasta, then cooking it, a can of tuna drained, some cooked broccoli and diced baby carrots, garlic to taste, and then heated it all together with half a jar of alfredo sauce.  Yum and quick.......probably 15 minutes start to finish.<br /><br />The price at about a buck plus a bag is amazing compared to the prices you'll find in your local health food store and it's not a compromise, in my opinion.<br /><br />If you have digestion issues or gluten sensitivity, please consider trying this product.  It's a winner !",Excellent Pasta !,5

I like espresso straight and this is close to that.  So you get a good caffeine kick without a load of milk and sugar.  I have a few cases of these and have one some mornings on the way to work.

I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well.

"I am a first time mom, and our child had A LOT Of difficulties with solid foods and had an overactive gag reflex.  This food (and we do buy these in the set of 8)was and continues to be a lifesaver.  When nothing else would do, our baby LOVED these. I will say that they are on the expensive side compared to what you can get in the grocery stores and ""big-baby-chain"" stores.  We compared these to the GERBER yougurt melts and I believe there to be a noticible difference in quality/ taste, with these coming out on top. In the begining when she was just starting solids she would eat bunches of these on her own. They melt very quickly and for us, there was never a concern for choking (or puking with the overactive gag reflex).  Our baby is older now and can eat a lot more table foods, but we still mix these in with other puffs, cherrios, and small cereals for her to eat as a mix.<br /><br />I have purchased three orders of these from amazon (and enjoy amazon prime shipping)- so will likely purchase again, would recommend to a friend, and would buy (in smaller portions) as a gift for other moms to try out.",A Little Scary How Much The Kid Loves These,5

"I originally bought this for my husband who loves spicy foods. We had an amazing dinner party at the house where I mixed sauce in the white rice with some grilled Kebabs, this small addition made the food so authentic.

It was so amazing and really made loosing weight so easy. I started to utilize this spice and it eliminated my cravings. I sauteed carrots then mixed some in, even used it as a dipping sauce for a eggplant that ended tasting like a gourmet infused far eastern salad...This sauce has really saved me from cheating on my diet.

And at four bucks a pop when you buy six GoPics, this is a perfect alternative to crappy airline food, or crappy school lunches, or just prepackaged generally crappy food.<br /><br />If you like to eat well but sometimes have to suddenly go somewhere without time to make something good to take, and you know that fast food scams like gmo-filled fake-""healthy"" places such as Chubway are just selling you processed junk, then these GoPicnic meals will save you lots of time and money and give you better food as well. Win/win/win.<br /><br />We keep a few tucked away in the cupboard and they've already saved us from eating worse and spending more a number of times.<br /><br />This is a fine prodcut, of which I think we'll soon see more, from many of the agri-biz idiots.<br />If you can't buy local and organic, this is a good stopgap in the meantime.",Very decent for four bucks,5

"I have been eating nothing but Kashi Golean for breakfast for the past 4 or 5 years (OK, with the occasional splurge at IHOP or similar). Its nutritional values are perfect: high fiber, high protein, will keep you going for a long time. I add some Splenda and cinnamon for sweetness, skim milk, and some dried fruit (cranberries, etc). I love the taste, and I love the calorie count. For people who love cereals, but can't afford the ridiculous amount of added sugar in most commercial cereals, Kashi is the best.","As far as I am concerned, this is the best",5

"With 5 effective ""net carbs"" (take carbs subtract fiber content= net carbs), this pasta is the poster child of the diabetic eating clinic. How does it taste? I donated all my other pastas and stocked up on this stuff! It's delicious! It doesn't require much to make you feel full. Add a tomato with some pasta sauce, yum! Remember to weigh or measure your portions as you don't need a lot of this to make you full!<br />If you are diabetic and really want a delicious pasta, buy this, don't delay, you won't be disappointed. I gave it to my family and nobody knows I've changed a thing. They never liked the high fiber pasta's either (the pastas were gritty and brown).

"I am a trainer at a local no-kill shelter.  I work with all different types and temperaments of dog, and the only common denominator is that I need their undivided attention and a reward they'll do almost anything for.  Plus, being a wide population, I needed something with a simple ingredient list (so as to avoid digestive issues).  THIS IS THE TREAT!  I am a huge fan of Zuke's already, but was dubious as to whether or not one type of treat would suit the tastes of so many different dogs.  The chicken flavor has yet to fail me.<br /><br />Low-calorie, a universally appealing flavor and the perfect training size.  Bonus for trainers: they don't smell half bad!  However, their scent is still strong enough to work as a puzzle toy filler, a Kong filling, for tracking or scent games or to just grab focus from an enticing squirrel. ;)<br /><br />Even previously feral and non-treat-motivated dogs seem quite happy that I bring these.  Highly recommend.",Little doggie attention magnets!,5
"I have bought several types of bread mix for my breadmaker.  My family likes this type of bread mix ""head & shoulders"" above all others.  I like each different type, but this one is the best.  Hodgson Mills deliver exceptional quality.  Never had a problem with any box, every one created a great loaf of bread.  And the price from Amazon is GREAT.

"Awsome. I first started eating these snacks when I found the LAST bag of the Valdosta Pecan variety. I thought they were awsome, but I could never find them at Costco again. I have been trying out a few of Amazons subscriptions and it hit me that maybe I should search them up. Of course they were available and I got a subscription to the Valdosta Pecan. Then I found these gift packs on sale for LESS THAN MY SUBSCRIPTION! YES! And it's a variety pack, which makes it even MORE AWSOME!

I'd rank Toffifay as tied with Ferrero Rocher for the greatest chocolate candy ever. Sadly Toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live.

"My spouse is gluten-free and we'd tried Kinnikinnick (try saying that 5 times fast!) bread crumbs for chicken in the past, when they were sold in a plain white plastic bag, and been very satisfied with it, and were dismayed when it became no longer available. We happened to be shopping at our local health food store when I spotted this product and bought it immediately over an alternative GF product based on the Kinnikinnick name and our past experience. We followed the directions as shown on the box: dredge in sweet rice flour (aka mochiko, very cheap at any asian grocery store), then dip in egg wash, and finally in the bread crumbs. Bake for 40 minutes at 375 and yum! Very crispy coating, and as another reviewer said, you'd never guess it was GF. The only thing I would have done differently, as other reviewers have also said, is to add some seasonings for taste -- out of the box it's good, but a tad bland. To be fair, the box does suggest using your own seasonings or parmesan cheese.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a good GF breadcrumb for chicken or other meats, you need look no further. It does contain egg, so those with egg allergies need to avoid it, but it's GFCF so perfect for us. Highly recommended.",Great GF product for fried chicken,5

"Beet sugar is this product's sweetener. My body handles beet sugar OR cane sugar better then High-Fructose-Corn-Syrup without brain fog and craving for more sweets. Even though a calorie is a calorie, how each body handles the calorie's source is equally important. Most artificial sweeteners trigger my headaches, so ZERO calorie products aren't my friend either. This product is a good alternative to diet or regular sodas for me. I'm not a purist or a foodie, just a person who's balancing good health and good taste day-by-day.<br /><br />The product reviews + good sale price convinced me to try these. I'm glad I did, they're my go-to guilty pleasure. Tasty, easy, flexible and a healthier choice than soda for me. I purchased both the Passion Orange Guava and Strawberry Sensation.

"Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day.",Good deal on a great item!,5

"I love Dr. McDugall's orginal organic instant oatmeal (discovered it as a backpacking food) that I end up having a pack or two each work day morning as breakfast.  Since I don't want to get tired of it, I have been looking for alternative hot breakfast and ended up finding this one.<br /><br />I had grits for only once in my life time therefore I did not know what to expect.  Granted, this product takes more prep time than instant oatmeal.  After a bit branstorming I found a quicker/no fuss way to fit it into my morning routine.<br /><br />The night before I'd put 1/4 cup of it in a bowl and a cup of water, add a bit of salt or chicken stock (powder form), stir and then cover the bowl with a plate.  Let it soak over night.<br /><br />In the morning while getting ready for work, I put the bowl with cover in the microwave to zap it for 3 minutes.  When zapping is done, stir a bit and let it sit.  By the time I am ready to eat it, it'd almost be perfectly soft, gooey, and not too hot.<br /><br />I prefer eating it with dried pork (pork sung) and diced pickled turnips.

"I ran into this at my local Whole Foods for $6.99(MSRP regular price) and thought I love garlic I'll give this a try.  Fermenting cabbage turns a lack luster vegetable into a nutritious powerhouse superfood of Sauerkraut so starting out with a superfood such as garlic has got to end up with a super superfood!  right!  I made some homemade onion soup and threw a couple of black garlic in there and let me tell you is tastes super delicious!  I may have found it for the nutrition but I am going to buy again and again for the delicious flavor!

"We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.","The ENERGY drink is the only one I can tolerate, and I love that one!",5
"I am not normally a fan of mint teas.  They usually smell great, but are very weak tasting, no matter how much you steep.  This is the first mint tea I have ever come across that has a black and green tea base, instead of just a green tea base.  What a difference!  The Assam really kicks the tea up a notch without overpowering the mint at all.  It has a lovely aroma, and a nice strong flavor.  I can't say whether I felt ""revitalized"" or ""invigorated"" but it tasted great and that's the most important thing.  It has such a great flavor, I tried it as an iced tea and found it was fantastic.  Very refreshing!<br /><br />Since this is marketed as ""health tea,"" I have not been able to find any Yogi flavors in a regular grocery store.  It is available in vitamin shops (online and brick and mortar), and similar outlets.  Though it is a trifle expensive compared to regular tea at almost $4, I would definitely buy it again.  Since it takes several bags to make a pitcher of iced tea, it is worth it to subscribe for me, which also brings the price down.

"When I was a little girl my grandmother would go to visit her mom in Germany. The best thing I can recall about it was when she would come back with these lovely little blue square chocolate bars that I thought were amazing. I still do. Eventually we could buy them at a specialty store here in my hometown, and now I can buy them at Target (thank you, God) when they're in stock (which is hardly ever, for the milk chocolate).<br /><br />To say that this chocolate is the best I've ever tasted is a complete understatement. All those years ago I had no idea, really, because we got them so rarely - plane tickets to Germany not falling of trees, you see. I didn't realize exactly how much of a delicacy it was until I was able to get it regularly and believe you me, there is no comparison. Hershey's? Not anymore. Reese's PB cups? Only if I'm craving. Dove? Oh hell no. Godiva? ...Sometimes, lol.<br /><br />Ritter Sport? There is no comparison. It really is the perfect chocolate. Smooth, creamy, melting just so on the tongue. Not a trace of bitter, not overly sweet, an exquisite balance of flavor no matter what part of the tongue it hits. I would recommend this chocolate to anyone, anywhere. There is none better.",Best chocolate I've ever tasted.,5

"My daughter-in-law, Tyra, and I were recently at Lincoln City on the Oregon Coast, and were checking out of a store when I spied the Tillamook Pepperoni sticks.  I bought a couple for both of us and we couldn't stop talking about how good they were!  I decided then and there that I would search out the container with these tasty pepperoni sticks.  And, lo and behold!  I found the exact kind here on Amazon, AND I got the last pack of 24.  Waiting now for a new shipment.  Was planning to hold out and give the entire box to my daughter-in-law for Christmas, but I couldn't resist.  So, now I'm waiting for more to show up here. And, just so you know...there is a big difference in these that come in the container, and those that are individually wrapped in the plastic that pulls open from the top.  These are more on the dry side and not moist with some kind of something or other that inside the plastic.  Not nearly as good, but also from Tillamook.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat these salty, spicy, savory sticks is with an apple.  Juicy, sweet Fuji apple and bites of this pepperoni.

"*****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. The flavor is enhanced by ""the all natural flavor of bergamot orange"", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",An Earl Grey Tea for Earl Grey Tea Lovers!,5

It has that nice Grapefruit sweetness and smell and delicate yet reach taste. I had other Dragon Wells from different tea shops but this one tastes and smell best in my opinion (so far at least). Adagio's was good but more expensive and not organic and Mighty Leaf's Dragon Well was average at best. The price is also great and when you subscribe it's even better. Highly recommended. Also steeping timing and water temperature is critical with this type of tea (never go more than 3 minutes and more than 180 F). Nevertheless it seems more forgiving that some other ""higher end"" greens.",Great Dragon Well,5

"I purchased these little gems last week on a whim, after researching the history of the Abbaye de Flavigny. They have been making these candies since the year 1591! Anise is an acquired taste, I think, akin to a delicate licorice, and those who enjoy it will absolutely love these anise drops. A fact I found quite interesting is that it takes fifteen days to make just one of these candies!<br /><br />Each candy is roughly the size of a medium pearl, with a pleasantly smooth texture. They are not meant to be chewed, (the word ""jaw-breaker"" comes to mind!) but savored. The taste is exquisite: strong but not overpowering, herbal and sweet. At the heart of each drop is an anise seed, the texture of which contrasts beautifully with the hardness of the candy surrounding it. Very refreshing.<br /><br />I am so glad that I stumbled upon these! They are a real treasure in a world where artificial flavorings and chemical-based sweeteners are the norm. There is something quite special about these Anise Drops from Abbaye de Flavigny.<br /><br />As for the seller, Touch of Europe, I couldn't be happier with their service. My package arrived quickly, (two days before the estimated arrival time!) wrapped safely, and included a hand-signed letter thanking me for my business, which I thought was a nice touch.",Very pleased!,5

However, it is a little weak and does not give the full bodied tea experience of true Indian chai. So I mix strong black tea from India. Then boil some ginger before adding the tea in the water. Also, milk should always be added after the tea has boiled for a minute or so. When it all comes to the boil for the last time, add sugar/honey and strain.

"The dispenser is adorable and looks great;  however the dispenser MUST have a coin.  It is advertised as with or without coin but that is incorrect.  On the box it even states a coin must be used.  So when I gave as a gift, I included a jar of pennies.  Works fine.",Dispenser not as advertised.,5
"My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want a healthy pet, you should do a combination of dry and wet food.<br /><br />The critics have unrealistic nutritional expectations if they are only feeding their animal dry food.",Excellent cat food,5
"I work as a security guard at a hospital here in town, and I hate eating in the cafeteria upstairs because everything is overpriced! I bring this meal with me sometimes, along with a chicken breast patty that I cut up in pieces and mix in with this Maruchan Yakisoba cooked meal. It's great! Thank God we have a microwave and fridge in the office! I can eat so much cheaper, and cheap never tasted so good!!",Great for taking to work!,5
"My dog loves these. One lasts her about a week. i put one in her crate while im at work and she nibbles at it. its funny because my cats like them too, i found them stealing them from my pom and licking them. i will be buying these again.",My dog likes these.... and cats? ha!,5
"we moved to NY where we could not find fresh Goat's milk., so we ordered the canned milk to see how it would be. After trying it, I will now never return to the fresh. No need to. This is wonderful.

"I grew up eating homemade stuffed grape leaves.  Of the canned varieties, I have tried Galil, Roland and Sultan.  Roland is rather bland and the leaves are tough, with the veins being too large, I.E. they were allowed to grow for too long and are no longer tender.  Sultan had good flavor but far too much oil, which also affected the texture.  The Galil are the best tasting by flavor and texture and they are also reasonably priced.  The first Galil I bought (case of 12 cans of 14 oz each) were twenty-seven dollars and forty-six cents after the subscription discount in February 2011.  I will type out the money in words, in hopes of escaping the Amazon censors.",Galil is the best canned stuffed grape leaves I have tried so far,5

"I got these since they were on sale, I love ramen especially nong shim, but I thought I would give Maruchan a try. Surprisingly, I really liked this ramen. It has a creamy taste, mixed with chicken broth. It reminds me of creamy pasta but not overly creamy, I should say just right creamy taste. If you are looking for NONspicy, ""americanized"" ramen, this is it. Give it a try. But, please do NOT add 2 cups of water as it says in the bag, I add 1 cup to 1.25 cup of water instead and it tastes much better.",Pretty GOOD!,5

"This brand of kuding tea is excellent. It is very bitter but yet within a very short time you feel relief. Less bloated, lighter and generally more alert. I am very happy with this product. I usually use two or three sticks in a very large mug, leave it to cold a little and remove leave just before drinking. The leaves are good for use 2 extra time. I kept them in the fridge between uses.",excellent tea,5
I heard about these originally on a Doctor's show.  They are very satisfying without having to eat very many and have relatively little calories.  A deep chocolate taste at a price better than most.  I highly recommend.,These are so Good!,5
I subscribe to shipments so I was able to get this for $28 for a 12 pack and it is well worth every penny!  It saves you from buying it at the store (average $4-$5 per can) and it definitely gives me energy to get through the day without the unnecessary stuff that other energy drinks have.  I love Red Bull!,Great Product!,5
I put Cayenne pepper on bird seed to keep squirrels away from the feeders.  (Use a mask and gloves to sprinkle the Cayenne over the seeds and mix well; add to feeder.)  The birds have different  glands than  mammals (squirrels are mammals!).  The birds are NOT affected by the hot at all; they don't taste it.  Main problem is that when it rains some of the cayenne is washed off and then you'll see a squirrel occasionally until you refill the feeder .... but this has sure saved on my sunflower seed expenditures!!  I only use about a tablespoon or so to a feeder-full of seed.,SCAT Squirrels !!!,5

"This is organic, product of the US, and has no preservatives. Just corn. That means healthy. Yes, this is a little bit expensive, but better than eating junk foods. The texture is not hard. I love this.",This is healty and yummy snack.,5
"I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation.",I loved them!,5
"Best canned vegetarian chili I've found. Hearty, thick, just the right amount of spices, with bits of textured vegetable protein. Good by itself or in a burrito, or with veggie hot dogs. Next best thing to making my own. Even a non-vegetarian would love this.",Favorite canned chili,5
"A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed ""Bircherm&uuml;esli"" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.<br /><br />If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- ""Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss"" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br /><br />- ""The ABS Diet"", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br /><br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br /><br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br /><br />- ""Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot"", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.",An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet,5
"Ritter Sport Milk CHocolate bar is a basic milk chocolate candy bar. It comes in a rather thick brick divided into 16 squares. These are large candy bars, the nutrition information says it's about 3 servings, a child or small person would probably be happy with 4 squares (1/4 of the bar). Personally, I eat the whole thing, If I bought these by the dozen, I would not be small.<br /><br />THe chocolate itself is wonderful, smooth and creamy. It has about 30% cocoa content. If you prefer dark chocolate, Ritter Sport's dark chocolate candy is wonderful too.<br /><br />Last week, we ran out of chocolate chips and wanted cookies, so we all coughed up our squirreled away ritter sport bars and broke them into bits.

"When it comes to Chai tea, this Celestial Seasonings Chai Decaf Tea, Sweet Coconut Thai is my favorite. I really love the Indian and Thai fusion of flavors in this tea. A perfect combination I must say. I like the coconut taste in this tea, and when it comes to Thai-inspired at-home teas, this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Chai definitely tastes better than Yogi Tea's Sweet Thai Delight tea. It's also a bonus that this tea is decaffeinated, and as the other Amazon reviewers have said, this tea is definitely perfect for relaxation and before going to bed. If you like Thai-inspired teas such as this, I also suggest trying Harney and Sons' Bangkok Green Tea with Thai Flavors. It's an excellent, delicious fine tea with coconut, vanilla, ginger, and lemongrass. I also highly recommend The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's Thai-picked Lemon Chamomile, Blueberry Peach Green Tea, and Spring Peach Oolong Teas. Another tea with some Thai influence is the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' Organic Berry Berry Caffeine-Free tea. For cold Thai teas, I highly recommend Taste Nirvana's Real Thai Tea Latte and Real Green Tea Latte. My parents were born and raised in Thailand, and thus I'm Thai American. If you actually visit Thailand, which I have multiple times since the majority of my relatives live there, then I highly recommend trying Thai Chrysanthemum tea. I had the best tea I've ever had in my entire life in Thailand. And that's saying something because I've actually traveled up (sometimes my small traveling party and I had to walk a long and grueling hike for intervals of 30 minutes to a whole hour. Even actor Blair Underwood made a comment how he was amazed that even elderly Chinese women could climb up these mountains for long periods of time, and claimed they were in better shape than him! That's how I felt as well. If you visit China, you will see that a lot of Chinese are very physically fit - they walk, hike, bike a lot and do all sorts of exercises such as swimming and Tai Chi and fan exercises in their parks) the tea-growing terraced mountains in and around the Guilin region of China and tasted tea from those Chinese regions and also tasted some tea when I traveled to Japan, but those Asian teas don't compare to the Chrysanthemum tea I had many years back in northern Thailand. (I haven't traveled to England and India yet, but would love to. I bet the teas there are amazing. But like I said, from all the countries I've traveled to so far - Thailand has the best teas, cold and hot.) When I think about it, I was very young then, and I should have asked the Thai waitress where they got their tea from. All I know is that I drank that tea at a restaurant at a Thai hotel resort many years back in Northern Thailand not far from Chiang Rai and the Golden Triangle region. Anyways, I have given boxes of this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Thai Chai Decaf Tea as small gifts to friends in the past few years. The fact that you can order this in packs of six at an affordable price is great, and allows you the luxury to share some of this tea with friends and family. My verdict is that this is a nice aromatic, delicious tea to unwind for the day.",My Favorite Chai,5

"This bar is a very nice snack! The bar is not hard or dry like most granola bars, but is not too soft either. This is a very delightful & chewy granola bar that has a nice size to it!<br /><br />The bar itself looks to be composed mostly of nuts. I first expected something closer to a payday candy bar for flavor, but that changed when I ate one of these Planters Big Triple Nut bars. These bars are not simply just a bunch of peanuts, or plain old granola bars. It is a wonderful blend of both with a nice honey flavor.<br /><br />I enjoyed these bars and find them to be a useful snack when I am a little hungry, but don't have time to eat yet. A much better alternative to a sugar filled candy bar. Also, they are excellently priced! Each 8.1 Ounce box has 5 bars, each weighing in at 1.6 oz ... so, you get 50 bars!

"I just had a heart bypass and my doctor recommended a diet high in protein to help build muscle mass after the surgery.  I had never tried a supplement other than a multi-vitamin.  I try to eat organic so I was told by a nurse that there was an organic protein drink on the market.  I did some research and found that ORGAIN met my requirements.  I've been drinking it for about two months now, at least one a day.  Not only do they taste good, but they have helped me gain back a lot of the muscle mass that I lost during my hospital stay (almost two weeks).  The only draw back to the product is the cost.  Most protein supplements cost a little more than half the cost of ORGAIN, but being organic I guess justified the higher cost.  I would highly recommend this product.",Orgain,5

"One of our dogs whom we adopted as an adult had torn cranial cruciate ligaments in both back legs and a really difficult time getting around.  We opted for surgery on one leg to see if it would help, but the repair did not improve her mobility.  After two years of glucosamine supplements, she is tearing around the yard after our two younger dogs again.  It used to be a struggle to feed her the giant pills, and to remember them every day.  Now we just give the two younger dogs their Greenies and she gets her special one all at once as a daily treat--she views it as a reward, and it's easy for us to be consistent.  They are also labeled by week-day so that my partner and I no longer become confused about whether one of us has already medicated the dog on any given day.<br /><br />She has been on these for half a year now, and if anything, she has improved from her time on the pill supplements.  About a month ago she jumped onto our bed, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  We were delighted; for a long time she could barely stand up.  If your older dog has limited mobility due to joint problems, definitely give these a chance!",Much better than pills,5
"I finally bought the 6 pack of 24 of this tea as it is one of my favorite Tazo black teas on Amazon. They are really convenient to use and easy to take along in tea bag form. I also get the loose leaf version at (which is bolder) at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a tin. It is a nice mixed flavor of English Breakfast (Twinings brand is best for English Breakfast in my opinion) and ever so slightly Earl Grey and other black teas. The Tazo Awake black tea is not as strong as some but bold in flavor or aroma, the loose leaf version by Tazo is even more so. I don't drink caffeine in the form of sodas or coffee but I do drink lots of tea and I don't ever feel wired or caffeine'd out after a few cups of tea each day. Tazo has impressed with both their loose leaf and tea bag versions. Seep it long enough to get the bold color, flavor and aroma but don't over do it as the tea will have bitterness if you leave it seeping too long.",Great black tea,5
"Blackberry, in my own opinion, is the best tasting!

"Starbucks will not use any artificial flavors in their coffee. For this reason, they were not quick to offer flavored whole bean or ground flavored coffee products. In the shops they offer to add flavoring to already brewed coffee. I was very impressed by the ingredients of this coffee. They actually added ground vanilla beans! The flavor of the ground vanilla beans really cuts through the much stronger coffee flavor. After all, vanilla is a subtle flavor. The coffee beans used are very robust in flavor, typical of Starbucks coffee.  They also add sarsaparilla root as well. Sold at a reasonable price, I highly recommend this coffee for those who appreciate a full bodied flavored coffee.",Unique all natural flavored coffee,5

"Not much to say about green beans other than they were clean, no extras like sticks or stones and packaged well.  Less than ten bucks a pound with shipping is a good price for small quantities.  Normally if my funds allow I buy around ten pounds and that gets the shipped price per pound down to around seven bucks for Costa Rican coffee. That's from a different vendor.  For a 1 pound emergency order I am very happy.  These are good beans for a decent price and they showed up on time.  How can you go wrong?<br /><br />Now that I've roasted these beans I have to update my review.  They are very good, same quality as the other online vendors.  While I don't have the best equipment I have been roasting for several years so I'm not just blowing smoke.  I roasted these past first crack to about 435 degrees. I like to bring them up slower than the 30 degrees per minute I see recommended all over the place online.  If you like the fruity flowery roasts that's a good speed.<br /><br />I like dark and nutty or chocolatey so I try to shoot for about 20 degrees a minute.  Not difficult in my hotrod air popper but quite a chore when indoors with my freshroast.  I know that nutty sounds funny when not going to second crack but it's all in the heat curve, you can get these earthy flavors from a lighter roast if you but take your time.<br /><br />There are candy bars that would love to smell as good as these beans after they were roasted.",Good Stuff,5

Each treat is a 1 ½ inch round, with the slight consistency and look of a shortbread cookie, and has a fairly decent smell for the human nose. You can easily break them into 4 or more pieces for your cat.<br /><br />These round treats are for both dogs and cats, and are estimated as 1 or 2 for every 20 lbs. of weight. At the rate Maggie would like to eat these, she'd have to let out the buttons in her fur jacket. It's nice though that I've found something she likes, and that it's such a healthy treat. Thank you Nature's Variety for making a treat made of good, natural food for our fussy fur friends. Packaging is good, with a clear resealable bag inside the cardboard display box.","Maggie Sez ""More!""",5
"When I opened the bottle first thing I did was to check the aroma. The smell is very fruity and extremely olive like unlike any other oil. I absolutely love this olive oil. I just used a bread to dip in it. However, its not cloudy as mentioned in the description. Its really not a deciding factor for me but thought of mentioning. This thing is really olivey. Even my burps have an olive flavor.",Excellent !!,5
So good,Worth every penny,5
"Someone gave me a box of these, and they were the best cookies I ever ate -- tasty, chocolaty, and just the right amount of crispiness.

"Pamela's all purpose mix is exactly what the gluten free folk out there need. It's like using regular white flour in almost everything.

I only went gluten free about 2 years ago, but I used Pamela's products before going GF because I liked the taste of them!",Yummy!,5

"This is the heartiest of the Eden Miso packets and it does have a very good flavor along with great lasting quality (it took me over a year to use up 3 packs). People tend to make the mistake of thinking that because Miso is soy based it will be salty when mixed with liquid but this is less often the case. You can add soy sauce or Tamari for salt purpose, Miso is just the base. I saw a review that panned this Eden Shiro Miso, Organic Rice & Soybean, 12.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3) but Miso and Rice are about the most bland combination you can start with and must be seasoned to taste. That's why I start with this Barley mix, it has a more robust flavor to begin with but making Miso is about finding the base flavor that you like beyond the seasoning which comes later (some might prefer a thinner rice base). So in sum this Miso Barley has a strong flavor, holds up well to just about any use including thicker sauces and can provide a lot of base when mixed into soup.",Excellent Miso,5
"These flatbreads are definitely my favorite cracker, but they're messy when I break them apart to have something closer to bite-sized.<br /><br />Caution: Despite the description that they are made with spelt and good for people with wheat issues, people with celiac disesase cannot eat these. Spelt has gluten and the flatbreads contain barley malt. I love them and heartily recommend them, but please don't misunderstand the nature of spelt and accidentally serve them to someone with gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Oh, yes, great price at Amazon compared to my local grocery store. I hope that advantage continues.",my favorite cracker,5

"The key to enjoyment with these:  Use a keurig that has a small/large cup setting. Microwave/stove-top heat a 3rd of what you want to drink of milk to a boil. Put the milk in the mug, and brew the hot chocolate directly into it. Top with whipped cream.<br /><br />IF you drink it this way, its perfect, otherwise there's a slight after taste(just like every other cocoa mix if you ask me).",Must add milk!,5
"I think this product is absolutely great. I just gulped down 16 ounces of water flavored with one of these Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I really loved it!<br /><br />But, then again, mango is one of my favorite flavors. Pineapple is in there, too, but I think the mango stands out. Either way, it tastes delicious.<br /><br />You just empty one of the long, narrow packets into 16.9-ounces of water -- either a bottle (and shake well) or a glass (and stir well). I used a glass of water, but will try it in a bottle of water on my next long, hot walk.<br /><br />Packets are scored, so they're easy to open -- a real plus -- and easy to pour into either a bottle or a glass.<br /><br />Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors.

"My fiance was diagnosed w/ celiac two months ago, and it has been really difficult for the both of us.  I normally would bake cookies, brownies, or cupcakes once a week for him (he has a big sweet tooth!), but since the gluten-free diet started, I haven't made any g-free treats- the ingredients are expensive, and rarely available at our small-town grocery store. When I saw this mix for a little over $4, I grabbed it. I undercooked them a little (as I always do with brownies) and they were gooey deliciousness! I could barely tell the difference between these and the regular Betty Crocker brownies. I can't wait to try the cake and cookie mixes!",OMG- I almost cried when I tried these!,5

"This formula is the best out there. Don't be a media-hype sucker. The media are well paid to produce unnecessary hysteria by big business like Hain Celestial Group who happen to produce EVERY organic baby formula including the store brands, except Nature's Only. A little convenient no? Look, EVERY piece of produce you eat, organic or not, and anything produced from that produce has arsenic along with many other heavy metals in it, from past pesticide abuse. Your tap water, well water, even the bottled spring water and juices you drink have more arsenic in them in some cases than this formula. The Dartmouth Doctor who did the testing has admitted as much plus stated the testing they used has an inaccuracy of up to 40%! They did not use the government standard. To boot the other formulas use corn syrup which was recently found to have high levels of mercury and that stupid Life's DHA which is derived from algae using horrible chemicals like hexane. You are telling me that's safer?<br />My daughter has thrived on this formula. I have never had to switch her from anything. Once I stopped breastfeeding, I went right to this and have never had issues. My older son on the other hand, I had to switch the big brand formulas like five time to finally have one that didn't make him sick with digestive issues and colic plus eczema! By that point he was almost off of formula. I swore I would not make the same mistake again and I fully trust and believe in this formula.<br /> I am so tired of this world's misinformation for financial gain at the cost of our health. Please do some research about EVERYTHING you put in your and your children's mouths before you put it in you. The reality is that this one news story has possibly permanently damaged a reputable small business trying to feed our kids right.",Don't believe the hype people!!

They had no stool problems, itchiness, vomiting that others have suggested. I am still quite pleased with Canidae and will continue to use it for all of my dogs.",still a wonderful food,5

As I'm writing this (8/24/12) the price of a 24-pack is $34.99 from the cheapest 3rd-party retailer, which is absolutely ridiculous.

"I was a little leery about using this mix based off the few 1 star reviews. I bought it for $5 from a natural food store to make a bundt cake for a dear friend with soy allergies. When I was mixing it up using an electric mixer, I tried some of the batter. I was also concerned as it was gritty, but crossed my fingers and didn't mix it any longer than I do other cake batters (a few minutes using a rubber spatula along the edge of the bowl to make sure it was mixed).<br /><br />I was able to get enough for a Nordicware bunt cake pan and a few cupcakes. I decided to try a cupcake to make sure it was decent. The cupcake was delicious and moist with the corner edges that were slightly crunchy (something that could be avoided by a shorter cook time, but I liked it). My friend's cake was softer when I took it out (but fully cooked). When it cools down, I'll sprinkle it with powdered sugar. I can't wait to give it to her and her family! :)<br /><br />It's possible the 1-star reviewers got duds for their cake mixes, but it sounds like their cakes may have overbaked. Here's a tip that may help others in the future:<br /><br />Unless you are doing a box of Betty Crocker-type instant mix or maybe using lots of crisco/lard, a chocolate cake can overbake into a dry brick in minutes. Watch your chocolate cake like a hawk. I've ruined many 5-star cake recipes like that.<br /><br />Start checking on your cake with a toothpick (or a skinny smooth chopstick) 5 minutes before the minimum end time. If it's not done, put it back in and check it every five minutes. It also really helps to use an oven thermometer (putting it where the cake goes after the oven is preheated) as a lot of oven have temperatures that are off.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but chocolate cakes seem to dry out faster than other cakes, and I bet it's even more so with this mix as the brown rice's texture would become way more pronounced with even a little overbaking. Hope this helps. Happy baking! :D",Love This - Careful about Baking It,5

"I first used the Keurig machine at work and quickly became hooked.  When leaving my last job I was given a home brewer as a parting gift by my co-workers.  I was thrilled to have one at home as I usually drink coffee at home only on weekends. Before I was always brewing a larger pot than I needed and throwing a lot out, or drinking more than I really wanted so as not to waste it.  Even though the K-cups are more expensive, just knowing I can make one cup of great coffee anytime the mood strikes is great! Sometimes I want one cup after dinner and this is perfect!  I've read some of these reviews talking about the cup sizes; if I select the large cup serving, it almost runs out of a regular/medium cup,especially if I pre-add a little half & half.  I feel the taste is always consistent.  I like the Donut Shop for mornings and the Tully's Kona Blend for the evenings.  I just purchased the Ekobrew and am anxious to try it this weekend.

"TABASCO sauce was the best mistake my mother has ever made. She somehow accidentally purchased it instead of our normal ""hot sauce"" , and in the absence of ""hot sauce"" we had to use this wonderful concoction know as TABASCO sauce instead. I was skeptical at first when applying it to my food. Initially the TABASCO sauce seemed watery to me, it is definitely not a thick sauce, it appears diluted when compared other ""hot sauces"". I was worried it would not provide the same kick as my everyday ""hot sauce"", boy was I wrong. The TABASCO sauce provided more of a ""kick"" than my normal ""hot sauce"", this was a pleasant surprise, but that's not all. The thing I like most about TABASCO sauce is it taste amazing on food. I first tried my TABASCO sauce on fried fish, it was great, then the next thing I knew I was putting it on hamburgers. I have never put a hot sauce on a hamburger, but I figured why not - this stuff is amazing. TABASCO sauce blends perfectly with any food you would normally put any other ""hot sauce"" on. Another thing I like about the sauce is, if you eat a piece of food with hot sauce on it, you don't immediately taste the hot sauce. The heat slowly builds in your mouth. Which is how hot sauce should be.<br /><br />Pros<br />* Great Taste<br />* Not Very Acidic<br />* Heat Slowly Builds<br />Cons<br />* Pricy  It is worth it )<br />* Small Bottle  This stuff vanished in my house )<br /><br />Verdict : BUY this hot sauce, at least once to try it out.

It's funny to see that I'm not the only one who thought this smells and tastes like cherry! Everyone I asked to smell it said I was crazy. I suppose it depends on your sense of smell. If you love rooibos, black cherries, almonds, and vanilla, you'll love this tea too. If you've never had rooibos, good luck with getting any idea of what it tastes like before you actually taste it. It's pretty hard to describe, but it's very pleasant. Once again, this is one amazing tea!",Amazing!,5

"This is the best tasting decaf I have found.  I tried about a dozen different brands and this was the only one that I found to have the richness of regular without any sourness.  The grind is fine enough to use in my Jura automatic espresso machine. It makes fine French press too but reduce the steep time to accomodate the finer grind.<br /><br />MY STORY:<br />As a nursing mother I need to watch my caffeine intake.  As a former full-time graphic designer, I had a massive coffee habit that needed taming.  I really LOVE the taste of coffee and was used to having 2 double lattes a day, one in morning and one around 2:30 PM.  So I tried doing one shot regular espresso and one shot decaf espresso in both my lattes to cut my daily intake by half and spread out the caffeine out so my body could process it without passing a huge slug of it to my baby.  It worked ok but the decaf never tasted right, it always lacked richness and tasted sour; until I ordered this.  I was amazed and delighted that this decaf really tastes like REAL coffee!  No sour notes or weakness to spoil the great flavor of my regular shot of espresso.  Now both shots tasted great and this momma gets her coffee AND has a baby that still naps soundly.<br /><br />WORTH EVERY PENNY!",BEST decaf coffee I have found!,5

"This Perrier flavor (Grapefruit) has been very difficult to find locally other than in convenince stores (sometimes) and then only in single bottles.  I was very happy to find these in a 24 package from Amazon.  Ordered 2 cases and they shipped quickly.  They were packaged in a larger cardboard box and arrived fine.  Only negative was the original plastic wrapper around the case came apart while removing the case from the box - no big deal, just had bottles scatter across the floor (they are plastic so no danger).  Next time I will take them out expecting the wrapper to not hold the bottles.

"UPDATED REVIEW 4/2/08:<br /><br />SAD NEWS. KRAFT HAS TOTALLY REFORMULATED THIS DRESSING. IT NO LONGER CONTAINS LEMON JUICE AND HAS A STRONG SOUR VINEGAR TASTE. THEY ALSO INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES IN THE DRESSING. THERE ARE VERY FEW MILD, LOW CAL, NON SWEET VINEGRETTES OUT THERE. IT'S A SHAME THAT KRAFT KILLED THIS ONE.<br /><br />--OLD REVIEW--<br /><br />This is a refreshing light and not very  sweet vinagrette that tastes more of lemon juice than vinegar and has a nice garlic and pepper kick.<br /><br />In this day and age of sugary and gummy diet dressings this awesome dressing is a breath of fresh air!!<br /><br />I believe this is Krafts original vinaigrette dressing which leads me to one caveat: Like it did in the old days, it contains MSG. Now unless you are sensitive to MSG, this is actually a very GOOD THING. It makes the salad sing with taste even though the dressing only has 50 calories in two tablespoons. That would not be possible without MSG and which is why I think so many salad dressings these days are sugary bland disasters - because the manufacturers are afraid to add MSG. Sometimes  politically incorrect ingredients from the old days are great!<br /><br />I love to use 2 or three tablespoons of this dressing over a huge veggie and feta cheese salad... it makes those veggies sing on your tongue!!!<br /><br />Get it quick, I heard rumors that Kraft may be thinking of killing this product off. I hope not!!!!!",My very favorite diet salad dressing,5

At only 92 calories per stick these are a great dog treat. These are a good size treat and being hard and crunchy help keep dogs occupied and also help with breath and teeth. For dogs with sensitive digestion these are gluten free and are made with high protein grain. For human noses these have a slight smell that is not overpowering.<br /><br />We have three dogs with the smallest being around 50-55 pounds. Our puppy is around 65-70 and our biggest around 90 pounds. All three enjoyed the treat stick. Obviously these are all big dogs so I can't speak for small dogs but when all of ours enjoy them I can recommend these to all big dog owners.,3 out of 3 dogs approve,5
"These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read ""Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!""<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!

"Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.

"I have tried a number of peanut butters - I LOVE peanut butter.  I search the grocery store for peanut butter that is both affordable AND has one or (if I'm desperate) two ingredients: peanuts and if I must, salt.<br /><br />Krema peanut butter is our family's favourite.  It is a great peanut-ty taste.  Until we made the switch to natural, unadulterated peanut butter, I never thought that it tasted much like peanut butter.  I liked it, but it wasn't really peanut-ty.  Once you know what real peanut butter tastes like (and perhaps get used to the lack of sugar) the common stuff like Jif just tastes like nothing.<br /><br />Anyway, what I like most about the Krema peanut butter (we get smooth) is that we can stir it, refrigerate it and it still stays spreadable.  Most of the other peanut butters I tried required refrigeration but then would end up being hard and impossible to spread.  We make a lot of bread in our house so attempting to spread a cold solid on fresh bread is rather frustrating!<br /><br />I came here on Amazon to check prices, but it turns out that my local supermarket actually has a cheaper price for once!  Guess I'll keep shopping local.",Our favourite REAL peanut butter,5
"Tofu Shirataki is simply amazing.  Anyone who says that it tastes or smells funny has not prepared it correctly.  To prepare:  drain and then rinse VERY well.  At this point, I prefer to cut the noodles up a bit.  Boil 2-3 minutes- any longer and the pasta will become tough.  Pat dry and add your favorite sauce.<br /><br />These taste just like pasta, but with SOOO many fewer calories.  This is not just a food for people 'trying to lose weight', as other reviewers have said.  This is a food for health-conscious consumers.  For me, this has been the find of a lifetime.  There are so many different recipes you can use them in, and they taste simply fantastic.  In fact, with sauce, they taste just like pasta (and who doesn't love pasta?).<br /><br />I learned about Tofu Shirataki through Hungry Girl.  On her web site, she has tons of low-calorie recipes using Tofu Shirataki [...]<br /><br />For anyone who has tried these and disliked them, please give them another try.  Make sure to drain and REALLY rinse the pasta before boiling.  The scent will vanish.  Cutting the pasta up helps as well, since it is slightly slippery.  Try it with a cheesy pasta bake, with your favorite marinara sauce, or even in soup!  The options are limitless.  This truly is a fantastic, fantastic product.",BEST FOOD FIND EVER!!!!,5

One thing to note is that it brings the TDS down by almost 90%, so depending on the water quality one might have to get TDS adjuster installed to get the right TDS.

Also, I believe it's helped me with my cholesterol imbalance. I tested once at a low HDL (good) level.  After some research on the benefits of unrefined coconut oil on cholesterol, I gave it a try.

"I've been buying coconut oil for a long time.  I've always been satisfied with what I got, after all, what can coconut oil be?  Then I tried this one.  It has a light, delicate flavor and a wonderful texture.  I use it in my hair, to shave, on my skin, to fry eggs, to mix with other ingredients.  It adds a nice touch to chocolate cake and goes well with most flavors of cheesecake.  I like this well enough to have a subscription.  First class stuff.",Wonderful stuff,5
Very good and nutritious too.  Nice as a snack.  I love the fact there is no gluten as I have allergies.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  Thanks!,yummy,5

"I love this stuff! Wild Ride Hoppin' Hickory (Hormone and Antibiotic Free) has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 200 calories, or 50 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Hoppin' Hickory has a spicy and smoky flavor that is perfectly balanced and not too overpowering. MMmmmm! Yummy!",Awesome taste!,5

My holistic doctors have warned me off against using products like Splenda, Aspartame, and Sweet & Low.  Most of them recommend Stevia as an alternative, but I found Xylitol and it is as close to sugar as I have found.  I use it in hot tea, in smoothies, on my cereal in the morning, and elsewhere.  I am amazed at how satisfying it is, and I no longer have a need for sugar at all.  It has been replaced!!!  Not to mention it is better for me, has less calories, and is good for my teeth.

"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****","Superb Green Tea, Organic, Excellent!",5
"Eden's canned tomato products are excellent. The cans are lined to prevent the acidic tomatoes from coming in contact with the metal from the can. Very well done! I teach a variety of cooking and health workshops and I am a certified holistic health coach and these are the only brand of tomato I can confidently recommend! Eden is also a small dedicated organic company, so I feel I can't go wrong supporting them.",Always fabulous and safe!,5
"I got these looking for good finger foods for my daughter. While the pieces are still a little big for her, she loves the flavors. I really like that they're sweet and nutritous, providing a good alternative to junk foods. I also love that they're available for subscribe and save. I'll be looking forward to my next shipment!",THESE ARE SO GOOD!,5
"I have been drinking Tipu's Chai religiously for over a year now. I prefer the Chai now simple life. It has the most wonderful flavors an allows me to add almond milk and my own sweetener (stevia). I had to stop drinking coffee for health reasons and Tipu chai has made the transition so easy. I need to get some decaf too so I can have it at night. The price point scared me at first but you barely have to use any of the powder to make a nice cup of tea. I use less than the recommended amount. All in all I highly recommend Tipu's Chai. It is authentic, has simple ingredients, and is affordable.",The best Chai ever!,5
This tea was very good. I was Very happy I got it. A tea that is so good for you and will help many things in your body. My breathing felt better after the first cup. I will be buying more again soon. Doug in Calif...,A very fine Tea,5

"I used this apple butter in a few cake, granola and chicken recipes. My cakes came out nice and moist, my granola bars were delicious and my family loved this on chicken. I pounded chicken breasts very thin and coated them in apple butter and then rolled them in bread crumbs. I baked them for a half hour at 350 degrees. Delicious. This is a great natural apple butter with no high fructose corn syrup. I highly recommend it!",Wonderful natural apple butter for baking and cooking,5

Have been receiving Coffee People Jet Fuel K-cups along with other flavors and it's great to receive the boxes of 50 k-cups on a regular basis. Also it's very cost effective. The Jet Fuel is great if you like a robust coffee. Would recommend the coffee and Amazon for this type of purchase.<br /><br />Very satisfied-Bill.D,k-cup's,5
"I love this vanilla bean paste (more of a syrup, really). The black vanilla beans speckles add a real look and taste to my baked goods! I've used LorAnn Oil's Madagascar Vanilla Extract before and did not like the aftertaste. This doesn't taste like it has as much alcohol in it, but I'm not sure. I prefer this paste to any other vanilla extracts I've ever tried!",Better than extract!,5
This product wonderful,Awesome,5

"To my taste, the Stash brand of Earl Grey Black Tea (in tea bags) is the best I have found. After trying Twinings, Bigelow and a few others, I discovered Stash and found it to have a fresher, cleaner taste with a more pronounced bergamot fragrance. It costs slightly more than the others but seems well worth it to me. Also, buying it in quantity through Amazon brings the cost down significantly as compared to local grocery chains.",Stash Brand Earl Grey Tea,5

"I used to be able to buy this cappuccino locally, but the store does not carry it any longer. It is the only cappuccino my 79 year old mother likes. I searched everywhere and could not find it, so I turned to Amazon, and there it was!! I have the automatic shipments going to my mom for a year round Mother's Day Gift. She is happy and my life is much easier!! If you want a cappuccino that is NOT chocolaty then this is the one for you!!",Mom loves it!,5
"Normally I don't even think about drinking vodka (too many bad college memories!) until my husband brought this home one night. He claimed it was a sipping vodka and in all honesty there was no way I could believe him. So against my better judgment I decided to mix it with some orange juice. Wow...I have never tasted a vodka so smooth and there was no burning sensation and rubbing alcohol aftertaste. Even when you shoot it there isn't a burning sensation and almost feels like you are drinking water. And come on now, the bottle is pretty freakin cool! A must try vodka for the non-vodka drinkers.",Super smooth vodka,5

Great for when I want to make coffee that is not available or on hand in K cups. Also it's a great money saver. I use these all the time as well as the K cups and I don't notice the difference in coffee quality. The K cups can get pricey if you drink as much coffee as I do and these little guys save me big time. I highly recommend these and I'm buying another set for my sister.,"Great product, I love these Kaps",5
Now Grain Free Turkey and Duck Formula dog food is great.  My shelties love it and I love that it has no junk in the formula.  It is healthy for my pets.  I receive my orders in a timely fashion and usually sooner than expected.  Amazon is great in getting the orders out.,My shelties love this dog food,5
These treats have more nutritional value than others I have seen.  No guilt about giving them to my kitties and they love them.  I mix a few in with their regular dry food.,Some of their favorite treats,5
"This stuff is so delicious, I love it.  I've already ordered a second round of them.  Just the right amount of spice.",I love this stuff,5
The price stinks horribly especially if you have to pay for shipping but thankfully we've got prime so it makes it a little easier to swallow the price. I use PB2 for my protein shakes and oh man does it kick up the taste and makes it even sweeter knowing Im not getting all the fat and calories as you do in regular premade peanut butter. It's always a wonderful alternative to use in peanut butter cookies. The kids NEVER know the difference either.,Absolutely FABULOUS!!,5

"Gourmet chocolate is everywhere, and I try as much of it as I possibly can.  I have a bias toward dark chocolate, and I am a big Mocha fan.  However, if you think you are going to get a Mocha Frappuccino in a candy bar, think again.<br /><br />This is serious dark chocolate with little bits of coffee beans in every bite.  Do not eat it before bed (I learned the hard way).  I would say taking a bite of this chocolate is every bit as stimulating as a cup of coffee.<br /><br />The taste is great, not too sweet, with the smoothness of the chocolate providing a perfect counterpoint to the slight crunchiness of the coffee.  To me it is much more satisfying (and less dramatic) than munching on chocolate covered coffee beans.  It is, in fact, the best combination of chocolate and coffee that I have found, in any format.",Chocolate for grownups,5

"I've started my dietary lifestyle change about 2 months ago and needed to starting eating more whole grain foods, nuts and seeds. Bob Red Mill whole raw flaxseed made these convenient for my busy life. I prefer to get my nutrients from plant sources rather than supplements so I grind about 1 cup and store in freezer and add about 2 tbs with my breakfast.

"This syrup is delicious. It is the same syrup used to many chain restaurants and coffee shops to make a variety of iced and hot coffee drinks.

"I just love this coffee. It is very complex in tastes. I got a few through a trade and kept putting off ordering it. I would say it is a light/medium roast. I really hate dark chocolate but in this coffee it is amazing. The raspberry and dark chocolate are ""true"" in taste. I use sugar and cream/creamer and it is like a dessert without the calories. I don't want to be without it in my cupboard. Which is why I wish it were on subscribe and save program here on Amazon (hint).",Just The Best,5
"I'm happy to report that someone has finally figured out how to create a healthy snack that also tastes good. Once I opened the package, I literally could not keep my hand out of this bag of healthy grains. Composed of 100% whole grains and fruit, this snack is low in fat, high in fiber, and quite versatile. It tastes great by itself, mixed into yogurt, sprinkled over a fruit salad, or eaten with milk much like conventional cereal. Plus, a little goes a long way--it won't take much to fill you up. I'm pretty sure I have a new favorite snack!",Healthy AND tasty. Wow.,5

"I ate beef jerky every single day at my school cafeteria when I was growing up. I loved the stuff. And then I became a vegetarian and, alas, I thought my beef jerky days were done for. Until I discovered this. It is very convincing - the texture isn't gross or suspect like many fake meat products. It isn't too tough, is a bit moist, and has a nice flavor. It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater. My dad even liked it, which is saying a lot - he is an old school eater who was very skeptical of anything vegetarian.",Very Convincing Meat Replacement,5

Her dog, Mr. Quiggs gives it ""two paws up.""  Full of real food and the end result is easy to scoop - hey, that rhymes with poop!  Cowboy will pick out the peas (yes, there are real peas in there) and eat the rest of the food first - either he saves the best for last or he really doesn't like peas.  I'm guessing the latter.

"These Graham Crackers are definitely a cut above the regular graham crackers. They have a great flavor, are crunchy and hold up well to dunking. They taste much better than Nabisco and most store brands. We have a box of the Nabisco Honey Graham Crackers and I definitely prefer the Back to Nature Graham Crackers. The Nabisco (and most others) have a somewhat bland flavor where the Back to Nature have a very good flavor that is noticeable. I have a sweet tooth and these would definitely satisfy it and would also be much healthier but I would still prefer these even if they weren't healthier.",Excellent Graham Crackers!,5
