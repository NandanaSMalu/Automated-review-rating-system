"I bought a box for wholefoods and was so excited to make tapioca pudding last night!  What a disappointment.<br /><br />Who ever created the back of the box is a total dimwit.  And shame on me for following them blindly.<br /><br />First of all, they claim that one teaspoon = one serving and that there are 17 servings in the box.<br /><br />Second, the recipe never mentions the temperature you should cook the pudding, whether you should cover the pot, etc.  It simply says to boil water, add tapioca, cook for 17 minutes.  But if you do this on high, you will burn your pot dry.<br /><br />Third, the recipe calls for 3 teaspoons of tapioca.  Given what I wrote above, you might think this would be three servings.  Instead, this makes, as expected, maybe an 1/8 of a serving.<br /><br />Finally, the pudding was inedible.  It called for 3 T sugar, 3 T tapioca and coconut milk (which boiled down to nothing).  Ugh!  It came out to be a sugar syrup with hard tapioca balls.  Terrible!<br /><br />If you want a decent recipe for tapioca pudding, try soaking the tapioca overnight, and following the recipe on the website Simply Recipes.  I made the pudding the day after and it was truly excellent.",Worst recipe ever,1

"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients.

"I usually love Kashi's products, but this one is not good at all.  I LOVE dark chocolate and I LOVE coconut, so I thought these were going to be pretty much the best thing ever.  As soon as I got them home, I opened one to try it.  I was sadly disappointed in both the chocolate and coconut taste of this bar.  The so-called ""dark chocolate"" is a paste-like frosting that, being chocolate, obviously should taste good, but has a weird texture that makes it gross.  I was thinking it was going to be like a layer of actual chocolate, similar to the layer of chocolate on the bottom of Kashi's Go-Lean Crunch bars (which are totally yummy), not chocolate flavored frosting on the top of the granola bar.  Second, these do NOT taste like coconut at all.  There is a sprinkling of dried coconut on the top of the nasty frosting, but you can't even taste it, mostly because the chocolate-y taste of the paste, uh, I mean frosting overwhelms it.  My kids won't even eat them and they will eat anything with frosting on it.  Actually, I guess now I have to say they will eat ALMOST anything with frosting on it.  I would skip these in favor of ANY OTHER Kashi granola bar.  Don't waste your money, unless you like to eat paste and have always been searching for a chocolate flavored paste (with a sprinkling of coconut) to smear on a granola bar.",Frosting on a Granola bar?

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.

"I use coconut milk daily and this is the only coconut milk I buy because I appreciate that Native Forest uses BPA-free cans and is organic.<br />I've been buying this from Amazon for over a year--I used to buy it on subscription before they canceled subscription availability.<br /><br />Up till now there has never been a problem with my orders. But yesterday I received my latest 12 pack and EVERY single can in it is dented. Four had very minor dents near the top, but eight cans had large noticeable dents.<br /><br />While I imagine that the product inside is probably fine, I am very concerned about this lapse in quality control in the manufacturing and/or distibution process. Dents can weaken the metal and introduce tiny cracks that allow contamination of the product.<br /><br />I notice a lot of very recent comments on Amazon stating that others are receiving dented cans as well. I hope Amazon and/or Native Forest will address this.<br /><br />I am not sure if it's a distribution problem--if the cans are being damaged in shipping (they came double boxed from Amazon, so perhaps damage occurs further upstream in the shipping line), or if Amazon is only managing to source damaged cans in the first place, or ...?<br /><br />I want to offer full stars for the product, which I like and truly rely on, but I'm offering a low rating because of the packaging.",All 12 cans dented!

"The text on this can of No Fear Super Energy Supplement is very blurred, like the red ink doesn't line up with the rest of the print on the can, so I didn't try too hard to read it before I started drinking it.  I was a little more than halfway through the can when I realized that there are two servings per can--does anyone save half a can for later?  If you can figure out a way to do that it's probably a good idea, since each serving will give you 33 grams of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup.  I could have eaten a candy bar and come out ahead.<br /><br />All that sugar, plus 87 mg of caffeine (per serving) did give my skull wings, right before the sugar crash that followed.<br /><br />The flavor is far too sweet for my tastes, with kind of a weird fruit flavor.  It felt like the inside of my mouth was coated with syrup, like I'd been drinking cough syrup.  Come to think of it, this would probably make a great flavor for kids' cough syrup.<br /><br />It wouldn't work as a kids' drink, though.  The label warns: ""Not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine.""  Those who are allergic should know that it also contains soy.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sugar boost but couldn't possibly eat another bag of Skittles, this is for you.  If all you want is the ""proprietary blend"" containing taurine, inositol, caffeine, ginseng root extract, grape seed extract, l-carnitine, and l-arginine, you might want to check out the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO3AUW"">sugar free</a> version.","Nice energy boost, followed by a hard sugar crash",1

"I fed this flavor to my cat for over two and a half years (as a kitten he ate grain-free Innova), almost exclusively wet food. If he got hungry later I'd give him a tiny sprinkle of Wellness dry (salmon), but twice a day he got this food. He developed urinary crystals TWICE even though the food says it's designed to prevent this problem.<br /><br />I was a big believer in healthy, grain-free, wet food, ""natural"" cat food diets. Even when I was unemployed for a year, my cat continued to eat Wellness while I ate instant noodles. It was fine, I thought I was feeding him the best and pre-emptively striking against any preventable health problems. Well, he got urinary crystals on one occasion; I brought him to the vet, $1,000 later and he seemed fine. The vet cautioned me against returning to the same diet but I somehow thought it would be okay and that the diet wasn't to blame. Well, it was. A few months later he got the same problem. Another $1,000 later and boarding for four days, my vet (whom I've trusted with all my pets, dearly, for many years) told me that (1) the ""natural pet food craze"" was overblown and ridiculous, that he's fed a leading brand of standard grocery store cat food and has had cats live beyond 19 years; (2) the diet was the cause of my cat's troubles, and I had to change it.<br /><br />Well, now he's on prescription food that's even more expensive than the fancy stuff but with seemingly far less high-quality ingredients. But he hasn't had the problem come back, and from what I can tell, he's got the same energy levels and healthy coat as before, just minus the urinary troubles. The stray cats my family and I feed (six others) all get the junky grocery stuff like Friskies, Fancy Feast, and Purina, and they have never needed to go to the hospital. I know diet isn't the only factor but it is certainly the major one. I would rather have my cat eating food that doesn't send him to the hospital with a life-threatening condition, than one that makes me feel good about its ""naturalness."" Mind you, urinary crystals are severely painful and will kill your cat if not treated within hours. This food might work for many owners but I'm not taking the risk again.",Seemed like a good food but caused urinary crystals twice,1

The pieces were thick and flat, which is more attractive than the wrinkly stuff.

All that fat didn't make it more tender or less chewy.  And that fat is displacing protein in a 1 oz serving, so 1 0z. delivers 90 calories instead of 70.

"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5.

"First of all, this was a LOT of tea.  Two large boxes (each over 10"" x 6"" x 4"") that contain a ton of tea bags, each round and filled with a generous amount of tea.  The boxes weigh about 28 ounces each, more than listed.  That's 3 and a half pounds of tea.  And the steeped tea is a nice rich orange color.  And, with regret, I just threw out one unopened box and and the remaining 2/3 of the bags of the other.<br /><br />Why?  Because although the tea starts out tasting rich and good, it turns foul and bitter after several minutes.  At least it does when mixed with moderate amounts of sugar and fresh milk.<br /><br />Although Orange Pekoe refers to a GRADE of tea, having to do with the size of the broken up leaf particles, in North America it is generally thought to refer to the COLOR.  Orange color in tea is a result of oxidation of the tea.  And this tea must be really oxidized, because it does have a rich orange color that appears remarkably quickly, after steeping for as little as 45 seconds.  I've never run across a tea that steeped more quickly.  In an effort to avoid the bitterness that develops, I tried quicker and quicker steeps, and even experimented with cooler water.  But nothing helped.  If steeped too quickly, it just tasted thin and yucky.  I guess there is such a thing as TOO oxidized.<br /><br />Too bad, because the initial taste is good and you sure get a lot of tea.  But unless you drink a full cup in about two minutes, you won't like the taste that develops.","Alas, not good",1

"I guess the people at amazon who decided this Nielsen Massey Orange Flower<br />Water is a good substitute for Monteux can't taste, smell or feel.

That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.<br /><br />Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.<br /><br />But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles.

Took her to the vet, and he said that he has seen this type of food cause the urine to be too acidic and cause an infection. He told me to STOP feeding her ""Buffalo"" and to go back to old brand. After 1 day of not feeding it to her, and the first day on her round of pills, she is much butter and no more blood in her urine.<br />Like I said... could be totally unrelated, but seems obvious that the problem started within 3 days of feeding this to her, and the problem stopped (per advice of vet) when I stopped feeding it to her.<br />I am writing this to inform you, in case you have the same issue and to hopefully save someone the expense of a vet bill and all the hassle my purchase caused me.",Do More Research!,1

Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?<br /><br />I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.<br /><br />It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description.

"I initially purchased this soup because it is not packaged in a can with the carcinogen BPA, or Bisphenol A. BPA is especially bad for men since it acts as estrogen. So bear creek chicken noodle soup seemed safe. Well I found out after consuming this soup that the food industry only has to report trans fat content from triglycerides--not from monoglycerides or diglycerides. But trans fats are inevitably formed in when mono- and diglycerides are manufactured. Since bear creek soup contains both monoglycerides and diglycerides, there is in fact trans fat in the soup. So basically it is perfectly legal to say any food product does not contain trans fat when in fact it does contain trans fat. In addition to being able to put as much as 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, not in the entire package but per serving and rounding down to zero the food industry has pulled another one over consumers. So before you or your children consume any product with monoglycerides and/or diglycerides, do some research about their dangers to your health.","Warning, contains mono and digltcerides.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1
"Raw Cacao has a high Vitamin C content. This product has O% if you look at the label on the back.<br />Within the last year they covered up where it used to say Vitamin C with Vitality. If you look closely on some of the older packages, you can pull the Vitality sticker off that is covering up the vitamin C label. Which means that it has been cooked/processed in some way that removed that natural occurring Vitamin C.<br />I only use the highest quality cacao, from reputable sources. Less quality, Other ""raw"" cacao beans on the market are not only of cheap forastero cacao varieties, they also are contaminated with several types of dangerous bacteria (remember cacao is a tropical crop where microbe contamination is more difficult to control).<br />Remember you get what you pay for.

Just buy your coffee from the grocery store -any of them will rank better than this Alterra junk.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />Maybe if they bring back Flavia coffees I will venture to try it again.

"I love popcorn but don't have it very often, so when I do I want great popcorn. As odd as it may sound, I have worked at it over the years to get it ""right."" I'm satisfied with my process and usually use Orville's, but recently found that I love the popcorn at Sundance Theaters. Sometimes I stop in their lobby just to pick up a bag of popcorn to take home for supper. I learned the trick of adding a touch of coconut oil to the popping oil and now I'm on a hunt for the best popping corn. I bought this even though to me the product and shipping cost was steep. I thought that if we bonded---me and the popping corn---it would be worth it. Well, it arrived poorly packed but intact. No matter, I made a batch of popcorn that night and settled in to watch ""Leverage."" The popcorn was tasteless. Made the same way as always, it was completely tasteless. I actually threw it out, which is so unlike me. I threw out the batch and I threw out the entire bag of popping corn. I've been an Amazon.com user since its inception and I think this is only my second poor review. If the popcorn and shipping cost wasn't so pricey it would be a small matter. I just don't want someone else to overextend themselves like I did in a purchase and have such a bad experience.

"My parents are both diabetics (Type 1 and Type 2). Their blood sugar has been uncontrollable and was looking for a healthy alternative to Splenda.  Bought this last week at Whole Foods in Northbrook and it was on sale as well.<br /><br />Love the smell, but when they put it to their coffee, their blood sugar spiked 5 times the normal range.  At one point, my mom's sugar spiked to it's highest ever at 389.  She was so scared when she saw ""CHECK FOR KETONES"" on the machine.  Well, let's try baking bread and using this coconut sugar instead.  It has that same effect.  I was wondering if we could be doing something wrong.  Maybe we are using a wrong ratio to the table sugar.  My parents used the 1 to 1 ratio (e.g. 1 tsp coconut sugar = 1 tsp cane sugar).<br /><br />I really had high hopes with this product specially for my diabetic parents. I researched high and low here in Amazon and other diabetes blog sites. I have read nothing but excellent reviews of this product and other Organic Coconut Sugar.<br /><br />Please, if we are doing something wrong, let us know.  Give us some feedback.

First of all, the liquid they are packaged in smells horrible!  Does not set the stage for an appetizing meal.  The texture of the angel hair noodles which we tried was very rubbery. Even with my favorite marinara sauce, I just could not force down a full serving.  My feelings were echoed by the 3 other people in my office who tried them.  Even my husband who will eat almost anything, found the noodles unpleasant to eat and suggested that we NOT offer them to our clients.  If you have texture issues with food or you are buying them thinking they will replace pasta, forget it.

The first packet came in July, my concierge who collected the packet called me immediately stating there was a leak in the box that had arrived.<br />To my relief only one of the packs had a small leak. The packs were good sized and i knew  instantly that i had a months supply of coconut water.<br />When i chilled it and tasted it, I had mixed views, while it had  distinctive sweet flavor, there was certainly an aftertaste probably coz of the packing.

"I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.","Sickening filler ingredients, high price",1

The orzo is pretty good, but the rice, oh, the rice, what a terrible disappointment. I was surprised to see that the directions call for such a short cooking time, and sure enough, it did cook that fast. That might sound like a good thing, but the rice came out quite mushy. Looking more closely at the uncooked product, it sure looks to me like it has been processed in some way prior to packaging (maybe it has been parboiled then dried?). In any case, I'm so disappointed by this rice I'm going to give it away to a food bank and just go back to buying rice at my local health food store.<br /><br />If I'm right about the processing of this rice, it should be noted in the product info, and it isn't.

I thought, with this version (Dr Zevia) being so much more expensive and using stevia to sweeten as a healthier alternative than sugar, that this would likely be closer to the brand name beverage it was trying to be like.  Unfortunately, I found it not only wasn't closer to the flavor, it was much worse than any I had tried in the past!  It was like drinking carbonated cough syrup!  I did not return it because my son decided to drink it and suffer through it to try to reduce his caloric intake, but if he wants more of it, he will have to buy it himself.

"We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.

"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.<br /><br />I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.<br /> Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.<br /> I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.<br /> Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.<br /> I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.<br /> The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.<br /><br /> Karl and Lori<br /> Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.

"I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey cereal.  The taste is redolent of corn puffs, with a hint of Multi-grain Cheerios.  Too much honey on the front end, with corn notes that are slightly overpowering in the finish.  The bouquet has distinct peanut notes which is unsurprising as peanuts (which actually aren't a nut) are the main nut in the cereal.  Somehow this combines however, into a cereal that is at once both, overly sweet and mealy.<br /><br />I would also add that the price, $30 + $8 shipping comes out to about .88 an ounce.  Compare that to major grocery chains and other cereals, such as Crunchy Nut Roasted O's at .38/oz, or Honey nut cheerios at .28/oz, and its clear that these are horribly overpriced.<br /><br />Also, when it says nuts (and I realize I'm being a stickler), I really expect it to contain treenuts, like almonds, cashews, etc.  Peanuts are a legume, a groundnut, and technically a bean.

"Granted, my expectations from Proflower weren't exactly high. I wasn't expecting the flower to look like the picture. But was it that much to ask for some stargazer and iris buds that are alive?<br /><br />What my mother received from her so-called ""Spectacular"" was a bunch of disgusting slimy brown rotten buds. Proflower must not care about what they send out because I am 100% sure this did not happen through the shipping process. Based on tracking records, the flowers were sent out wednesday night from a location roughly 150 miles away. And it was received around thursday noon.

"I remember buying Ragu a few years ago and never buying it again, but I could not remember why. Just look at the container, its tomato sauce, what could go wrong. Everything about it is wrong for me now that I tried it once more and I am writing a review to remind me later. This contains sugar and sugar is same as poison for me, the taste just makes me mad. The container label says there is only 10g of sugar per 1/2 cup/128g serving, but when I eat it it feels like 50g. There is no tangy tomato flavor, it feels like I am eating juice or jam or something too sweet, not pasta sauce like. I compared it with a can of ""Del Monte Chunky garlic and herb"" sauce and Del Monte is so much better. It contains 9g High Fructose Syrup in place of Sugar but I felt it was much more satisfying, tastier, less sweet and more tangy than Ragu and its cheaper too. Did i miss to say Del Monte is Chunky while Ragu is not!, even when labelled Chunky. If you want to buy Del Monte sauce online with fast shipping try Amazon's grocery site ""soap"" dot com. Ragu is America's worst tasting sauce not like advertised at all, more like America's favorite Tomato flavored jam/syrup.<br /><br />Also double checked ingredient list on the bottle and it says sugar while amazon says corn syrup.

"I made this on my husband's Kuerig B70 in the 10oz size. The smell was overpowering, I could smell it in my upstairs bedrooms which are no where near the kitchen. The tea itself had a strong chemical-type taste, which in no way resembled either pomegranate, berry, or tea.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this tea as I love Gloria Jean's mango tea, and enjoyed the mixed flavor packages. Unfortunately, they've recently changed the mixed configuration to include this unpleasant concoction in place of the chai, so I won't be buying that particular package any more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I purchased 48 of these, and have tried it 4 times now, hoping it would grow on me. It hasn't, and the smell is now making me queasy.

"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: &lt;...>. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???",FYI- BEFORE YOU BUY Miracle Noodles PLEASE READ THIS!,1

"I'm a big fan of Jack Link's beef jerky, especially their flavored jerky's. I hadn't seen this one in the stores so when it went on sale on Amazon I scooped it up. Generally the beef nuggets and tendercuts style jerky's are not my favorite, for some reason the beef gets very rubbery compared to the regular style cuts, but I knew this diving into the bag of jerky.<br /><br />At first the taste was like the beef had been dropped in a pile of debris on a smokehouse floor, smokey, meaty and ashy tasting. I thought maybe it was just the initial taste  and continued to chew. It only worsened as I continued and eventually I swallowed and was met with a disgusting taste left in my mouth.<br /><br />Now that I have all four bags remaining I'm not sure what to do with them.

It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.",Some broken jars,1

"Each package comes with 8 milk creamer discs and 8 chai tea discs, making a total of 8 drinks.  You use the creamer disc first, then the tea disc.  Tassimo recommends that you run the brewer through a cleaning cycle after making a milk drink (you don't want to spoil your next non-milky drink).<br /><br />I love Chai (or spiced) tea with a little sugar or honey, so I was really looking forward to a Chai Latte made with my brand new Tassimo Brewer.  Boy was I disappointed!<br /><br />I don't see it in the description, but the tea contains sucralose (that's the sweetener in Splenda).  While I generally avoid artificial sweeteners in general, as I don't like the taste, I do make some exceptions.  It's possible to use them and have an enjoyable flavor if the flavors are balanced.<br /><br />They aren't in this Twinings Chai.  There is definitely too much sweetener.  I would prefer that they err on the side of not enough sweetener---after all, everyone has their own preferences, but I can always add more, I can't remove what's already there.<br /><br />The balance between the milk and tea was also off and the milk has a decided reconstituted dry milk taste to it.  Not my fave. ;0)  Between the sweetener overkill and the milk, it was hard to even tell that this was spiced tea or tea at all.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again.",Almost undrinkable due to the artificial sweetener taste,1

My dog and others love this treat. The problem is that hundreds and thousands of dogs have died in the US after consuming these treats. One death was that of a good friend as it killed her beautiful German Shepard.  Her death was completely avoidable because the problem with these treats was known but not publically shared. Purina claims these treats are safe and yet hundreds of dogs have died after eating them.  These treats are made in China where the problem first occured with dog and cat food years ago. Back then the problems resulted in the same initial denial.  Please read related articles on this subject and make an informed decision about purchasing these treats.,How many dogs must die before these treats are removed from the market,1

"UPDATE: April 3, 2009<br />I ""ordered"" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: ""A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE."" Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be ""healthy."" Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.<br /><br />As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The ""diet"" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of ""off the diet.""  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a ""wolf in lamb's clothing"" for those who consider themselves ""heath conscious.""<br /><br />The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:<br /><br />""The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]""<br /><br />Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas:<br />Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)<br />Servings [per can]: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g  0% DV<br />Sodium: 15mg  1% DV<br />Total Carb: 34g  11% DV<br /> SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g<br />Protein: 0g  0% DV<br /><br />Then separately listed:<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.<br /><br />Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as ""Carb"" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.<br /><br />As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):<br />Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).<br /><br />Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].<br /><br />Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.<br /><br />That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.<br /><br />But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?","At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For",1

So I placed my order.<br /><br />I received my shipment last night and I only received 1 box of 16oz oat bran and then when I logged onto my account and checked I see that the decription had been changed to state it was for only one box with a unit price of 10.22.<br /><br />I will be returning this box ASAP since I can buy this same product locally for half the price.<br /><br />Bad, bad business practices. I will leave a bad review for Hoosier Farms everywhere I can.  If they had personally responded to my original email this could have been avoided","Big rip-off, do not buy from Hoosier Farms",1

Upon inspecting the jerky, I found that several pieces contained mold on them.  What I have now is over a half pound of very expensive dog treats.

"this product was a suckarooney. i really looked forward to it because it's unusual, and sounded yummy. WRONG. i mixed it as instructed, using milk instead of water as directed to make it lighter. it comes with a small jar of huckleberry jam, that is to be mixed into the batter. it was interesting, so i did it. the batter was thick and lumpy, even after mixing well. the instructions said it would be, if done correctly. when i poured the batter, it kind of ""blopped"" onto the griddle. each pancake took a while to cook, but i was patient. each cake was very HEAVY and cakey. it literally stuck to the roof of my mouth. the lumps exploded into bursts of mix in my mouth. the flavor did taste like huckleberry, but still had a packaged, jammy flavor. i really hated it, as did my husband. his response was, ""what the **** is this mess? i hope you didn't pay much for it!"" unfortnately, it's very expensive, and NOT WORTH IT. i have all the other jam, jelly, and syrup products from ""wild wilderness"", and i have been very pleased at the delicious, fresh flavors. but this one was a dud. you would do better to use your usual mix or recipe, and add some jam to it. don't waste your money on this.",huckleberry flapjack mix,1

After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.<br /><br />CONS - When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't break them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fibrous looking. Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.<br /><br />PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.<br /><br />Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats.

I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.,Never again,1

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product ""LaraBar"" by ""LaraBar"".

"I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel-cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal - for years.  Pallets of it.  Literally, I had bought lots of ""value pack"" 24-packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the ""new"" improved package at Stop & Shop.<br /><br />The new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible.  I couldn't finish it.  Tasted a little like coffee grounds.  Even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all.<br />How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that?  Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites?  (Why didn't Coca-Cola just release ""New Coke"" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their brand loyalty?  And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?)<br /><br />Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop brand, and it's not bad.  Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough.  Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion.  Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often.  I'll be waiting for one of those ""We heard you, and we're making it right"" commercials... Until then, it's store-brand oats for me.",Quaker has taken themselves out of the instant oats market,1

I didn't think much of it and I ended up buying one for myself (admittedly by mistake, I just wanted a regular beef stick).  They taste okay; the spiciness is interesting that it has sort of a delay but, it does seem to stick around long after the burn starts.<br /><br />However, the next day I woke up out of a deep sleep from sharp pains in my stomach and had to use the bathroom twice.  And the pains are very sharp, I had to keep clenching my stomach and I was rocking back and forth.  I feel bad that my wife had to experience this during work!<br /><br />tl;dr: Tastes okay, but the 'end result' is not worth it... unless you've been constipated for weeks and have grown desperate for a cure, you'll probably not want to experience the end results of this delicious beef stick.","Tastes okay, but the 'end result' is not worth it.",1

I have purchased other brands, from this website and from vitamin websites and they were cheap and lovely to the nose, mouth, and body.  I honestly do not know why this smells so bad.

When I got the container I found that it was no cheaper and in fact more money than some oils I have been purchasing.

"I bought this after reading the nutrition information. If it tasted good, it would be a wonderful breakfast, especially on the week-ends or you could even use it as a dinner entree because it has only 2 grams of fat/serving, 5 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein. Unfortunately this mix tastes ghastly and the texture of the pancakes is kind of ""pebbley"" and just not what I've come to expect from a pancake. Also, the pancakes are very fragile and hard to turn. If you make the mix as directed the pancakes are thick and take a very long time to get done and end up too brown. This happened even after I thinned the batter with a bit more milk.<br />And speaking of milk....with this mix you have to add milk, oil and eggs. With my regular mix, I only have to add water or milk and they taste alot better than these do.<br /><br />I thought maybe I could salvage it by mixing it with my usual brand of pancake mix but even at a 40/60 ratio (40 of this mix, 60 of my usual brand) it just tasted awful and again with the yucky texture. Since it doesn't taste sweet to me, I tried mixing it up with some spices, bread crumbs and a bit of flour and dredged a few chicken tenders through an egg and then in the mixture and then I fried them in canola oil. It was not too bad however, it wasn't good enough for me to want to keep this mix or to ever buy it again especially since I almost never fry chicken anymore. One last thing: I read that once you heat flax seed to a certain temp, it looses it's ""goodness"" so I think you probably lose that healthy aspect of this mix.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is too expensive, tastes awful and has a horrible texture.

"I love mangoes.  One of my favorite fruits.  But fresh mango is expensive in the U.S. and also seasonal. I love mango that is sweet and a teeny, tiny bit of tartness. I bought this item thinking that canned mangoes would let me have mangoes during the off-season.  But I am disappointed with this one. I agree with one reviewer that the mango is mushy.  It has been overprocessed to the point that there is no characteristic taste or flavor of mango at all. Even if you try making a milkshake out of this mango, you wouldn't recognize that it has mango flavor.  The texture is horrible.  It is better to go for the canned peaches from your local store instead (I haven't tried Roland's canned peaches). At least canned peaches have good texture and flavor. The taste of this mango is just plain, flat sweetness from the syrup. They look good but don't taste as good as they look. Somehow, they have good fresh mangoes to start with but they need to reformulate the canning process to preserve the distinctive taste and flavor of fresh mango, and while they are at it, they might as well make a no-sugar added version as well.",Look Good but Mushy,1

"We bought a case of this coconut milk based on the lack of BPA in the packaging, but we were not happy with the product.  It smells strange, is quite watery, and gave both my wife and I an upset stomach on two occasions that we tried it. (Our cans came from Sri Lanka, but weren't dented.)",Not a pleasant experience,1
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

"My four cats liked the smell of these treats but they would not eat them.<br /><br />The treat to human eyes is totally unappealing. Not only are they freeze-dried raw but they look hairy (similar to a dust bunny I would find under the bed). In size, they are the circumference and height of a double-stuffed Oreo cookie. They are also very light and as easy to break up as a wafer.<br /><br />I broke several into smaller bite-sized pieces and left them out overnight.  One of my cats looked like he was going to take a bite but eventually walked away. The other three smelled the pieces and left without even trying them.<br /><br />The box of the Chicken Formula Raw Boost Bites claims these treats are for cats and dogs and are made of chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, etc.  Each large piece is 23 calories and they recommend 1 to 2 pieces per 20 pounds of body weight.  However, since my four cats won't eat them, I'm going to throw out all this goodness to the wildlife.  Maybe some critter will eat it.",My four cats would not eat this,1
"It is appalling to read some of the misinformation on this product especially the one with the highest helpful score by Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""... Parisi has written the same review for Swanson as well as Twinlab. Twinlab has not even specified the chromium and selenium even on their Internet site and the nutritional value is not even presented clearly at all. A good Brewer's Yeast should provide the needed information not only on their Internet site but on the package labelling...<br /><br />1. Brewer's yeast does not contain vitamin B12, an essential vitamin found in meat and dairy products. Vegetarians sometimes take brewer's yeast mistakenly believing that it provides B12, which can be lacking in their diet. One tablespoon of Spirulina offers 67% vitamin B12 in comparison to 2% in brewer's yeast. Regardless, I get my B12 from sardines, sprats and salmon.<br />2. Unlike ordinary brewer's yeast, which is grown on grain and hops liquor, brewer's yeast which is called nutritional yeast is derived from the  sugar beets not hops, barley or grain.<br />3. A good brewer's yeast should be unbleached, untreated, not fortified, not blended, non GMO, nothing added and specify 100% brewer's yeast.<br />4. One tablespoon of brewer's yeast (15gr) provides me with 70% chromium and 45% selenium. I am into very healthy diet and different sports from mountain biking, surfing, weight lifting, hiking, etc. without any need for any meds for any chronic condition. Although I get selenium from Brazil Nuts, chromium is hard to get due to the depletion of the nutrients in soil. Brewer's yeast offers me other benefits like keeping glucose down, healthy skin especially when I am exposed to the sun without any sun protection since I want to get my vitamin D naturally, increasing HDL and lowering LDL, vitamin B complex and some vegetable protein.<br />5. Protein in brewer's yeast is a vegetable protein and not as complete in amino acids as the protein in dairy product like eggs, milk, cheese and yogurt. Quinoa offers me more complete protein for less money. I consume unflavored Whey Protein Isolate for weight lifting even though I consume fish and dairy products but no beef or chicken.",Do Your Research...,1

An hour later, he proceeded to throw up blood, a large amount of blood. Soon after, he threw up blood again. We rushed him to the vet, and the vet said that this product was way too hard for a puppy that young. We were surprised to hear this because the package stated that the product was designed for puppies 6 months or older, and Rocco was double the suggested weight limit. He said this product should not be given to dogs until they are more than a year old. The product, when chewed, became sharp shards, that tore up his digestive tract.

I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they ""roast"" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that ""all cacao nibs have to be roasted...""  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products.",LIARS!!!!

"The reason I purchased this product is for the ""No Sugar Added"" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains ""Sucralose"". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?",It is toooo sweet!,1

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says ""eat me, I am food"".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.

"This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.  As a result, when the K-cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k-cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!

"I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like ""THREE DOG BAKERY"" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label ""MADE IN CHINA"" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it.

I grew up drinking coconut water in Jamaica and have been getting the Vita Coco brand which is decent but not great.  I decided to try this based upon the great reviews and am VERY VERY disappointed.<br /><br />This is probably one of the nastiest things that I have ever tasted and is a very poor excuse for coconut water.

"Dogswell jerky treat come China.  They are not safe.  I've had a subscribe and save subscription for the product, but I've calcelled after reading this story from September 15, 2012.  (Just search for the article's title, which is the same as my review.)<br />----<br />The FDA now says 350 dogs and one cat have died in the last 18 months, reportedly after eating chicken jerky treats made in China.<br /><br />An FDA report released this week says they've received 2,200 reports of illnesses linked to the treats - the deaths are included in that number. There is no geographic pattern to the illnesses and deaths - cases have been reported from all 50 states and 6 Canadian provinces.<br /><br />The FDA says the majority of complaints involve chicken jerky (treats, tenders, and strips), but others include duck, sweet potato, and treats where chicken or duck jerky is wrapped around dried fruits, sweet potatoes, or yams.<br /><br />The report goes on to say that in the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in importation of pet food from China. It is estimated that nearly 86 million pounds of pet food came from China in 2011. Pet treats, including jerky pet treats, are currently considered the fastest growing segment in the pet food market.<br /><br />The FDA has been investigating the reports of illnesses, but no definitive cause has been determined.<br /><br />""The ongoing global investigation is complex, multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the FDA including toxicologists, epidemiologists, veterinary researchers, forensic chemists, microbiologists, field investigators and senior agency officials,"" the report says.<br /><br />The FDA says product samples have been tested for contaminants known to cause the symptoms and illnesses reported in pets, and they are now expanding testing to include irradiation byproducts and they are consulting with NASA experts about it.<br /><br />In their report, the FDA says jerky treats are not necessary for pets to have a balanced diet - basically advising people not to feed them to their pets. But if you choose to give your pet the treats,  watch them closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination.",FDA says pet death toll from jerky treats now at 360,1

"I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!",Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!,1

He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)

I have developed sulphur allergies over the years (you develop allergies via exposure) and with more and more mass produced bulk items containing sulphur, likely many more people will too.  I have had some pretty serious health consequences of same.<br />We can get these locally very inexpensively (I am in Hawaii) and would never purchase this particular brand because of the sulphur.  I did buy it once without thinking, and they tasted bitter, acrid, nowhere near as good as we get in local shops, health food stores.  I realize that tropical fruit is not easy to get everywhere, but there are good healthy alternatives.  Consider, for example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O3C"">Woodstock Farms Mango Slices, Unsulphured, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />i was browsing here, hoping to get better prices (and access) on bulk dried fruit, but can see that the lack of labeling info is going to cause me a problem :(  I guess my only alternative until other customers specify what is on the label, is to buy things specifically labeled ""unsulphured"".<br />If you do not have allergiews or sulphur related health problems (yet) maybe consider comparing the 2.  Sulphured fruit is bitter, leaves a chemical aftertaste and is overdried making it taste a lot less fresh (which it generally is) and tougher.  In my experience, this particular product is the worst offender (at least that I have encountered).  It is heavvily sulphured and really tastes off.",SULPHERED!,2
"Let's get one thing straight first: dogs love this stuff. I mean they REALLY LOVE IT. Not just my puppy, but every dog in my office - the second this stuff comes out, my desk is surrounded by noses that smelled it from across the office. And they want it so bad they'll watch wistfully as my puppy devours it, just a little bit, from his Kong. When he's done, they get in line to steal the Kong and the lucky one will spend several minutes working on it just in case there's any left.<br /><br />By the end of the afternoon, I am choking on the odor that rises at regular intervals from under my desk in nearly visible clouds of pure dog fart stench. By the time we get home, even the puppy will stop in his tracks every few minutes and startle at his own rear end, not entirely sure what's going on back there but knowing it's probably not good. By the end of the evening I am swearing to myself once again that tomorrow, no matter how desperate I am to occupy him and get some work done, I won't give this stuff to the puppy and turn him into a 6.5lb tactical nuke.<br /><br />I think today was the last time he'll be getting it, and the rest of the can is going in the trash. It's just not worth it!","Oh, the gas! The horrible, horrible gas...",2

I understand that this is a Japanese assortment, but I believe the fillings lacked flavor, in particular the red bean.

First, the mushy little noodles don't taste anything like Pad Thai.  It looks and tastes like some brown gravy-ish thing, not particularly terrible but not particularly great either.  When I first opened the cup and saw less than 2 inches of noodles on the bottom, I thought, ""Wow, these things must really expand a lot to fill the cup!""  But after adding the powdered sauce packet, pouring in the boiling water, and letting it sit for about 5 minutes....nope, still about 2 inches of noodles and that was it!  Way overpriced for just under $2 per cup.  I think Dr. McDougall needs to go back to the test kitchen on this one.",This one was a disappointment,2

"This flavored chocolate confection is merely okay.<br /><br />First off, it isn't really chocolate over pomegranate seeds.  That would have been cool.  Instead it is chocolate that supposedly has the flavoring from a different confection from the same manufacturer, and that confection supposedly tastes something like pomegranate.  That stuff is mixed into dark chocolate to make this stuff.<br /><br />The dark chocolate part of this confection isn't semi-sweet, which is what I'm used to seeing for dark chocolate, instead its regular sweet, making it too sweet.<br /><br />Some of the confection appears to have that beige dimpling that occurs when chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, is exposed to the elements.  I don't know if its water, or air that does that, but this package was like that.<br /><br />Many of the small balls were stuck together into large constellations.<br /><br />All in all this confection isn't disgusting, but it hardly deserves the rank it has.  I'd say all in all its pretty 3-star average.<br /><br />EXCEPT, this treat has a fatal flaw: it doesn't taste like pomegranate.  Not even a little bit.  Nope, no trace of pomegranate flavor is perceptible.  It tastes like not-pomegranate.  And that not-pomegranate taste isn't readily identifiable.  I eat fresh pomegranates regularly, and so have an inkling of their flavor, and that pomegranate-flavor isn't contained within this chocolate confection.","Okay, Not Great",2

"I am writing this review fully acknowledging that tastes are matters of personal preference, whether in music or in food. That being said, I have to come out and say I just don't like these cashews, which are practically encrusted with salt and pepper.<br /><br />In our family we don't salt and pepper our food liberally, so maybe my wife and I were particularly sensitive to the salt-and-pepper blast of these cashews. Again, it's a matter of taste: if you love salt and pepper, you might like these.<br /><br />To write a fair review, I decided to wash the seasonings off the cashews under tap water to taste the bare nut underneath. I was surprised to find that the salt and pepper didn't just rinse off. Something was making it adhere to the cashews. So I soaked and rinsed and rubbed with my fingers a little more and finally got all the seasoning off the 5 or 6 cashews I had in my hand.<br /><br />Once I got all the seasoning off (or so I thought), I noticed something else that surprised me: the cashews were still greasy. This wasn't intended to be a whole-day affair, so I just popped two in my mouth. The first thing I noticed was that the cashew retained a slightly crisp, roasted character even after the drenching. That was the good news. Then I dropped the remaining cashews in my mouth, and a few seconds later came the bad news: I started tasting that pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop, poking its way through an otherwise tasty though plain roasted cashew.<br /><br />If you'd like a simpler review, my wife, a no-nonsense woman, ate just a couple and said, ""I hate these. Do they have those Emerald almonds with the cocoa back in stock yet?""",Pesky Little Prickly Pepper Picked for Palate Pop,2

"When looking at buying creamer, I mistakenly believed that this product would pair well with the coffee I enjoy (a cinnamon / vanilla flavored coffee).  Listed below are my opinions about said creamer when used in both normal coffee (unflavored medium roast) as well as flavored coffee.  Both types of coffee were ground that day.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The amount of creamer you receive borders on the ridiculous.  The package has to contain near 8 lbs. of creamer.<br />The creamer is individually packaged and arrives in four cartons (each containing 50 creamers).<br />The cartons are easy to open and have a flap to allow for easy access.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />The creamer is VERY weak.  To receive the same texture / coloring / flavoring as a traditional creamer (one in a bottle), you must use roughly 50% more of this creamer.<br />The vanilla taste is very minimal.<br />The cinnamon taste is very prevalent.<br />the cinnamon taste is rather repugnant and almost has a sour taste to it.<br />The individual creamers are rather hard to open (not that they are difficult to grab the flap, but there is a ton of glue used, and most often (7/10 times) will tear because the flap is glued down to heavily.<br /><br />~~~~<br /><br />In all, I would not recommend this product.  I've actually tried to give the creamer away to several people, but after tasting it, no one wants it.  Even at work, with the ~175 remaining creamers sitting there, after a week, the first container is still not empty (meaning, that of the 175 I brought, there are still more than 150 sitting there).",Poor Quality Product,2

"As other reviewers have noted, the product arrived damaged... over half the cans were dented and 3 of them badly enough to compromise the seal (lovely smell). The problem is that a dent near the top of the can causes the lid to separate along the score-line that would normally only separate when you pull the pull-top lid off. It is clear that this happened before the product reached Amazon for shipment as the light bulbs shipped in the same box suffered no ill effects (not to mention the age of the stain on the cans themselves).<br /><br />The product itself seems to be OK; it looks pretty much like the pictured product, though not all of our cats enjoyed it and it has a strong fragrance of fish even when sealed properly - was a hit with one of the cats, not so much the others. For a product at this price point, and at the relative rate of damage noted in other reviews, this is not something I will buy again as I am now concerned that I may have missed a slightly damaged seal and would not want to risk feeding my (spoiled) animals a spoiled product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer is reading this, my first thoughts would be jams at case conveyor transitions, low back-pressure conveyor failure, palletizer/wrapper problems or rough forklift handling.

The idea of it is good, French Roast is usually sweet and tasty. This has this bitter undertone, not sure if that has something to do with the removeal of acidic properties. Also it's pretty expensive for it not to taste like a fine brewed coffee. Overall I don't think I could pay for this, even though I like the idea of a less acidic Coffee. Maybe if they could lose the bitter taste, but after two pots of it that taste is prominent. So a no go for me.",Bitter aftertaste,2
"I was really rooting for this toy to work out, because my Frenchie Tobias loves playing with plastic bottles and he loves treats. The Tug a jug should be the perfect combo, right? The one I purchased had the rope, not the rubber thing. In theory, when you tip the toy treats should fall out relatively easily, according to various instructions and videos I found through internet searches. But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.<br /><br />He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.<br /><br />I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part.

The consistency this time was VERY runny and watered down... In fact, I ended up spilling some of the first bottle as I wasn't expecting it to be so watery.

Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me.

"I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...] Needless to say I'm switching to another brand.<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",Read this article first,2
"As with anything, one cat's trash is another cat's treasure (or something like that).  I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.

More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken. Next time I'll try Strawberries & Cream and see if it's still awesome.",What happened???,2

They were quick to respond to my concern, and sent another item to ensure that the sprinkles would make it in time for my daughter's birthday.  But here is my concern (and it is a big one!) - the sprinkles came in an unsealed, unlabeled jar that just had a slip of paper with the ingredients hastily scotch taped to the bottle.  I now see that this was also the case with another reviewer's item.  I will not be willing to use these sprinkles - even though they are exactly what I was expecting and wanted - because I have no idea where they came from or who has had contact with them!  I am not willing to give these to a group of toddlers and their parents.  So basically I paid for something that I will not be using.  And if I attempt to return them to the seller, will they just resell them to another person without knowing if I could have opened the item and touched them?  This is just nasty.  I am very disappointed, especially since it is too late to order something similar to this for my daughter's party.",Item is great but very concerned. . . .,2

"I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried.","Astringent, weak tea",2
"I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated.

"This review applies both to the ""Chipotle"" and the ""Spicy Ranchero"" flavors, neither of which tastes much like anything identifiable. The base is a thin mayonnaise made from soybean oil, chemically dyed to vivid and rather odd colors. To that are added various natural and artificial flavors to create a strong, though only moderately spicy, flavor.<br /><br />This isn't really a sauce and it isn't very Mexican. What it is is the sort of bright-color/strong-flavor condiment that kids like to squirt over everything. Juvenile palates are evidently what it's intended for.

"I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.

I'm sure it's an acquired taste but I don't think I'll ever get used to it. Even an hour later I could still taste it faintly and I keep shuddering lol. My 4 year old wants to eat the whole box.

"Pros:<br /><br />The popcorn tastes the same as it always has. Good.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The plastic pop-up bowl packaging doesn't work very well. It's difficult to open. If you're not careful you'll end up spilling the popcorn all over the place while trying to open the bag. You might also burn yourself.<br /><br />I know some people like to eat out of the bag, and if you do you will find this experience quite messy. The plastic portion of the bag does not soak up the oil like a traditional paper bag, so it gets all over your hands.<br /><br />After popping 4 bags in 2 different microwaves, I have come to the conclusion that these new bags simply do not pop as well as the old ones. I have more unpopped kernels, and visibly less popcorn when I pour it out into a separate bowl to eat (which I prefer). And 1 of the 4 bags leaked some oil into the microwave.<br /><br />The new bags are smaller than the old ones; 2.69 ounces compared to 2.9 (which used to be 3.3 ounces not too long ago.) Is this new packaging really just a scheme to hide a price increase?<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />2 stars.<br /><br />Start with 4 stars for the taste; about as good as microwave popcorn gets, but not as good as homemade.

"This is a really nice dessert tea. It is reminds me of Celestial Seasonings' ""Vanilla Hazelnut"", but with a much stronger nut bouquet and flavor. It also has a very strong caramel type smell.<br /><br />Since I wanted a more authentic chai flavor, this particular tea does not ""pass muster"". My first thought upon smelling this was ""does this have chicory in it?"" It could also have the roasted carob found in the vanilla hazelnut tea mentioned above, but chicory is more likely. It should not be advertised as chai.<br /><br />Currently I brew two different chais together (Tazo and India Tea's Cardemom Chai) together. After that I  put the seeds of two cardamom pods, one star anise, a chunk of ginger and a little freshly ground pepper before adding milk and honey. I was hoping I could just one tea bag upon receipt of this order. I'll keep this, but my search for the perfect Chai in one bag is still on!<br /><br />This tea also seems very sweet.

Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )",Popchips vs Baked Lays?

"This is the first catnip I've bought.  It seemed the best bang for the buck at the time of purchase, especially considering the top rated brand was 1/3 the amount for the same price.  I've used it in toys, rubbed it between my fingers as the package directs, etc.; yet our three month old kitten just doesn't seem to care.  She'll ""usually"" come up and take a whiff when I open the bag or coax her to see what I've got in my hand, but she quickly loses interest.  And it never manages to put her into some euphoric state, much less even settle her down, when she's running around, going crazy, as growing, restless housecats do.<br /><br />The catnip smells mostly like ground tea leaves, to me.  The only praise I can offer regards the volume that comes in the package compared to most other offerings on amazon, and that it comes in a resealable bag - not a ""ziplock"" bag like another reviewer indicated; it's clearly a professionally packaged product, but one with a ziplock style closure.  And, as others have noted, the bag is 3oz NOT 3.5 as amazon's title erroneously misadvertises.  Even so, it's still the best value on amazon, assuming it works as well as the other, more expensive, brands.  Considering all but maybe the most expensive has received mixed reviews of effectiveness, and that the best rated/most expensive option appears to be charging more for a tin can, I'm reluctant to invest more in a product that may only be effective for certain cats, if indeed it's not another form of snake oil.  Maybe I should have done my usual research beforehand.<br /><br />Update:  Having put this in several toys, a cardboard scratching pad and even sprinkled a little on her food once or twice per week, our kitten not only shows disinterest in this product now, but practically runs away when I open the bag as if the smell actually offends her.  We have three large, cat-eating dogs outside, which we rescued her from right after they got two of her siblings - they had wondered into the dogs radio fence boundaries and got trapped inside a tractor - so she has to stay indoors.  I was really hoping this might settle her down when she gets stir crazy.  But it doesn't, not in the least.",You get what you pay for?  Or is catnip tantamount to snake oil?,2

The ingredients in this food are really not something I would normally even consider feeding to our cats, but like I said, I was freaking out! Usually cats like crappy canned food, so I figured, what the hell and opened a can. Not only did our chronic renal failure cat turn his nose up, but so did the other 3 cats. Oh, well! I'm sure it's better than any of Hill's Science Diet products, Purina anything, or Royal Canin's prescription diet, but not by very much.","Our cat doesn't like this food, and the ingredients are very iffy",2

"The biggest differences I've noticed between these cups and the traditional plastic K-Cup are (a) they seem to leave a little more sediment in the bottom of the cup, and (b) they produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam floating on the top of a good cup of coffee - than most other K-Cup products.  So far, only the ""Extra Bold"" varieties of traditional K-Cups have come anywhere near the amount of crema generated by these babies.<br /><br />But crema doesn't make up for lack of flavor, and I thought this variety was on the weak and watery side.  It's more like Maxwell House or Folgers than a real gourmet blend - color me distinctly unimpressed.  I found the French Roast variety grew on me, and the slightly ""off"" taste I thought I noticed at first didn't really bother me by the time I got to the end of the last bag.  But these I'm having to almost force myself to drink.  I didn't think I'd be buying the French Roast again when I first tasted it, but I've changed my mind.  This stuff I'm definitely NEVER buying again - in fact, I'm thinking about taking the last two bags into the office and leaving them by the Keurig for my co-workers to sample rather than drinking them myself - I dislike them that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I worked briefly for the company that makes these in the late '70s.  Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it.  Couldn't swing that with this stuff - I didn't care much for it at all.","No, they're not traditional K-Cups, but they work fine",2

That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.

"I have three dogs a ten year old Mini Dachshund, a 1.5 year old boxer, and a one year old hound mix.  I wanted to LOVE this food because of all the great reviews and how healthy it seemed.  I loved that it had bits and pieces of peas, carrots, bananas.  My dogs seemed to really enjoy the food and ate a lot of it, BUT... my boxer developed TERRIBLE smelling gas.  I mean, enough to clear the room.  Some nights I had to sleep in my daughter's room because it was so bad it would wake me up from a dead sleep.  My dachshund started to develop really bad breath, which can be common in small dogs as they get older, but her breath had no smell before being on this food.  My hound mix's hair started to thin and fall out around the base of her tail.  It just seemed too coincidental to start having problems with all three of my dogs after starting this food.<br /><br />So we switched back to Eukanuba Adult dog food after trying out the C&P Ultramix for about three or for months and ALL of the problems have disappeared.  Well, the dachshund's breath is still a little funny but NO WHERE near as bad as it was.  The boxer still has gas, but it is back to the point to where I only hear it... I don't smell it.  And my hound mix's hair looks good again.<br /><br />Do I think this food is terrible?  No, it seems to work for a lot of people and their dogs.  It just didn't work for us.  I wish it did.  The auto delivery option was so convenient, great service.  It just wasn't for my dogs, I guess.",Wish we could love this food.,2

"Recently, I've been searching for a good ginger tea.  Preferably, something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger.  Well, I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag.  However, once you brew it (and I let it steep a long time) you can't even taste any of the ginger.  What happened to all the spiciness?  I don't know, but it doesn't make a good ginger tea.  Furthermore, it doesn't even taste good otherwise, as it is really bland in flavor.<br /><br />I suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea, and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but cannot stand its taste.  Personally, though, I was really let down by this tea, hence the 2-star rating.<br /><br />I discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root.  This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness, and is a whole lot cheaper.  So, if you are searching for spicy ginger tea, just use a fresh root and skip expensive dried teas all together.",Not good for those who actually like the taste of ginger...,2

"I had high hopes for this cereal, as I am a big peanut fan.  However, while the cereal itself is ""not bad"" it's lacking in many areas.<br /><br />First and foremost it's not made with whole grains like Honey Nut Cheerios is.  Another reviewer put it nicely when they said this is equivalent to eating candy for breakfast.  The amount of sugar and refined carbohydrates is way too much for any type of health benefit whatsoever.  The peanuts are so small and in such small pieces (more like granules) that I don't consider them anywhere near enough to consider any health benefits from the nuts.<br /><br />The taste itself is good, and it's a bit softer of a crunch than most cereals, but outside of that it's just too many carbohydrates to be on the breakfast table.  Kellog's could really improve this cereal by getting rid of some of the added sweetners and switch to a whole grain recipe.  Until then, if you like sweet cereals with little health benefits then this is for you -- but otherwise, stick with Honey Nut Cheerios.",Honey Nut Cheerios Want-to-Be,2

"I purchased this $49.99 Gingerbread house kit at the deeply discounted price of $19.99.  I wish I had not paid more than $10.  When it arrived, it was broken in several places, and the candy canes were smashed.  I realize anything can happen during shipping, but it could have been packaged more safely. In addition, the house was much smaller than I had expected for the price. The sides of the house are no larger than graham crackers at the most. The biggest issue I had was with the icing.  The instructions say to knead it to soften it for use. I kneaded, and kneaded, and finally resorted to running it under hot water to try to get it soft enough to use.  Every few minutes I would have to run under hot water again, or else the icing would be way too hard to be able to squeeze.  There is not nearly enough icing included in order to decorate the house as it is shown in the picture.  My son and I made our own patterns as best we could, and ended up laughing about it and simply eating the house unfinished.  We had an enjoyable time, but that was due to our laughter at how horrible this kit was.  I would not recommend this kit.

"I purchased this shampoo at a local big box retailer. I had high hopes for this product as a ""normal"" shampoo (aka NOT Head and Shoulders) that would also mitigate symptoms of dry scalp (though this is not the dandruff formula, it does contain zinc pyrithione, which is the active ingredient in dandruff shampoos).<br /><br />Overall, I have been disappointed in this product. Most egregiously, it makes my hair stringy and very flat--the opposite of the volumizing effects it claimed to offer. In addition, it only did a passable--not great--job at keeping my scalp moisturized. I suppose perhaps the specific anti-dandruff formula does better with that, but since this shampoo claims to promote hair AND scalp health, I expected better. Finally, as ofther reviewers have mentioned, the product can get gloppy; the bottle gets blocked up pretty frequently, even though I'm careful not to leave it open or spill any shampoo around the opening.<br /><br />I gave two stars because the shampoo does have a pleasant smell and a nice lather.

One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 packets in a box, that gives you 4, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.",Not worth it!,2

Looking more closely at the ingredients, I noticed that it contains maltitol, which is a ""sugar alcohol."" The maltitol in the product contributes 11 grams of carbs to each bar (for a total of 24 grams of carbs).<br /><br />I've read that if you're on a low-carb diet, maltitol should probably be avoided, because it is a carb, and it does have an effect on blood sugar.<br /><br />Also, maltitol can cause intestinal discomfort and/or diarrhea, if you're sensitive to it, or eat too much of it.<br /><br />I have switched to Greens+ High Protein bars (peanut butter flavor), which are fairly low glycemic for this type of product but do not have artificials sweeteners or maltitol.

And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things...",Eh...,2
Product but finishing very bad,Good,2
"I drink this coffee like crack when in Europe and always manage to bring a couple jars back with me. For instant coffee, the taste is superb - you don't want to drink anything else, but I can't justify paying this much for one small jar of instant coffee.<br /><br />Completely agree with SoldierMan's review - the taste deserves 5 stars, and if you happen to find them while outside of the States, it probably would be cheaper to just buy a bunch and ship them back to yourself!<br /><br />For the time being, I'll hold myself over with 2 pack of the ground version from Amazon and see how that compares ($20 for a total of 17.6 oz - about 500 grams), because my husband and I are seriously in withdrawal for that coffee. Time to break out the coffee press! Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />Kraft owns this brand, you'd think they would release it in the States, too. :(","Amazing coffee, ridiculous price.",2
"I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.",Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!,2

"I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.",useless - I feel no effects whatsoever,2
"I saw these at a local health food shop and decided to give it a try since I wanted a dairy free chocolate bar.  You certainly get the dark chocolate - very strong and bitter. I knew coconut was in there from the label, and from the shreds of it I could see in the bar but I really did not taste any coconut - the chocolate flavor overpowered it completely.  The label says it contains almonds, but you don't taste that either.  I was hoping for more of a harmonious blend of both chocolate and coconut.  It certainly isn't sweet either.",Very strong chocolate flavor,2

"I bought a case of Merrick Surf & Turf with high hopes for my clutter of nine cats.  Alas, the hype didn't live up to the reality.  The product is essentially a wasted purchase, as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff.  I'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry.<br /><br />The ingredient list drew me to the product, being grain-free, and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood, plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler.  Upon opening the can, it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high, with little seafood scent detectable.  It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.  Have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff, and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them.<br /><br />I realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything, but when none of my nine will touch the stuff, I can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi-finicky cat, as a number of my gang will eat most anything, and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye-popping.  If you're cat is very picky, but you know s/he likes beef, then this flavor will probably appeal to him/her, but otherwise, I wouldn't spend your hard-earned moolah on this stuff.  Save your money and your frustration.<br /><br />I give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list; I'd otherwise give it only one star.","Great ingredient list, poor real-life performance with my taste-test panel",2

"I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.","Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter",2
"In the last year or so I've really developed a taste for dark chocolate. I've liked dark chocolate for years but I started eating a bit more recently. I've tried several different brands from the store. All were at least good with some being a little better than others.<br /><br />So. While not scientific my personal taste experience says this dark chocolate bar taste terrible.<br /><br />If you are looking for that silky smooth deep rich dark chocolate flavor that sort of infuses your whole body starting with the tongue and culminating in a very pleasing feeling in your nogging look elsewhere. My God.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are really into organics and go out of your way to eat all things organic then perhaps this is your chocolate bar. 54% is not a very dark bar and I think it shows in the taste of this bar. The taste could also be due to the organic nature of the bar. That being the case, if you prefer that organic experience, that taste that organics typically have I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For everyone else, the flavor is off with strange undertones. Not inedible just not very tasty.<br /><br />The bars are fairly small at 2.25 ounces. That isn't really a knock since moderation in all things is a good habit.",Pretty dang bad,2

"I bought some of this and tried several packets. I wanted to like it, I really did. But like all of the aspartame-based sweeteners like Equal and Nutra-sweet, stevia is bitter.  Truvia gets 2 stars because it is markedly less bitter than the others but still not sweet like sugar. The rest of the fake sugars get no stars and some are so bad as to owe stars back, like negative stars.<br /><br />I am probably very sensitive to it but so are many others. So if you find artificial sweeteners bitter, then Truvia will be bitter as well. But splitting it with sugar helps somewhat. The only thing that tastes like cane sugar is cane sugar - or beet sugar or whatever but a non-artificial sweetener.",Better than most - but not great,2

"Wow.  What a disappointment.  My son and I loved the Dairy Free Shells and Chreese, so I had high hopes for this alfredo sauce packet.  I thought it would be nice for a more grown up meal than the kid's mac version.  The first turn off (and again, totally different than the shells packet) was the aweful color. I've been a vegetarian for 25 years and a vegan for most of that, so I have a pretty high tolerance for these things.  The color was a very unappetizing greyish green, like sliced avocado that's been left out too long.  The smell and texture weren't very appealing either.  My husband will eat anything, he's a human garbage disposal, so he had no trouble with it.  But I doctored it up with some sauteed mushrooms, olive oil and a little almond milk for creamyness and it was a passable sauce on top of pasta.  But I was looking for a no fuss packet and ended up having to get creative and work with it.  I spared my son from having to eat it and opened a jar of marinara sauce for him.  I guess I'll use the rest of the packets as a thickening ingredient in sauces because they certainly aren't edible acording to the package instructions.",Not as good as the Dairy Free Shells and Chreese,2

It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me.

"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.<br /><br />White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.<br /><br />As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.<br /><br />I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins).",powder instead of leaf,2

"To give a bit of credit the side of the bag explains that the coffee is a dark roast flavored with burnt sugar, licorice root, orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg - not quite the delicious buttery caramel that they picture on the front. I feel it's deceiving though - the coffee looks unusually dark, has a strange chemical smell [perhaps from the licorice, but I love licorice and this smells like a solvent] and a noticeably bad aftertaste. Even with extra cream. For the eight bucks I paid in-store I'd rather have bought some Folgers and a bag of Werthers caramels to mix in - would have been a better value.","Strange Color, Smells Weird, Bad Aftertaste",2

"I purchased based on reviews here and elsewhere about all the wonderful things these chews accomplished on dogs teeth and the price per unit was so much less than the ""Greenies"" I have been using. Upon receipt I immediately noticed that these are just large rawhide strips with a coating on them. They are not even particularly thick rawhide. Rawhide in any form is very dangerous and you must monitor your dog very closely when they are chewing on these. My Great Dane is not a ""swallow whole"" kind of eater - he tries to chew up even the tiniest training treats before swallowing them, BUT with rawhide strips like these he will chew on the whole piece until it eventually becomes soft, then swallow it. Whole. Then choke it back up, chew some more and swallow it whole again. Repeat until it goes down and stays down. This is not healthy and not very safe and I always have to be poised to remove the offending chunk of soft wet rawhide from his throat as he gags it up. He does love these chews but I have not seen any wonderful changes in his teeth so far with 2 weeks of daily use so it will not be worth the trouble or risk of choking for me to buy more once this bag is gone. I now wish I had gotten the smaller quantity bag so I could be done with these sooner!<br />Edited to add that I finally finished the whole bag and still didnt see any big changes to his teeth or gums. Also, the coating comes off on his white legs and my carpet and they make his breath smell weird (not fresh, kind of medicine like).

"Okay, this is going to sound really strange because I loved this tea.<br /><br />I met some friends for tea at a quaint little place nearby.  I can't do caffeine so I decided to try the Two Leaves and a Bud African Sunset Red Tea because I like rooibos tea and figured I couldn't go wrong.  I really enjoyed it so asked the woman if I could see the box--I wanted to know what was in it other than rooibos. She brought the box to me and I saw that there was lemongrass in it.  That's what made it even better (for my tastebuds).<br /><br />I decided to buy the box of tea (I think there were 10 bags in the box).  When I went up to the counter, the woman told me it was $15!!!  I was shocked but had already given her my money and decided to proceed with the purchase.  When I got home I immediately went onto Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper.  Of course!!  So I bought the 100 Count box.  You're probably wondering why I'm giving this a low rating after the rave comments so far.  Here's where it gets tricky.<br /><br />The tea from the small 10-bag box was just as good as the one I had in the tea shop. However, the ones in the large quantity box just never tasted the same.  They lacked flavor, even if I steeped the bags longer.  I wonder if they're old?  I have no idea.  But I won't buy the 100 bag box again.  Sure they were way cheaper, but I'm not enjoying the tea as much.  Just drinking it to use it up and giving several bags away to friends.",I liked it in the tea shop but ...,2

"As someone who enjoys eating fish and sardines, I was very disappointed in these sardines.  I have tried most brands of sardines and eat about 5-6 cans of sardines a week.  These sardines were extremely salty and the fish had a slightly off taste to them.  The sardines were almost as salty as anchovies.  I looked at the sodium content and noticed that it was same as some other tins of sardines that I had on the shelf but for some reason these were much more saltier than the other cans.<br /><br />I tried two tins thinking that it could have been a tin of sardines that were over salted.  The can was also difficult to open but I've noticed this problem with other sardines from Portugal.  A difficult can does not bother me as long as the sardines are worth the effort to get the can open.<br /><br />I had read a review online about these sardines and wanted to try them.  I usually do not write reviews but wanted to warn others.  I would suggest buying one can and trying it before buying anymore.<br /><br />One of my favorite sardines for the price is the Matiz Gallego Sardines in Olive Oil [...]  The Matiz sardines are nice and plump and have an excellent flavor with great texture.  The quality to price is excellent for these sardines.<br /><br />Da Morgada sardines are my favorite as this current time, but Amazon does not carry these and they are expensive at other online retailers.

The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected.

"I bought a BIG jar of this coffee from the local Tesco store the last time I was visiting home in the UK. It cost about 5 GBP. When I ran out I wanted to replace it and found this listing on Amazon. Notice there is NO information  about the size of the jar. The only clues are the whopping great price tag ($15.49), the insane amount for delivery ($6.45) and the shipping weight (1.2 lbs). I reasonably expected this to be the big size based on that information. WRONG!<br /><br />I received my order very quickly, it was well packaged and the coffee IS pretty good.

"I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself.","Decent taste, cheap meat",2

"I purchased a bunch of easy and quick microwave meals that I could take with me to work for lunch without the need for a refrigerator. This appeared to fit the bill, so I bought a six-pack!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy cooking - Very easy to cook, finished in under four minutes, and requires no additional materials (except about a cup of water).<br />2) healthy - is fairly healthy (all things considered).<br />3) Contains meat - this is a debatable pro, however I've found it difficult to actually find microwave meals (that require no refrigerator/freezer) that contain meat. This does, although not very much...<br />4) Acceptable serving size - given that the base of the dish is rice, the serving size is acceptable for a light lunch. I certainly feel full for most of the afternoon if I eat this meal with an extra snack during my lunch hour.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) low-average flavor/taste - I've definitely had better microwave meals (even microwave easy mac beats this). I usually love sweet and sour, but this flavor profile tastes more like an artificial pineapple flavor fused with minute-rice. I will not be re-purchasing this item solely based on it's poor execution of flavor.<br />2) Uneven rice texture - The base of this dish is quick-cook rice, and the method that Healthy Choice chose was basically rehydration of cooked rice in a microwave. The result is unevenly cooked rice with either too firm or too soft texture.<br />3) Very sparse serving of veggies/meat - despite the fact that this meal contains veggies/meat, the size of the serving is very sparse. Whether it was to cut production cost or to cut caloric cost, the result is a very meager portion of flavored rice with bits of processed chicken/veggies.<br /><br />All-in-all, this meal has some pros that I was really looking for in no-fridge/to-go meals, but the cons just outweigh them too much.

Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.",Bubble liquid,2

"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.","Tastes good, at least",2

"The quick way to evaluate any dog food is to look at the first ingredients in ingredients list.

This is not a good list. Beef will shrink and lose its water after cooking. Soybean meal and soy flour boost the protein level, but provide less quality to this food than would actual meet. Animal fat could be any sort of gross restaurant or slaughterhouse leavings, according to the DogFoodAdvisor website.

Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy.

"I didn't like these.<br />I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.<br /><br />Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol.",I Didn't Know,2

"One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered.",This coffee is now DECAFF!,2

"EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either.",Dog goes crazy for these,2

"I thought I dreamed these up until on a whim I did a search online and found out they were real, so I ordered them through Amazon. Two days later they arrived. They are a bit small. They are like Rice Krispie treats, in that they are a block of cereal held together by sticky ""marshmallow"". They are tasty, but there is this smell that is terrible about them. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the ""marshmallow"". Whatever it is, I had to put the wrapper on the bar while I ate it because I didn't want my hand to smell from holding it. I thought maybe I got a bad batch, but I found a friend who found them in a store and tried them and said the same thing about the smell. You don't really taste the smell unless you inhale with your mouth while you have a bite of the bar in it. It's too bad because they would have been a treat I would have purchased more of.","Tasty, But So Smelly",2
"OK truth is, I do believe these help somewhat because I will be needing to go to the bathroom more and I WILL be sweating a lot more during my work outs.  But one flaw that it looks like some disagree with me on.  The taste is bloody awful!<br /><br />Let me say I am addicted to soda.... REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon/lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.  But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.  They all taste awful to me and they give me a reason to keep going with my diet so i never have to consider drinking these again.<br /><br />So yeah they help, but the worst tasting drink ever in my opinion.",Do I think they help? Yes.,2

"I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the ""natural"" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the ""natural"" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.

"I'm always looking for new and wonderful things to feed my dog, so when I saw the Cesar's Prime Rib treats, I thought ""Bingo!"" After all, they love the Cesars food. However, the treats are far from gourmet as the packaging, price, and picture would suggest. In fact, they're really no different than the run-of-the-mill soft dog treats that you can buy for half the price. One thing I always loved about the Cesars line is that their dog food actually smells palatable. It doesn't just have a meat-like aroma but a meaty aroma...a big difference. The same difference in quality can't be found in the treats though. Upon opening, I was at once overcome by a strong, acrid and chemical-like aroma. Upon examining the treat up-close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it.

"first off, the size of the box this bar of chocolate arrived in was ridiculous. it could have fit at least 50 bars or more. c'mon, amazon, you can do better.<br /><br />now to the real review, which i should qualify by saying i prefer my chocolate 70% dark. this is only 54%, which i failed to notice when i requested this vine product. that said, this tasted too much like milk chocolate. milk chocolate in a bland, mass-produced, thoughtless way. this is just boring chocolate. it's ersatz chocolate. basically, once you've gone dark, you can't go back. and this, for me, was back.","i love your movies, paul, but not your dark chocolate",2

"May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought!

"Mark Twain once said, ""The difference between the almost right word & the right word is really a large matter--it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning.""<br /><br />This quote came to mind when I first tasted Newton's Fruit Thins, which are trying to ride the name recognition of Fig Newtons.  Don't be fooled.  The difference between Nabisco's Newton Fruit Thins and the hallowed Fig Newton itself is of lightning bug/ lightning proportions.  The Fig and Honey Newton Fruit Thin is not only thin, but pale by comparison, especially if you like the taste of moist figs such as the old-school Fig Newton provides.  THIS cookie is as dry as an animal cracker, if somewhat sweeter.  It is advertised as containing raisins (which I like) and figs (which I also enjoy), but they amount to mere flecks in the cracker -- too little fruit to impact taste and just enough fruit to get caught between your teeth (they were a bit hard and dry).<br /><br />Nabisco tries mightily, trumpeting the lack of high fructose corn syrup (this product uses old-fashioned sugar instead) and the fact that it provides 8 grams of whole grain per three cookies (for those taking notes, that's 2 g. dietary fiber and 140 calories with 5g of it from fat).  Trumpet away.  When I eat a cookie, I'm being willfully bad; and if I'm being willfully bad, I want to REALLY enjoy the taste of my cookie, calories be damned.  Using that as a barometer, this cookie scores a 2-star rating at best.",Newton in Name Only,2

Well, if mozzarella were dry, crispy, and charged with a faint chemical aftertaste, then I would say, sure. Kinda. I guess. But no, they do not taste like mozzarella in the way that regular Cheez-its taste like cheddar. I think this is because cheddar at its best is dry, sharp, and a little grainy.

"I have come to expect Illy coffee to symbolize good and consistent quality. I do prefer other brands of espresso, but Illy's consistency is great since it is to be found in many restaurants around the globe.<br /><br />So it is with some sadness that I write a negative review. First off - please note that this is actually a coffee flavored energy beverage made and packaged by Coca Cola. Illy has partnered in order to take proceeds by allowing their name to be used. There might be a some of their coffee used, but it would be processed coffee extract, and so there wouldn't be much reason to use expensive Arabica coffee when extract from lower quality Robusto would work.<br /><br />This canned beverage seems to taste pleasant enough at first, but then it starts to turn metallic. The coffee flavor really is a 'coffee flavor'. There is just something artificial and chemical tasting about this drink. Granted, it's only 45 calories, most coming from the beet extract sweetener.  And don't be fooled by beet sweetener, it's really no different than any other unbleached sugar.  It is regularly used to Chaptalize wine in fact.  Don't be lured in by the low calorie claim: fresh brewed iced coffee without sweetener? Zero calories. Yes. Zero. (okay, actually 0.01 calories! sorry!) So it's not like they're really doing anything crazy by offering this at 45 calories.  It's just less sugar added than the super sweet beverages.  Really it seems the sweetener was added to try and mask the artificial and metallic flavor.<br /><br />There are better iced coffees on the market.  I hope we really start to see some more variety and availability soon.  Other countries like Japan have a huge market for bottled and canned unsweetened tea and coffee, so hopefully we can get on the bandwagon soon.  Hopefully with better tasting results.","An ""Energy Beverage"" canned by Coca Cola - It's not good",2

"They claim this product is ""unadulterated"", which would make you think ""oh! sweet! it's going to be the BEST, because nobody else's coconut oil says it's ""unadulterated"".  I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils.

I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people.

There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier.

"I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.

Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.

"I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me.

"When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture).  I looked at the label - it says: ""feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight"".  So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight.  Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended.  But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal.  So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal.  The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15).  In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day.  So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet).  That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand.  I think this product is overpriced and cat owners need to be aware of the calorie content in Weruva's canned cat food, so that they won't underfeed their pets with insufficient amount of calorie.",Healthy but extremely low calorie per can (be careful not to underfeed your cat),2

"I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I like granola, but I don't really get to eat it a lot, due the high carb nature of all granola.  I also like chocolate, ok I love chocolate.<br /><br />I thought this might be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />I first tried it in cold milk as cereal.  The granola is typical granola.  Lots of chewing, so so taste.  On top of that was the chocolate.  Something about the chocolate and the milk made the chocolate taste practically overwhelm the granola.  Not bad, just not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I next tried it as a dry snack.  Except for the mess of eating granola without a spoon and some milk to hold it in place, this was better.  The chocolate taste was a little more subtle, basically coming in the bites that had chocolate.  Plus with it being dark chocolate, it's not overwhelming.<br /><br />Back to Nature products are expensive.  That's what you get when you go with a small company who is actually producing less processed products.  This isnt' that important to me, but it could be important to you.<br /><br />As some others here have suggested, the idea is a good one.  Maybe having a bag of chocolate chips that you love mixed with a bag of granola that you love, and coming up with a good ratio would make for a wonderful snack (or even a wonderful breakfast) but to me this isn't it.",Generic,2

"As my baby approaches the stage at which we can introduce solids to her diet, I started doing my research on organic, prepared baby foods.  I was all set to make Earth's Best my brand of choice, since we already use some of their other products (e.g., baby wipes).  But that was until I discovered that the covers of their glass jars contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor that can cause negative health effects, especially in vulnerable infants and young children.  Apparently, Earth's Best claims that its jarred baby food has been independently-tested, and found to have undetectable levels of BPA.  However, I'm still skeptical.  In a ""perfect lab"" setting with a pristine jar of baby food, the BPA may not have had the opportunity to leach from the cover into the baby food.  But in the real world, by the time that jar of baby food reaches the average consumer, it has been turned upside-down and shaken up in the process of packing, shipping, unpacking, shelving, etc.  Plus, many parents warm up their baby food in the jars; and I've heard that heating can increase/speed-up the BPA leaching process.  SCARY STUFF!!  I don't see why Earth's Best doesn't just play it safe and line their baby food jar covers with a resin that doesn't contain BPA.  It's honestly not that hard to do ... Just ask Eden Organics!  The linings of many of their canned vegetables are BPA-free.  Sure, it might increase the cost of the baby food by a bit, but I'm sure I speak for many parents when I say that I'd be willing to pay a little extra just for the peace of mind of knowing that there are no harmful chemicals in my baby's food.  After all, we're willing to spend a bit more for organic baby food to begin with.<br /><br />Earth's Best also makes baby food in BPA-free pouches.  But, to be honest, the company's refusal to acknowledge and correct the problem of BPA in its jar covers has left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).

I did order these together with back to nature's salted and roasted almonds and those were very good.

"It's hard to find a good quality whole leaf tea in bags, and the great reviews this brand received were pretty convincing. So I gave it a shot, in spite of my usual preference for organic or fair trade teas. Sadly, there is an unpleasantly strong perfumey odor and taste to this Earl Grey and when I looked at the ingredients, the reason was quite clear. It is comprised of whole leaf black tea along with natural and ARTIFICIAL flavors. Why the artificial flavors? Isn't a top quality oil of bergamot enough? It is for me. Unfortunately, grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon, so I'm stuck with three tins of tea that I will probably never drink.",Artificial flavors? Seriously?,2

"The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.","Roller Jams, Wasted Product",2
"I am surprised to be writing that I am disappointed in a Pamela's product having always been a fan.  When the frostings came out I was excited to have a convenient source of frosting in a pinch.

"There is nothing better to me than a nice homemade chili. It does take some time to make however so I decided to look for a good canned chili to have on hand when I needed a quick fix and didn't have time to make from scratch. I chose this chili because I like a spicy chili and was drawn to the habanero peppers.<br />First of all, there is no way there are habanero peppers in this chili. I was shocked when I took my first bite and there was almost no heat at all. So the dynamite hot label is extremely misleading. On a heat scale of 1 to 10, I would honestly give this a 1 or 2 tops.<br />The chili also has a strange greasy taste and feel in your mouth when you eat it. After adding hot sauce and cheese,it was not so bad when eaten with tortilla chips. I will eat the other 5 cans doing the same thing but will not eat it out of the can as is.<br />In conclusion, I give it 2 stars because it is edible but not very enjoyable.

"After reading the reviews on Amazon and researching food ideas online I got some friends together and we all divulged.  Out of the seven of us who took it, three of us just felt sick after the process.  All of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us, they were not necessarily good tricks.  I wouldn't say sour things tasted sweet for instance, I would say they tasted weird kind of like lychees but not very good ones.  The only thing I tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a Coors light.  It tasted like a pretty good Pilsner after the pill, and everyone seemed to like this, but sometimes a nice cold Coors light is just what you need, so...

"The first problem I had with this shampoo, was expecting to see something CLEAR poured into my hand, given the name of it. When it came out a pinkish opaque I should have known that was only the beginning. But I proceeded to use it anyway and was sorely disappointed to the point of all out frustration, perhaps anger. I have very long hair, almost to my waist, and it's always been fine/limp, so seeing that this shampoo says VOLUMIZING, I expected it to do that. Instead it went on like conditioner without having used shampoo, and ultimately it felt like I gave my hair an oil bath. I actually had so much oily residue (or whatever that was!) as a result of using this, that I had to wash my hair again with GOOD shampoo (Pantene), to get that stuff off my hair. But in the meantime, while assessing the consequences of using ""CLEAR"", I found my hair to have zero body or fullness, and it was nearly impossible to get dry, or maybe it did get dry and felt so oily I couldn't tell. Either way, I absolutely hated it. I have been wondering what they were thinking, making a product like this. And as for it being opaque instead of clear, I find that odd, because every other volumizing shampoo I use (Pantene, Dove, Suave, etc) comes out clear and yet does not use that as their claim to fame.<br />Regardless of that, I very generously gave this 2 stars because I am assuming my hair type must be at least partly to blame for my bad experience. I would hope this shampoo is useful for someone that has excessively dry or ""wiry"" hair who needs the deepest conditioning to tame it or soften it.",Might be good for others but NOT ME!,2

"66g of sugar in the form of High Fructose Corn Syrup. 260 calories (in the form of sugar carbs). 174mg caffeine. A smattering of vitamins. Yes it will keep you awake. And yes you will inevitably crash from it. (I did.) It does taste better than red bull and about the same as Rock Star. But seriously, 2 of these day as some people reported seems to be putting you on track for health problems. And why in the world does an energy drink need a skull on the front? I downed my can before doing an MMA session. The guys in my class were not extra intimidated when they saw the skull. (Bummer.) I did not have any greater than usual work out ability. Time did not slow down. UFC fighters and BJJ black belts did not run away in fear.<br /><br />This really isnt a bad drink, I was just hoping for something different or better or healthier than EVERY OTHER energy drink out there.

"My husband was really excited about these things. He read about them in a magazine over a year ago before they were available for purchase, and decided to buy them for me as a gift (now that they're available), to replace the two ice cubes I dump in my coffee every morning to make it ""chuggable"". Um, I'm not impressed. My coffee remained too hot to drink initially (just as it would be WITHOUT them in it), and was cold within one hour (again, JUST like it would be WITHOUT them in it). In fact, the only thing different about my coffee with these little Joulies in it is there was a LOT less room in my cup for actual coffee because they're quite large and you need several in your cup. Maybe they're more geared for those who enjoy their coffee in travel mugs? And because I cannot speak to this I thought one star would be inappropriate.<br /><br />I will of course lie and tell my husband they're miraculous and wonderful. But secretly I wish he'd saved the $50 because my ice cubes have been working just fine for years and are what I'll continue to use when he's not around.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I just realized these things cost him $60 and decided to return them!",Unimpressed,2

I dutifully drank three cups so I could give it a fair assessment, and the last cup tasted as bad as the first. I even added a spoonfull of chocolate powder to the last cup to make it palatable. That only helped marginally.<br /><br />I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It may be low acid and make one's tummy feel better, but it's a big price to pay for the comfort. Now I'm disappointed that I still have a little of this stuff left.

Still, I couldn't get past the fact that it smelled overwhelmingly like a funeral home / aunt gertrude's perfume while tasting like a bowl of froot loops.<br /><br />I suppose I had hoped for a more neutral base with subtle accents of flavor.

"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.","Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie",2

They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe, but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.

Unfortunately, I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.<br /><br />I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening, I have reduced the amount I use even more.

I've tried many of both iced coffee beverages and coffees with espresso shots from the big chain, and I've found them completely delightful, though expensive.

But there is no possability I could eat them as the manufacturer has served them up.<br /><br />To be sure that this was not some oversensitivity on my part, I offered the cannister to a friend -- casually and without comment. He ate two or three and begged me for a beverage to clear his mouth, saying he thought he must be ""allergic"" to something in them, because they ""made his mouth burn.""<br /><br />I'm just baffled that the seasoning is this unpleasantly strong yet sold in a cannister that suggests a mild freshness.

"Look at the label in the picture.  Sorry folks, but 610 mg sodium per 100 g (that's only about 3.5 oz) can't really be ""low sodium"".

"These are actual slices of tuna that can be either a treat or a meal for your cat or dog. As others have mentioned, I too had trouble getting the package open. You are supposed to tear off the top and then open a resealable zip closure. But by the time I got to the tuna, the zip was ruined, so it became a meal for my cats. The tuna was easy to handle and broke up into smaller bite-sized bit without any effort. It also was not as ""fishy"" in smell as you might expect.<br /><br />Did my cats like it? Of Yeah!

The directions state to use 1 1/2 pumps for hot drinks- well this was way too much for my taste. The pumpkin spice flavor was overwhelmingly harsh and spicy. I found if I used enough for it to be sweet, then it was way too spicy. When I used a smaller amount, I had to use sugar to sweeten my coffee. I normally like spicy flavors but this is just too strong. I'm not sure how we'll ever make our way through the flavors. I don't plan on repurchasing.",Not so great,2

"Ok, first off I need to mention I didnt but this b/c I need anything gluten or dairy free.  I bought this because I tend to ""eat clean"" for the most part and wanted a quick semi clean cheese sauce without worry of a ingredient list filled with junk (think of a dyed bright yellow clump of so called ""cheese product"") My idea was to use this as a cheese sauce for some Quinoa and broccoli, much like a cheddar cheese rice bake, sounds yummy right? Anyways when it came time to make the sauce I almost cried, it smelled like a strong soup base, (like bouillon cubes) The smell seemed to get slightly milder, but upon tasting a lick off the spoon I was more than tempted to trash the whole thing and just whip up some cheese sauce from scratch.  Instead I improvised and added about a handful of mozzarella cheese, a handful of cheddar cheese and and a half a cup of milk to the mix and while it tasted like cheddar and cardboard, my kids and I ate our dinner.  Was it worth it?  Nope, not for me at least.  Now I am sure if you NEED something like this for dietary reasons, such as having a gluten allergy or dairy allergy, then perhaps your taste buds are more ""willing"" but for me, this was a complete waste.",Might as well made it from scratch!,2

One will say Natural and the other (as shown by Amazon here) will say Natural and Artificial Flavor.<br /><br />In talking with a representative at Good Earth, I have been informed that they still make Sweet & Spicy without the artificial flavor. I expressed my concern as to their lack of clear differentiation on packaging.

"I used to drink Twinings India Spice Chai in the gold box daily and with great pleasure. It was so much better than Tazo (all ginger and vanilla) and the other supermarket brands (all cinnamon). Before I found it on Amazon I could only get it at the CostPlus/World Market, but happily made the trip. It was often sold out but STILL worth trying for.<br /><br />Then Twinings decided to change their recipe. I think in an attempt to taste more like Tazo, they took out all the subtle masala chai flavors and just dumped in a ridiculous amount of cardamom. It's literally enough to make your tongue a little numb and kills all the background flavors.<br /><br />The positive thing I can say is that it's still super cheap and convenient on Amazon Subscribe. And if you don't care about subtleties in flavor, the overload of cardamom eventually seems to kill those taste buds and it becomes less oppressive over time.

I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter.

"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories.

"Based on our experience I would give this product 1 star, but I concede that our dog's reaction may not be typical.<br /><br />We gave our dog one of these early in the evening.  He's a mid-sized dog at about 35 lbs, but he's also a strong chewer.  Based on what I could tell from the package, though, I had no reason to believe I should buy the larger size.  We were in the room and casually observed him as he chewed on it.

However, when we got home from work, it was clear that the poor guy had been struggling not to have an accident.  When we got him outside, he had multiple explosive bowel movements.

"Sorry I bought this -- my terrier mix was not challenged in the least.<br /><br />It is a good idea, and I liked that it provides the opportunity for three different games because I thought the variety would be a plus, but all three games are too easy.<br /><br />The basic problem is that for two of the games -- the two where the treat is uncovered by sliding a piece -- the sliding pieces are so easily displaced that they pose no challenge.  The slightest touch makes them slide.<br /><br />The remaining problem is that the third game -- the one in which the covers have to be lifted -- requires the dog to do nothing more than what a dog does naturally:  pick up something with its mouth.  No biggie.<br /><br />I can see how this toy would be valuable to an extremely old, arthritic dog, who would appreciate the minimal effort needed to attain a treat.  Other than that, I think it is a waste of money.  An average dog would be unchallenged and a smart dog would be positively bored.",Not Challenging -- Too Easy for Most Dogs,2

I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.

I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.

In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.

"A few weeks ago I bought two boxes of packaged chestnut product from Costco (don't remember the brand). That was the first time I bought pre-packaged chestnut. It was peeled, perfectly cooked, and delicious!! Unfortunately they were no longer in stock when I went back and tried to purchased it again. So I went online and found this product on amazon.<br /><br />I signed up for subscribe-and-save, and I figured I would have a long term relationship with this product. Shipping was prompt and the package arrived in good condition. I tore open a bag and was eager to give myself a treat. Then I saw them, the dark (nearly black), soggy, soft chestnuts half-naked hidden inside the mushy shells. I was thinking to myself, hmm, this doesn't look like something delicious. Reluctantly I peeled one chestnut and put it into my mouth. It was stale, soggy, and a little bit sweet, far from what I had expected. I decided to give it a second chance and put the second one in my mouth. It was even worse. It was rotten and had a terrible bitter taste. I quickly spit it out and realized I made a big mistake.<br /><br />I was going to give this product only one star. But realizing I had a very high expectation which may affect my objectivity, I'm giving it two stars in the spirit of being fair. In any case, I do NOT recommend this product.

"Unless you are already feeding your dog a low end dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is not something I'd recommend feeding to your pet.<br /><br />I try to feed our dog better grade dog food.  Right now he is eating Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix.  There are several other high quality pet foods available.<br /><br />If you'd rather skip this review and are looking for a better quality dog food, there are several out there, some of which strive to serve ""natural/organic"" products.  Here are justa few, listed alphabetically:  Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, Merrick (who recently merged with Castor and Pollux), and Wellness.<br /><br />Chef Michael's is a Purina product.  While not trying to malign Purina, I am not aware of any better quality dog foods they produce.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order, directly from the label:<br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. C-5900.<br /><br />Nothing against beef for my dog, so it doesn't start out bad.  But after that....soybean meal and soy flour are just ""protein fillers"".  The next largest ingredient is animal fat.  Animal fat can come from numerous sources, including rodents, diseased animals, and you really just don't know the source.  After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is ""chewy"" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a ""candy"" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all.",Low Quality Dog Food,2
"MY dog doesn't like many treats so I was delighted when I found the small packs at Petsmart.  They no longer carry them. Going online, I discovered that you sell them.

I don't know if this is a one time thing or the change is permanent.  I am very, very disappointed. The other treats I bought at the same time are the same, or at least she eats them sometimes.<br />So I probably won't be purchasing the dumbbells again, especially since the price has gone from under $30 to $40...<br />Thanks<br />Marye",Pet NShape Dumbbells  32oz,2

"This product shipped quickly which was the highlight of this experience.<br /><br />When I opened the shipping box, I found a zip lock plastic bag with all of the sticks contained loosely within. There was no labeling at all on the bag or in the box. If you are like me you like to know the product information especially country of origin, preparation method, and manufacturer.  The HPD information states that these sticks come from free-roaming bulls, but, who knows what I received. The smell of the product is sickly sweet and fairly pungent.<br /><br />What was most disappointing though was the size of the sticks. An average size is about 1/2 inch in parameter. Many are around 1/4 inch.  Only a few are close to 1 inch.<br /><br />My cocker spaniel plowed through one of these sticks in about five minutes.  Hardly the distraction that I intended.<br /><br />Typically I purchase Cadet 12"" bully sticks, cutting them down to 4 inch sticks.

However, upon opening the first package, all I saw were sunflower seeds...lots and lots of sunflower seeds.  An average handful would be a overwhelming majority of sunflower seeds with some pumpkin seeds, maybe 2 almonds, a couple of raisins, one or two cranberries, and I'd only get a tiny blueberry or two every 3-4 handfuls.  I was really surprised.  If I had saw this mix in a clear plastic bag at the grocery store, I would think it was bird seed.<br /><br />Wondering how it got such great reviews, I read them (something I should have done prior to purchasing).

"I admit I bought a box of these at an Organic Sensitive Aware Health food grocery store, so I expected it to be expensive. However, this one deserves to be an entry in Consumer Reports' last page, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of at the moment.  Each month, the last page of CR's magazine has pictures people send in of scandalously absurd ripoffs, ad goofs, typos, etc, such as a picture of a six-inch tall pill bottle with the 1/2 cubic inch of actual pills that came in it --i.e. making the packaging look real big so the sucker customer will not realize the contents are so paltry.  Enjoy Life's marketing department did its job well; the box is 5 1/4""H x 6 1/2""W x 1 1/2"" D: the actual food item, once you unwrap the (5 1/2"" inch long) foil packet is just under 3"" long, less than 1/2"" wide, & 3/8"" deep.  I was driving when I ripped open the packet, & almost drove off the road when I beheld the veritable rat-poo dimensions of the bar.  Yes, it is sold by weight (5 oz; the things are dense), but the packaging is ridiculously misleading.<br /><br />Oh, the taste.  It's okay; vaguely sunflower seed-ish, merely the barest rumor of a whisper of sweetness or salt; as with most GF food manufacturers, Enjoy Life seems to feel that those of us who must forego gluten, or dairy or nuts or whatever also have no interest in flavor.  It does have a nice chewy mouth feel to it, which would have been nicer had there been more to feel.<br /><br />In a (presumably) unconscious self-satire, in big letters on the back of the box, it says ""Still Hungry?""  Well yes, and I know several people who would answer same if they ate the entire box of bar-lets, particularly if they'd been expecting something appropriate to the size of the box.","mediocre taste, hilariously misleading packaging",2

"On the face of it, THE SWITCH Orange Tangerine beverage sounds quite good. It's a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water. No added sugar, preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health-conscious. You get 140 calories from one 8.3 ounce can. (Probably too small a serving for most people.) There are small portions of natural flavor and coloring, gum acacia, ascorbic acid (i.e., Vitamin C) and soy. In case quantities, it's priced at under a dollar per can. Sounds pretty decent, right?<br /><br />The trouble is: it just doesn't taste that good to me. There is a vaguely unpleasant metallic quality to this stuff that I can't imagine many people warming up to. Perhaps the juice has reacted with the aluminum of the can. Perhaps my can had been sitting on the shelf for too long. Perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste; it's something I haven't tried before. Perhaps I got a bum can. Perhaps THE SWITCH just plain sucks. I really don't know, but I do know that I won't be drinking any more of it in the near future.",Strange...,2

The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.

"First let me say that it's refreshing to get something from Vine to eart or drink and be obligated to comment on nothing but its flavor, as opposed to half a dozen claims by the product's makers about its health effects, nutritious contents, etc.<br /><br />Alas, that was all the refreshment I got out of this beverage.<br /><br />It's not exactly disgusting, but the taste is pretty unpleasant.  The mix of ginger to lemon is way off, I think, and the ginger is fairly overpowering; the spiciness of it actually burned my sinuses a bit.  And I mixed the powder into a little more water than the instructions called for, which makes that intensity of flavor way too much.  As for the lemon, it's just flavorful enough to provide a sour background to the concentrated spiciness.  The combination is not pleasant at all.  Having tasted it once, I think I can safely say I will never drink this  beverage again.",Yuck,2
"If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men which would be weird) it's just okay.  One packet does little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHo drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature?  Also, with only 8 packets (the raspberry pom) in a box, that gives you 4 16 oz drinks for $3.  Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this, equally as bland but free.",I wouldn't bother.,2

"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.

This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?<br /><br />But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.",Pineapple flavored coconut water from Indonesia... there's something we really need!,2

"When I prepared this I was hoping for the anti-hamburger helper and unfortunately got more of the same.  The seasonings did nothing to make this stand out.  It was a nice box-meal but there was nothing distinct about it.  The amount of noodles provided were inadequate as well.  The ultimate cheeseburger mac tasted like every other cheesy-mac that I have tasted. The use of Velveeta cheese made the cheese taste smoother to the palate but other than that it is the same.  If you have a particular affinity for Velveeta cheese and like mac and hamburger then this would be the purchase for you.  The directions were easy to follow, the only ingredients you need to add are water and ground hamburger.  It is a simple easy meal to prepare.",Average in taste,2

"I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out.","Good idea, but material is not strong enough",2

I thought these were ok. Not great but not terrible. I'll end up eating the rest of them but I don't know if I'll continue to buy them. I like that they are individually packaged. I like their medium size. I like that they are soft-baked.<br /><br />Otherwise I thought they were rather dry and tasteless and they did a lot of crumbling.  The almonds were whole but small and the chocolate was in small chunks but there weren't enough of either to be a very strong taste.  I even thought it could have used more oatmeal which maybe would have kept it from being so crumbly.<br /><br />I guess I was just expecting more of a sweet taste from something with chocolate and almonds.  Adding brown sugar probably would have ruined the nutrition label but it would have helped the taste problem considerably.,Just OK,2

"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.","Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me",2

"While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more ""exposed"" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this ""OneCup"" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a ""house"" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant.","Good coffee, not a K-Cup",2

"When you see ""ginger & lemon beverage mix"" a reasonable person expect a balanced refreshment. That is not what you get. If you like to munch on ginger in your spare time, this is a drink for you. The ginger taste is overbearing and overpowering, and the only hint of lemon I got was a sourness in the aftertaste.<br /><br />Speaking of, the aftertaste so strong, as strong as but distinct from the main taste, that I ended up throwing half my glass down the drain. I've drank some odd things in my day (passion fruit and aloe juice, for instance), but I just couldn't tolerate this. And, just for good measure, the package was a bear to open for me.<br /><br />On the plus side, the mix is some nice yellowish pellets (about the size of the wax ball you see on new pens sometimes) that dissolve quickly and cleanly in hot water.

"My English Springer Spaniel absolutely loves food. It doesn't matter what it is - if it's edible, she's game. My cockapoo is more of a picky eater, so you really have to try hard to find anything she'll try.

They readily took a treat each and promptly dropped them on the floor. I picked one up to try to give it to the cockapoo and she took off down the stairs and out the dog door. Turning to my springer who, as I said, never turns down anything edible (in her opinion), I tried to coax her into giving it another try. Being a sport, she took it in her mouth once again then trotted away and dropped it. She came back as if asking, ""okay, so now where are the real treats."" I finally gave up trying to coax either dog to bite into the treats and just left them laying on the floor for them when they wanted them. Yeah, that never happened. I can understand my cockapoo not eating the treats because she's really picky, but my springer not enjoying them shocked me. They smell like normal dog treats to me! No, I did not try them and nor will I ever be tempted to taste a dog treat. I do plan on trying them out on other dogs and will post an update if one of the pups actually eats one.

"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.

So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.

We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).",Tasty but with a big drawback,2

"We have three dogs.  One will eat anything, one will eat almost anything, and one is a picky eater.  Fortunately, the picky eater is the chihuahua.  Part of the picky eating comes from his sensitive stomach, and we avoid chicken and turkey because that consistently upsets his stomach.<br /><br />The first time he was offered Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, he devoured it with pleasure, and I was ecstatic to have a dry food that got some enthusiasm.  Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was gone by the next day, and he absolutely refused to eat it for two days.  We gave up.  If he'd rather eat the big dogs' food than eat his premium food, there is no  point in spending extra for a more expensive food.<br /><br />From my point of view, the ""premium"" seemed to be mostly the ""Chef Michael"" name, as it didn't seem to have any better ingredients than the other Purina foods.  Beef was the first ingredient, but it was followed by soy meal and soy flour. (Can we say GMO?) It also contained chicken by products (a long ways under the soy products, by the way.)  Even salt appears before green beans and potatoes.  It is cuter than regular kibble, but I don't think the dogs care.  It also has varying textures, but once again, even when I let the big dogs try it, they weren't overly impressed.<br /><br />My opinion is that either spend more and get real premium food or save your money (unless you want attractive kibble) and just buy a standard dog food.",He ate it once and then never again,2

I microwaved them for slightly less time than instructed and only about 1/5 of them changed consistency from the little flat parallelograms to a slightly puffier flat paralleogram.  Next batch I did a little longer and a couple more of them puffed up a little bit.  Even the puffy ones seem to have patches of tremendously hardened pork(don't laugh) in them to a point where when you eat one and there are pork rind shards that break away from the puffy.  I tried one last time and microwaved them for a minute and a half longer than instructed and this time the puffy ones overcooked and burned and the others stayed in tiny, hard form(again, don't laugh).<br /><br />If anyone that orders these and learns any tips that I might be missing, please let me know.

"I am a hot chocolate freak.  I was very anxious to try the varieties of hot chocolate with my new Keurig.  This cocoa was my first purchase.  It was so terrible I almost brought it back.  First, it took half the box to get the plastic taste out of the drink. A Keurig issue.  That last half of the box didn't redeem itself.  This cocoa tastes like flavored water, flavored with diet sugar.  It has the same aftertaste you would get with a diet soda or a sugar-free yogurt.  Also, you can't get more than 8 oz per cup. If you do, the taste just gets more watered down. A huge disappointment.  I will be trying other brands but my expectations are very low based on this first experience.<br /><br />I read a few reviews and learned that this product contains sucralose.  It is not listed as an ingredient.  Explains the diet taste plus I don't trust manufacturers who pull stunts like this.

"While finding a line of salt free beans at a reasonable price was great, I have had a hard time using up these kidney beans, they are mushy; unpleasantly so.  You'd think they would make a good bean in bean soup or refried beans, but I didn't think so.  A friend tried them as a shortening substitute in cookies with the best results; taste was fine once she ran the beans through the food processer and added them to cookie dough  - but what isn't.  Blending them and then using them as an addition to soup or 'secret vegies' in meatloaf and the like may have been the best use.<br />I did a little experimentation and evidently salt helps beans from turning unappealingly mushy.  I've learned to either cook my own and add just a touch of salt or use a 'low salt' product.  Color and size are good.",A disappointment,2

"I don't enjoy this blend much, but as another reviewer mentioned perhaps it needs a Melitta coffee maker for it's full potential.<br /><br />I've made 3 pots:<br /><br />First I followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). I got brown colored water.<br /><br />Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called ""Eight O'Clock"" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better.",Not My Cup Of Coffee,2

I bought this product due to all the good reviews.  I bbq using a weber smokey mountain often.  I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.  I just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this.,Beware of the good reviews this is a very salty rub,2

"I bought this mainly because another review (can't remember if it was on Amazon or another site) said it was better than Morningstar Farms crumbles and because it is GMO free. Now, I've been a vegetarian since I was thirteen (and that was decades ago), but I am the sort that DOES want fake meat resembling meat. I've little interest in a mushroom-quinoa burger; I want a meaty-yet-vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side. Also, I'm a professional chef, so I'm very picky about the foods I eat.<br /><br />I'm saying this because I think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review.<br /><br />Tonight, I used the Harmony Valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese. I also did the same recipe with the MF crumbles to compare. Two things I was curious about:<br /><br />1) flavor: they're *kind of* about the same, especially considering I was adding a browned mirepoix, marmite, and veg Worcestershire ... I guess I should fry up a patty of just the HV mix, but I did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay, but blander than MF<br /><br />2) texture: MF wins. It just does (sorry, MF haters). It has larger pieces with a more meat-like texture. Plus, even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove, the HV was too wet.<br /><br />Now, the reviewer who also liked it better than MF also said something about it holding together on its own and that MF doesn't. Well, that's true. This was thick and stuck to itself, much more like the texture of ground meat - if you were to puree it. I use MF often in meatballs, and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese. I guess that's the difference; I don't just want to thaw or add water and *poof* have dinner. I expect to cook with an ingredient, the same as I would with real beef.<br /><br />So I wasn't bowled over in those ways, but I liked it. HV hamburger mix is good and I'm sure it will be useful, which is also a plus - no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles, you've got a half dozen packets at home. I have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living, so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home. And although I've seen some reviews complaining about the 15-20 wait for the HV mix to absorb water in the fridge ... really? Those people can't wait half an hour for a burger? If you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup, buy a frozen burger. I think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and I look forward to trying!<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />After eating the lasagna made with the HV mix, both my husband and I experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain. I'm apparently a glutton for punishment, though, because I decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday. Not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones (made with MF crumbles and Lightlife sausage), they had a sort of rubbery texture that I really did not care for. But, blander and texture I can overlook, except AGAIN, the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas. Ugh!","Mixed review: convenient, okay taste, bad stomach problems",2

"I just cannot understand why this company chooses to add sugar to a fruit that they claim is tree-ripened.  I am truly baffled.  The added sugar leaves a crystalline sweetness that is not mango-flavored to the fruit and renders it a ridiculous replacement for mango.  It ends up being too sweet.<br /><br />Why buy dried mango?  If you cannot get fresh mango, it is the next best thing.  Canned mango, because the canning procedure demands heating the food above boiling point, dismantles all enzymes and antioxidants, but the drying process does not.  There are 3 fruits that are particularly valuable for the enzymes found in them: kiwi, pineapple, and mango.  These enzymes are not made by our bodies but are particularly helpful for the fast transport of calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphate, and manganese into cells whose membranes have been damaged (e.g. by circulating toxins, poisons, both of which we are always bombarded with, even if we do not recognize the symptoms).  These ions, and thus the fruit enzymes, are critical for repair of those cells.  Since bacterial infections leave poisons behind, good dried mango is especially helpful for fast recovery from infections.<br /><br />The best mango is thoroughly dried, making it quite brittle.  If you want to snack on it or make mango ice cream, you reconstitute it by adding just enough water to cover a few slices (in warm weather it will take about an hour to reconstitute 1/2 cup).  Keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose.  They last in that form there for at least a week, unless you live where there is an enormous amount of wet weather and thus a lot of mold.  Prevent mold survival in the refrigerator by keeping there a small plastic container with holes punched in the top half full of vinegar. Your fruits and veges will last a lot longer.<br /><br />However the best way to eat it is to add chopped mango to your entree or salad.  Thus this stuff this company is selling is just too weak in flavor, but the sugar will come off in the liquid found in the meal.",Tree-ripened mangoes do not need sugar added,2

"I bought a bunch of these from Walgreens just to find that none of the cans had chunks of tuna in them. They should probably re-label this product to ""tuna soup"" since this is really what this is.

"I didn't like this product.  It tastes like strongly-flavored puffed rice covered in chocolate and my first impression was ""chocolate covered popcorn"".  Mine was so melted it was soup and I had to put in the freezer to make it edible.  The melting and refreezing made it waxy and a somewhat unpleasant, unrecognizable mound of candy with which I had to literally peel the wrapper off.  My rating here is for the taste and texture only although it may or may not have tasted better if not ruined.<br /><br />*Also beware of ordering this if you live in a warm climate.  I don't enjoy receiving melted chocolate and had no other problems with any other chocolate melting that I ordered from other sources that month.  I'll assume it was the product ingredients making it susceptible to melting easily so it should have had special warm-weather wrapping when this is a problem.  Even though the vendor shipped more quickly than usual the product was ruined.  Many chocolate companies won't even sell their products during the warm months unless they can adjust to this problem and neither should this one. No refund or partial refund was even offered by the seller (O.E.I.) yet I was hounded constantly by them about my ""seller review"" per half a dozen telephone calls. I eventually deleted the seller review for reasons I'll not explain further. In my opinion, this is an over-priced waste of money.",Didn't like the flavor and don't order during warm months!,2
Saw these on Oprah and ordered them for Christmas gifts.  The packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn't help when giving as gifts.  Saved 2 packages for our family Christmas Eve treats.

These are pretty exprensive so we expected better.,Not impressed!,2
"I have a Fox/JRT/who-knows-what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the ""spin"" and ""flip"" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a ""cheater"", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a ""project in the works"", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!","Nice, basic addition to the collection...",2

"I've never had tea before that was in this form. But it really isn't tea. As the name states it is a ""beverage"" not a tea. It comes in a packet that dissolves in hot water. Gold Kili has a very strong (spicy) ginger flavor. It is difficult to describe taste in writing, but I'll try to be clear that this is a very very strong ginger spice. If you like it very strong, I am sure you mayenjoy this. As a ""beverage mix"" (in contrast to tea) it does save you having to wait for tea to steep because it dissolves instantly. In addition you don't have to clean up a tea bag. It also has sugar (sucrose) already mixed in.<br /><br />The downside is that if you prefer your drink without sweetener or perhaps with a no calorie sweetener like Truvia, that is not an option here because the honey is already mixed in.",Beverage comparison to ginger tea,3

"I am a lover of dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, this chocolate will disappoint true dark chocolate lovers.  Its waaaay too sweet!  Its not bad chocolate - its creamy, its rich, its got good cacao flavor, but they put too much sugar in it.  I prefer the very complex, slightly bitter, very dark (71% cacao) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JI0CK"">Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate</a> instead.  Also, the Newman's chocolate is broken into six relatively large 1.5 x 1.25 inch squares - IMO just a little too large to just put one square in your mouth and allow it to melt away.  The Dove is broken into 1 x 1 inch squares - the perfect size to melt on your tongue.  Even the wrapper on the Dove is better as it is true foil and easily allows you to keep the remaining chocolate wrapped up tight.  The Newman's comes in gold paper meant to look like foil, but its only paper - it does not close well.  Overall, disappointed.","nice dark chocolate, but too sweet for my taste",3

"I've tried both the pomegranate and the blackberry. Of the two, I prefer the pomegranate.<br /><br />I don't mind that is only 70% juice, that seems fine and they seem sweet enough. But, unlike the 100% sparkling grape juice I have had in the past, these two Izze flavors leave my mouth feeling somewhat dry...in a way I have not experienced with other drinks. These 8.4 fl.oz. cans contain Izze Fortified which means fortified with 10% of the USRDA of Vitamin C, Vitamin 6 and Niacin. It appears from the Izze web site that Izze in 12 oz bottles is not fortified so I might one day want to try the non-fortified Izze and see what that is like.<br /><br />However, the 100% sparkling grape juice I can buy locally, although it comes in a much larger bottle so may not be as convenient, seems more economical so, if I wanted a sparking juice, I'd probably buy that instead.

"Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor.

"This product is an interesting cross between a Keurig cup and a pod.  They work in my old B-70, but just from looking at it you can see that it contains less coffee than a typical k-cup.  As a result, it brews a decent cup of coffee on the lower setting, but it's weak as a grande.  That may work for you - at the current subscribe-n-save price it's cheap for a k-cup.<br /><br />The flavor is perfectly ok - I'm not a coffee purist, but I'd call it a dark blend more akin to Sumatran than Colombian, i.e. not so smooth.<br /><br />There is one thing I guess I should add - these things have a pod-type body, i.e. a filter-packet holding the coffee, instead of the k-cup's all-plastic body.  Typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness, but all 12 k-pods in each SFBay box are in a single, non-resealable plastic envelope.  This means that once you've opened the envelope, you're losing freshness faster than usual.

I like that these instant oatmeals are great for on the go and are a better fast breakfast option than most cold, sugary cereals.  My biggest problem with this oatmeal is the sugar content.  Although one packet might be fine for a toddler, anyone over 8 years old would probably need two packets for breakfast; however, with 12 grams of sugar in one packet, that means a two-packet breakfast gives you a whopping 24 grams of sugar!

The nutritional information states a serving size (3/4 C) contains 1 g of fat. If you add 1/2 C of skim milk, the fat content goes up. Carbs? 23 g before milk. Fiber? A meager 2 g -- a negligible amount. Protein? 2 g.<br /><br />Tastes good. Is crunchy, even with milk. But be prepared for that sugar crash late morning.<br /><br />I don't predict it will be around long. I'd much rather eat a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios... Similar taste and crunch with additional nutritional benefits.","More of a ""Kid"" Cereal",3

"This drink certainly has a nice and spicy ginger kick.  That made it interesting.  Other than that, it is honey sweetened.  I didn't notice the lemon flavor though - probably because I was too busy enjoying the ginger.  People that believe in that sort of thing think that ginger has some sort of curative effect.  I can't speak to that as I didn't have any ailments needing a cure.  Purely on conjecture, I think this drink would feel good on a sore throat.  I'd add whisky though.<br /><br />So, overall I found this to be an interesting drink but not one I'd push on friends, even if they're sick.  I have better recipes.","Interesting, but not a destination",3
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great brain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.",Good Toy,3
"I personally did not like these, but I gave the rest of the box to my mother and she had me order two more cases.  These are probably a good item for dieting because you think you are getting a lot for the calorie amount, but the flavor to me (and my husband) was sort of gummy and styrofoamy.  I could not finish a whole bag.  That didnt mean I was full, that meant I had gotten tired of them and wanted something more satisfying.  It is like eating a pound of celery when you really wanted a grilled cheese.<br /><br />By the way, I love the Pop Chips.  Much more flavor.<br />And my review was up for no less than a minute when I got a ""not helpful"" so I am not sure how this is not helpful, but the company requested that I write a review.

"I have had some of the other cheese snacks, and liked the nacho flavored.  If you have not had these before, they are literally cheese formed into a small disk and baked until hard like a cracker.  Being a low carb guy, I like them because they are easy to pack along, and are reminiscent of the crunch you get from crackers.  This particular flavor though, is underwhelming, there is not enough jalapeno flavor, and the whole thing tastes a bit like bland cheese.  Still, they are ok, and I will eat them, but not as tasty as some of the other offerings.....",OK as a low carb treat,3
"My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.","Size inconsistent, needs water",3
"Over the past year or so I have come to appreciate the depth of flavor in many dried and dehydrated vegetables.  They are great in anything that requires a long cooking time.

"-------------------------------------------------------<br />Illy Issimo Coffee Drink,<br />Caffe, 6.8-Ounce Can<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />As noted elsewhere, I'm a fan of Illy coffee, an Italian brand best known for their vacuum-sealed whole bean and ground coffee varieties. I try to keep a can or two around in case civilization breaks down and I either want a little morning jolt before the vampires attack, or if need something to trade with the survivalists and atomic mutants.<br /><br />This aluminum-clad product is a pre-made, sweetened coffee drink -- unlike the similar Illy capuccino drink, this one does not contain milk, just coffee, some sugar and a few chemicals. It has a pretty basic taste - a little metallic, actually, with the combination of the can and the white sugar. I liked their other flavor better; this one seemed uninspired, although I suppose if I had added cream, it might have perked up a bit. Guess I'll stick to their brew-it-yourself beans instead.

"For those of you not familiar with the cherry ripe, the filling is a dried and slightly candied mince of cherries and coconut. This is coated with a thin outer layer of dark chocolate. They are extremely popular in Australia, where I live, and are in fact one of the classic candy bars we all grew up with.<br /><br />On the plus side, these things are delicious. So if they don't sell them where you are and you have a yen to try another culture's junk food, let me say cherry ripes are a pretty good choice.<br /><br />On the other hand, at the current price this pack of six works out at over $3.32 per bar.

"Having enjoyed No Fear's Sugar-Free energy drinks for quite some time now and being offered the Super Energy Supplement via the Vine Program, I decided to give it a shot.  What I got was a can of generic energy drink with the standard generic citrus-like, lightly carbonated taste and a bizarre but brief aftertaste that I can best explain as tasting like the smell of old cigarette ashes.<br /><br />I had a sausage, egg, and cheese croissant on the morning that I consumed this drink, to give you an idea of what was in my stomach when I drank it.  I had stayed up fairly late the night before and really needed a bit of a kick.  Instead of my usual coffee, I opted for the No Fear instead.  Initially the taste isn't bad, but as I've already mentioned, there's a very, very brief and nasty aftertaste after each sip.  I drank the No Fear on my way to work after eating my breakfast and finished the entire can (all 260 calories of it) in a twenty-five minute period.<br /><br />Once I arrived at work, I allowed thirty minutes to pass before expecting any results.  I got none.  In fact, I was just as tired after drinking the No Fear as I was before drinking it.  This sort of surprised me, though, as the sugar-free version of this drink always gives me a good kick for a few hours.<br /><br />Overall, I think I'll stick with the sugar-free No Fear and only grab one of these if I'm in need of an energy drink and no Monster drinks are available.",Go For The Sugar-Free Version,3
"This product is really good pureed pumpkin, but I have a problem with the cans.  I took out one can from the outside of the case to make pumpkin bread.  It is wonderful pumpkin...dark orange, tasty, full of pumpkin goodness.  However, a few days later I removed the rest of the cans from the case to put them in my cupboard.  From the middle row, right in the middle of the case, there was one can that was SO badly damaged, that I am afraid to use it for fear of me and my family getting sick from bacteria.  Now, please tell me how a can that is SO badly damaged, packed in the middle of a case, can go unnoticed by the person who is packing the case???  Or, are you that big a company that you have automation packing these cases, and it is just a strange coincidence that the only dented can ended up EXACTLY in the middle? I feel the can was placed there intentionally so that I would not notice, nor would Amazon (the shipper), no matter what side of the case it was viewed from.  Folks, we are not stupid, and we will get to that middle can eventually, so you are not hiding anything.  As the end user of this product, I feel that this can of pumpkin should have been caught at packaging and thrown in the trash...just as I have to do.  It's all about quality control.  This has raised the price per can by about .25 cents.  That means that instead of me paying $2.36 per can, I have now paid over $2.60 per can.  You have a great product, but I have a problem with a company who tries to pull the pumpkin over it's customer's eyes.

"I am a bit of an energy drink addict.

But, I am always up something new, so I gave this ""No Fear Super Energy Supplement"" a try.<br /><br /> I was surprised that not only did it not taste bad, it actually tasted good!  This is the first of the big can style energy drinks that I would actually drink for the taste.  It tastes somewhat like a Cherry Cola, with a hint of that vitamin after taste.<br /><br />As far as the energy boost goes, I can't say that I really felt it.  Usually, after I drink a ""5-Hour"" drink I can feel the tiredness wiped away from my eyes and an actual physical effect.

"This is a rather expensive dog food for those of us who have XXL dogs. It doesn't come in 20-40 pound bags, so buying 4.5 pounds for that will last maybe four days isn't cost effective.

However, the dog food itself is heavy on soy, animal fat and corn products. Will I buy it again? Yes! However, that said, I do generally feed my dogs a high quality expensive kibble with some raw food thrown in. I will use Chef Michael's in a mixture of the high quality/expensive kibble and the raw.

I would have thought they'd package with a cool pack during the summer.?.  This tin size does hold a lot of toffee though!  Just wish the toffee had been more fresh tasting but I'm sure the heat didn't help the stale texture - like when you get an old Butterfinger bar.

"Shockingly, my dog seems to prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>.  Yes, if I put a bowl of beneful next to a bowl of chef michael's, she gobbles up the beneful.  I guess she can't understand the hype behind the Chef name.<br /><br />If it weren't for this basic problem, I would automatically assume that Chef Michael's would win paws down.  And if Chef Michael's is the only thing around she will eat it... reluctantly... after it sits there for most of the day.<br /><br />I was really disappointed that this was the case, as I wanted to give my sweet dog something ""better"" to eat.  She tends to shed if she eats poorly.  But I can't get her to eat Chef Michael's consistently enough to tell.  Oh well.  Whatcha gonna do.<br /><br />The Chef Michael's team missed the mark on taste for my little pupster.  Your dog may like it more.  I can only respond about my experience with it.<br /><br />I'll have to mix it in with the beneful to get rid of the bag (or just throw the half full Chef Michael's bag out, which rankles me a bit).

"Good, easy to use, somewhat hard to get the caps on, but at the end you can easily dispose of these disposable Kups after using.<br /><br />Good that you can use your own coffee.  Fresh coffees.  I personally like coffees from Spain, Puerto Rico and other countries.<br /><br />The bad, sometimes is messy.  Coffee grinds seem to leak, creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine.  This leak is more in the area of the Kups lid and cup.  And some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee.  Just read other reviews about this.  Not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee.<br /><br />On the other hand, with disposable Kups you don't need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets.

"Oatmeal is a great food. I question the supposed suggested savings being offered.<br />Since when did a canister of Oatmeal cost $35?<br /><br />That is what Amazon is saying the list price is.<br />In reality the average price is $3 to $5.<br />In fact, at this writing, Amazon actually lists a single 18oz canister as being available for $3.89<br />see  http://www.amazon.com/Quaker-Old-Fashioned-Oats-18/dp/B005GD36O8<br /><br />Using that price you actually save only $2.76  or 11.8% vs the 90% claimed.<br /><br />I don't know, perhaps Amazon is including shipping costs when they calculate the savings. However, since your local grocer includes shipping in it's advertised price, if you have to pay shipping, it's probably cheaper to go to your local grocer.<br /><br />Again, Oatmeal is great.<br />Amazon is fantastic.<br />Price is fair.<br />Just don't believe the savings claim on this product (or from what I've seen - other food products).<br /><br />Use the Trust but Verify method when shopping for anything online.",Savings = How much?,3

"On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts.

"This cereal is pretty good, as far as healthy(ish) cereals go.  But I was overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate pieces in the box.  I find myself picking out about half of them each time I pour a bowl.  They are also bland tasting - not like I expected at all.  I am disappointed that at the taste of the chocolate and that are are so many pieces, which I assume is because of the weight of them.  A box of regular Special K that has the same weight is considerably larger than this box because the heavy chocolate takes up so little space.

"These are nice and at $28, a good value.  They taste yummy and are pretty satisfying.  They're vegan, preservative free, and have only a half gram of monounsaturated fat each.

"My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.

"I'm a big fan of chicken and broccoli, at least the way my wife makes it, so I was very interested in trying this as a quick and easy meal. My first impression looking at the package was that it was a pasta dish, but then looking closer it really is orzo. The directions are straight forward and if you have cooked orzo or rice before you should be fine. However, if you overcook, as one reviewer noted, you are likely to get mush. The longest preparation was cooking the chicken (not included) so the anticipated time savings was reduced. In fresh broccoli and chicken preparations you have nice flowerettes of broccoli - here you have flakes, some would say dust. The dish then has these flakes of green which do impart a hint of broccoli and maybe this is a good way to hide the vegetable from the kids, but it gets covered up by the Velveeta cheese. You must like Velveeta cheese to enjoy this dish. Overall taste was good, but the anticipated time savings weren't achieved. In my family a split decision on the product.",Just OK,3

"There used to be a product called, ""Mrs Allen's Stop Shed."" There were separate products for dogs and cats. In March of 2006 Farnam Pet Products announced that it had acquired Mrs. Allen's Shed-Stop from Stabar Enterprises, Inc. Once acquired, Farnam changed the ""Stop Shed"" name to ""Shed Solutions"" and then discontinued the one specifically for cats. This is a case where a company acquires a product/brand (in this case, Mrs. Allen's) and messes a good thing up. I used the original products on dogs and cats for years and they were terrific. I emailed the Farnam in December of 2010 and explained my frustration that they no longer produced and sold the product made specifically for cats, and was politely told to go elsewhere for my cat shedding problem. So, now I use the ""Shed Solutions for Dogs"" for our family dog and cat. They both seem to like the favor, and it does help. Is it as good as the old product? I don't think so, but it definitely helps.

"Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.","Why, oh why, add fake sugar?",3

"In 1976 Mars brought Starburst candy (a fruity taffy) to America . These days (2008), Starburst remains an incredibly popular choice amongst tweens.

I think this candy (Starburst gummi-chews) may go the way of the lifesaver-hole. First, they don't taste anything like Starburst. Second, the liquid candy filling is too sweet.

The chocolate is tasty, with the granola and alone.

Not at all like coconuts - I like coconut flavored coffee and coconut oil (I even like coconut oil in my coffee a la ""Bulletproof Coffee""). I've also found hard particulate matter, just a little bit, in the bottom of my coffee mug.

"There are two pouches in each box.  The first, you add water and vodka, if desired.  You can either chill the rehydrated product, or freeze it for a frozen treat.  We enjoyed the frozen preparation and are looking forward to trying it martini style.  The second pouch in the box is a green rimmer.  I applied the rimmer as described on the box, only to be surprised by salt.  The rimmer is described as sugar and is listed as sugar on the ingredients list.  The pouch was labled ""green margarita"" rimmer.  Clearly there was a mistake made during packaging.  The salty margarita rimmer does not compliment the drink.  Of the 4 boxes included in my order, 3 of the boxes contained the salty ""green margarita"" rimmer.  The fourth box has the correct ""green apple martini"" rimmer.  The sugar rimmer is an excellent addition to the drink.  The rimmer is a generous portion, so it will be enough for all 4 boxes, but be careful of the unpleasant salty rimmer.",Nice summer treat!,3

"Just had my first cup of this coffee.  It is strong, just how I like it, and has a nice aroma.  Because this is micro-ground it comes through the brewer much faster than the regular K-Cups.  I am not a coffee snob but do enjoy a good strong cup in the morning to get my motor running, this fits the bill just fine.  The price makes it a deal breaker, I just ordered more to add to my collection of different varieties of coffee.  I am well satisfied and hope you will be too.<br />____UPDATE from my original review.  After using this for several weeks, I will have to agree that this is not up to snuff with regular K-Cups---I don't think it's as bad as some think but is not as good as the regular ground coffee.

Overall, I like it.<br />My kids and hubby, however, have their reservations.  It is much thinner than standard ""syrup"" their used to, and the Grade B definitely has a strong maple flavor.  So if you like that, this is the syrup for you.<br /><br />Once this is all used up (I plan on baking with it as well), I plan on re-ordering the same brand,<br />only the Grade A.  Maybe that will ease them into true maple syrup a little easier!<br /><br />All in all, a great price and good syrup.  My family just isn't quite ready for the strong maple kick!

One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.

"My gang is typically not very fussy when it comes to food - if it doesn't move (or, at least move too much) they'll eat it. So, I was pretty sure they'd like this up-scale food.<br /><br />Surprisingly, one did not - while she didn't turn up her nose at it, she didn't really want to eat it either.  The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the ""mini"" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess).

They need to be shipped in a tight box rather than the large box they were delivered.<br /><br />I operate a small shop inside an office building, and really would like to continue ordering these soups, however, they are too expensive to lose 25% upon delivery.<br /><br />Thanks, I look forward to improvements...at least in shipping.<br /><br />Regards,<br />John Jean<br />[...].",Shaken and stirred,3

"Nothing too spectacular with these hard candy. Tried a few but first they must be removed from their individual and sometimes annoying, packaging. Sugar free is a good thing but who really knows what the term really means when they are using sorbitol?

I associate that name with safe for people trying to avoid sugar, even though I have been challenged several times, perhaps by people that are trouble makers at best but obviously more informed on the subject than I will ever be.  Yes, they have their little taste for they are very tiny for all the unwrapping it requires to consume them and who knows which fruit is which, in the end they all seem to taste the same. Not like eating a mint mentos where the moment it goes in your mouth you know exactly what you are getting. Still, they serves its purpose, for the person that I bought these morsels consumes them without truce, and that makes me content, for I am trying in my limited ways to keep this person from consuming large quantities of sugar, if I can help it, which is not all the time.

"Okay, let's get one thing out of the way first. Velveeta is to American Cheese, what American Cheese is to Mild Cheddar. We're talking about a substitute for a substitute here.<br /><br />But if you're used to powdered cheese, this isn't too bad. It's not as good as a can of spray cheese, so we're certainly not talking gourmet here.<br /><br />Consider this meal to be a Hamburger Helper alternative. You don't need a bunch of stuff in your pantry. You don't need to think about gathering ingredients. You just need a pound (or so) of lean ground beef, and a skillet. The big advantage this has over Hamburger Helper is that the ""cheese"" (using the term loosely) is already a sauce. You don't need a quarter or half cup of milk, which is a big plus for someone like me who doesn't drink milk.<br /><br />Make sure you use very lean ground beef - 90/10 or leaner. Anything less lean, and between the oil in the ""cheese"", and what you aren't able to completely drain-off will make a mess of your meal. It won't look anything like the picture on the package if you do that!<br /><br />So if priced the same as Hamburger Helper, I'd pick this. But if I wasn't going to buy a Hamburger Helper-style meal to begin with, there's no reason to get this. It's just something to eat. It's not a culinary feast. (It's sure nothing you'd want to serve guests, unless you're trying to show how poor you are.)","Okay, If You Like This Kind of Thing",3
"I try to buy organic products whenever possible; so I decided to try this. I usually do not use milk quickly enough to justify buying a gallon of fresh milk; so this sounded good. I cannot find it in any of the stores in my area and Amazon is easy to deal with so this seemed like a good choice. Organic Valley should be a bit more forthcoming with specifics about this product; since many of us may not be familiar with it. I have used a lot of other nonfat dry milk products, but this is quite different. Although the actual product description does not state that it is ""non-instant"", if you enlarge the picture, you can just barely read it on the front of the package. The mixing instructions on the package tell you that you can stir or shake to mix the milk, but your blender or an electric mixer are probably your best options. Stirring produces a very lumpy, undissolved mess. I called Organic Valley and spoke with a very complacent woman who informed me that she puts the dry milk and water in a jar and shakes it vigorously to mix it. She also informed me that since it is not an instant product, once it is mixed, you will need to stir or shake it again if it is not used immediately; because the mix will begin to settle. Once it is actually dissolved, the taste is wonderful: it tastes absolutely fresh.",Needs more specific information in the description,3

"INGREDIENTS<br />Yet another ""natural"" product trying to capitalize on the public's belief in the magic of hype.  As both a scientist & a naturopath, I would like to promote some logical analysis into the mix.  Firstly, as you may remember from chemistry class, there are various types of sugars (e.g. glucose, sucrose, fructose).  Most naturopaths prefer fructose--which often comes from fruit.  However, fruit tends to be expensive so (to be competitive) manufacturers frequently use high fructose corn syrup--a concentrated product from corn.  Guess what?  Corn is just as natural as fruit is.  But then so are sugar cane and sugar beets--but the mix of sugars differs among sources.  So, what is important is the type of sugar (not the source) and (perhaps more importantly) the amount of it--since Americans tend (according to statistics) to eat far too much sugar (and salt and fats...).  Apparently this is a learned behavior as some experiments seem to indicate.  So, giving your kids lots of sodas to keep them happy is a short term approach creating a long term problem for them--not a great legacy.  True, this product evades the addition of artificial coloring, artificial flavoring, & preservatives--this is good.  It also includes acerola (a terrific source of vitamin C--look in your vitamins catalog and notice that some Vit C tablets advertise acerola as a plus for them).  But the can doesn't say how much acerola or Vit C--only that it meets the 100% recommended dosage.  This is essentially meaningless; it's the dosage to prevent scurvy--in the West today that likelihood is pretty remote.  Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling recommends 3000 to 5000 mg of Vit C daily--more than a case of Switch per day per person to achieve.  Of course, the scientific community has not accepted Pauling's argument--but then, to my knowledge, it's never been scientifically tested either.  It works for me though.<br /><br />TASTE & PACKAGING<br />As usual, the advertised flavor is not the main ingredient--usually it's apple or pear--here it's apple & grape.  Some people will tell you they taste them.  I don't.  I think they need to do a blind taste test--one's perceptions are mostly based on one's expectations.  I doubt they'd taste apple if they didn't know it had apple in it--but who knows?  Maybe they're budding professional tasters?  I found the black cherry taste reminds me of the old Franks' Black Cherry Sodas in big bottles delivered in wooded cases when I was a kid--though Switch's seems a bit strong to me.  But, of course, the case had to last all week--so we had to drink sparingly--unlike today.  You didn't drink from those bottles directly--as you did from the old green coca-cola bottles--which tasted better than aluminum or steel cans.  I find that I can sometimes taste the steel but not the aluminum from cans.  There's none from the can here.  Aluminum may be more expensive to use.  Both can be recycled (and are, where I live).  But, it actually costs more to recycle almost anything than to get new materials--so we have to pay the county MORE to recycle.  The one glaring exception is aluminum.  Aluminum yields a profit when you recycle it.  As far as I know (except for newspapers in bulk), it's the only material that does.  So I consider the use of aluminum a plus.  Of course, there is less aluminum because it's only an 8.3 oz can vs. the more common (in the US) 12 oz can.  This may seem strange in the States, but in Europe the smaller can is quite common.  Perhaps, it would encourage people to drink less of it--which would actually be a good thing because it's just not very healthy.  You'd be better off drinking water.  And, even bottled water is a lot cheaper per oz. than the almost $1 per can even if you buy a case with the Amazon $1 off/case discount.  So, if you buy it, drink it for the taste, not for its supposed health contribution.",Yet another...,3

Who knew dogs like cinnamon?!<br /><br />Anyhoo, seems to like them fine, and I definitely like the fact that they are lo cal, but the price...geez...a little overpriced!  I always thought the Greenies were good, but crazy expensive, and these seem to be priced at least as high as Greenies.<br /><br />Also, the fact that the manufacturer instructions indicate two of these sticks a day, and the fact that there are about 6-8 a pack, seems a little crazy.  So buy 2 packs a week?!  Come on...make a box with 30 or 40 if you want people to actually follow your instructions without buying a silly amount of bags of these things (and hopefully to help get cost down)!  They probably don't do this because people would get sticker shock if they saw these priced in a box (would be approx. $30-$40!)<br /><br />Pricing is way off, but product seems to be good.<br /><br />Edit:  After trying these out, I signed up for a ""subscription"" to have the larger version (in the shape of bones) delivered via Amazon...and for my biggish dog, I like the bone version much better...he spends more time chewing it (partly why I wanted these was to use as a teeth cleaning device).  If you have a big dog (>70 lbs or so I guess), you might want to check out the Large Zoe dental chew treats instead.

Construction seems somewhat sturdy but it has not had much use in our household to really be tested.  Filling it is a bit of a pain as you have to unscrew the screw at the top.

"I was pretty much raised on granola bars (Mom was ahead of her time) and as an adult like to have protein or granola bars around for meal substitutes.<br /><br />These bars are smaller than normal granola bars, which accounts for less calories and fat grams, from the get go. To me they tasted sweeter than they should be, and more like eating a bad rice crispy treat. The chocolate drizzle helped with the taste, but not by much, but I really didn't get the peanut butter taste. At all.<br /><br />As to holding back hunger or as a meal substitute. Nope, not gonna happen. There is just not enough substance. Now as a SNACK in between meals, then yes not a bad idea.I'll keep them handy til we go through the box, but probably will not purchase them for continued use.",Not bad...but....,3
"I am a big fan of home made cookies, particularly chocolate and oatmeal cookies. I also will eat an occasional Chips Ahoy cookie. The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond is okay but I would likely never buy them. The taste is not as good as the homemade or Chips Ahoy and I not fond of the texture as well. They are a bit bland and not that soft. They are also filled with the usual large list of chemicals found in most commercial products of this type. I realize they must be preserved to last for months and must retain their softer texture through artificial means. I will likely finish the box I have, but cannot really recommend them.",Not for me,3

"I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the ""organ"" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake.

"I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.<br /><br />It doesn't taste good enough to be a juice replacement--and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.<br /><br />So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy.",A drink without a category,3

"If it was my first matcha i would had given it 5 starts but I feel i have to disagree with the majority of reviewers.<br />Its certainly a good quality matcha but i found it lacks aroma and taste compared to other matchas i tried(yuuki-cha, o-cha and ippodo). The taste is very light, almost flat and you have to watch the water temperature as when going over 190 it gets very bitter(never had this problem before). By the way I always preheat my chawan, dry it, sift the matcha, check the water temperature and then whisk it.<br />As for packaging thats the first matcha i tried that comes in a inner bag. Personally i find it annoying and messy not to mention that you will have to expose the whole amount of matcha to oxygen in order to make it easier to scoop. i prefer the cans i got before that comes with sealed top and a oxygen absorber inside. I noticed the loss of flavor from Domatcha much faster than usual.<br />Would i buy it again? maybe. Cant beat the amazon fast ordering convenience. sometimes my japanese orders take too long to arrive and i found myself out of my daily green nectar. otherwise i think the extra money im paying for a higher quality is more than worth since my primary reason to drink matcha is flavor.<br />One more thing: dont bother trying to make koicha(thick ceremony style tea) with domatcha. its not the proper grade for it and you will get a very grainy/powdery/bitter drink. Otherwise it makes a good usucha and its certainly a great value for the price.",Good matcha for beginners and health conscious,3

"I added a package of the lipton to go to a 16.9 oz water bottle like the instructions say. I decided not to add the entire package all at once because I have read it is a bit too sweet. The first thing I noticed is the granules are pretty big, and it took a lot of shaking and even letting it sit a bit before it dissolved all the way.<br /><br />Right away I could smell a fruity but chemical like fragrance when I opened the bottle. The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me.

"EDIT: At the time of this review in 2006, Amazon wasn't listing nutritional information on Grocery item pages.<br /><br />--<br /><br />First of all, it's great that Amazon is stocking food in bulk, but they really do need to include nutritional information on every item page.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients here, I saw that this soup contained ""heavy whipped cream.""

"I picked up a couple of these while I was visiting my brother in LA. When I took my first bite, I thought, ""Hey, these kind of taste like a ritz cracker! Cool!""<br /><br />The second and third cracker though, I noticed a really starchy, floury taste coming through. I looked at the ingredients. Corn starch was the first ingredient.<br /><br />I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.<br /><br />Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.<br /><br />Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.<br /><br />If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else.

"How to review a dog treat?  I opened up a pack of these and tossed one to the dog figuring that might be a good place to start.  After taking a minute to sniff and inspect the treat, my dog took it and promptly devoured the thing in a few minutes.  Granted, my dog is quite large, but these definitely did not last as long as regular rawhide treats of the same size.<br /><br />Next, I sat my dog down to interview him about the product.  When I asked him if he liked the treat, he said ""yip"".  Sweet, so they are a hit.  I then asked them what they tasted like and he told me ""bark"".  Hmmm, this seemed a bit peculiar.  I thought they were supposed to be peanut butter flavored.  I then asked him about the texture and he responded ""ruff"".  So my dog liked a rough textured treat that tasted like bark, not exactly a convincing answer, but he was the judge.  I was not about to eat one to see if he was right.  He liked them and that was good enough for me.<br /><br />I fed my dog a couple of these a day.  Being a 90 pound dog, I was not concerned about feeding him two of these a day.  However, when I went outside the next day, I was greeted by piles of diarrhea.  In all due fairness to the treat, my dog did start a new medication (one he has had in the past with no issues) about this time.  I honestly cannot say if the treats or medicine did this.  I did not think of the treat causing this until I read other reviews.  I will give the product the benefit of the doubt as it could have been the medicine, but given what I saw and what other reviewers went through, I would start your dog on these treats slowly if it is their first time having them.","The Dog Said They Tasted Like ""Bark""",3
"Like many on the Atkins diet, I needed something that I could put in my bag as a snack to keep me from buying any number of high carb snacks.  These cheese mini rounds are crunchy and tasty.  They fill the bill, but only get 3 stars are they are pretty pricey for the very small amount that each bag contains.  And if you are at home, there are a few sliced cheeses that you can microwave yourself and get and even better crunchy cheesey snack.",Pleasant,3

"I've been using the Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy shampoo and conditioner for a couple weeks now, and my hair has never been healthier. I have a great mass of very long, very fine, very straight hair which has a tendency to get very static-y and has absolutely no body. From the very first use, this system made my hair feel much fuller, much smoother, much richer -- all around much more beautiful. I have never seen such an immediate or thorough effect, and all without any feeling like there was product weighing it down. However, after mixing and matching (using the shampoo and conditioner together, using the shampoo and a different conditioner, and using the conditioner and a different shampoo) I've come to the conclusion that most of the work is being done by the conditioner (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>); the shampoo with the conditioner is a *little* better, but not so much better that I feel like I have to spend the extra money on it. The conditioner I recommend without reservation; the shampoo is just a nice bonus.","Good shampoo, but the conditioner's the real find.",3

"Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.","Good taste, but not perfect",3

There was a problem though; when I opened the brown shipping box, it looked like whoever shipped it opened up my product and took out one of the pouches (it was a 12-pouch pack, the kind you would set up in a grocery store).  I also ordered a different flavor at the same time from the same company, and that box was also missing a pouch.  So in total, I was screwed out of 2 pouches of gum.

"I've been looking over some alternatives to dairy drinks to go with my meals. Plus, I might add the meals of my little boy (3.5 years). So, I was looking around in a nearby Trader Joe's  and found this interesting Pacific Natural Foods Organic Almond non-dairy beverage. It has a good, if somewhat bland, flavor and goes down easily very much like a low-fat milk. The calories per serving are moderate but the fat is a little high. I should add that the fat is non-saturated and non-trans and there is no cholesterol. The 50-50 sodium to potassium ratio is about ideal. I think the drink is a little low in protein that I should substitute it for milk in my boy's diet. All in all, I'm favorably impressed and this was my first experience with an almond beverage.

"I'm giving this three stars because it's so low in calories and doesn't cause gastrointestinal effects. It worked fine when I made my own mint chocolate with unsweetened chocolate and mint extract. That tasted good. But, it was terrible when I made chocolate biscotti (Xylitol works fine). I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong ""cotton candy"" aftertaste.<br /><br />The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the ""cotton candy"" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol.","Not a good flavor, Xylitol is much better",3

That being said, I was looking for the next taste bud hot challenge and figured I'd give this a shot.<br /><br />They don't lie when they say it's HOT.  I put a single drop on a tortilla chip and although I wasn't in pain, I was in moderate discomfort for about 10 minutes.

"I've had raisin bran from various brands, from growing up on various cereal that popped up on sale, but I don't remember any of them having as many raisins as Kellogg's Raisin Bran! It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not. Maybe it might be a new program and Amazon still has old stock.",Raisins for breakfast,3

"I bought two of these in med/lg along with Smarter Pets IQ Treat ball.  My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!",Great concept for CERTAIN dogs,3

"I normally drink Foldger's (sp) coffee and not much of that.  My regular coffee is definately strong in the acid department, at least for me.<br /><br />This coffee has no acid as far as I am concerned.

"Like every other Tazo iced tea lover, I was heartbroken when I read they changed the blend of their iced black tea. I had 6 of the old bags left and rationed them as long as I could. I broke down and bought a 3-pack of the new blend. The first batch was disappointing--it was a weak pitcher of iced tea that lacked color and taste. I didn't think I'd be able to drink another pitcher, let alone 3 full boxes of tea. But then I started adding 3 Irish Breakfast tea bags to the water, and I let the pitcher sit in the fridge overnight before drinking. Finally I've made a decent pitcher of tea with this new blend. It's dark and full-bodied and not half bad. I've got one bag of their old blend left and am going to try to concoct my own blend to match.<br /><br />If you like sweet tea, try taking 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, mix with enough water to cover the sugar, then microwave for a minute to dissolve the sugar. Pour into the pitcher and stir, then let sit overnight. It's a delicious guilty pleasure.","Not as good as their old blend, but it's still decent",3

"Convenience is probably the best feature of this machine but a machine that heats, grinds, steams, packs and pumps is bound to compromise somewhere and this machine is no exception.  The Vienna Plus will not pump coffee at the finer grind settings.  On the other hand, coffee at the factory setting is not bad.<br />I drink my coffee black which means that the taste is not obscured by milk, froth, or spices.  But coffee straight from the Vienna Plus is muddy, foamy, and poorly filtered. Since I like the speed with which a cup can be produced on this machine I pour it through a chemex paper filter and lo! poor coffee<br />is transformed into something quite good! It's not quite as good as chemex coffee made manually but it's in the ball park and it is much more quickly produced.<br />Other reviewers have complained about the plastic housing of the Vienna Plus but I suppose a solid metal housing would cost far more.  A more serious complaint is the plastic interior. The water may be heated in stainless steel but it is poured through a plastic brew group and hot water processed through plastic is likely to release small amounts of toxins into the coffee.",Necessary compromises,3

I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.,If you're expecting full chip flavor reconsider getting another brand of chips.,3

You'll probably like this if you like ginger - it does have a strong ginger taste that often lingers afterwards in the form of an aftertaste.  The lemon provides an interesting counterbalance to the ginger - upon first sip it overpowers the ginger but the subtle ginger flavor often comes back as an aftertaste.  Some may prefer the aftertaste and others may not.<br /><br />What I do like is that it is an interesting and different alternative to the more common tea flavors we get in America. It definitely has a very strong Asian smell and taste that will either attract or detract.  I would say it's a matter of taste and to try just one box before buying a group.  My spouse loved the tea but I didn't care for it.,Interesting and Different,3

"I have 4 mini dachshunds and 1 is very picky. They have tried FunBites CalciBone chew sticks, and 3 out of 4 dogs loved them, so I was hopeful for these bones. Unfortunately, the picky one didn't like them again, and one dog, who usually likes every bone she can get, was easily distracted. She chewed on it a little, and then lost interest. The other two dogs, however, loved them.<br /><br />They are much bigger than the Chew Sticks- about an inch in diameter. There is a hard rawhide outside and a dry mixed tube of a peanut butter mixture on the middle. In some bones, the middle is firmly attached to the rawhide, making the chew time much longer (a plus since it keeps them busy longer), but in others, the rawhide is pinched and the middle tube slides out with a little chewing. This made the bone disappear quickly.<br /><br />An odd thing might keep me from buying these bones- there are 7 bones in a bag. By not having an even number, it means I have to buy 4 bags to give each dog one without leftovers. This wouldn't matter if you had a different number of dogs, but for me, it is an issue. Since the dogs were lukewarm towards them, I would probably choose to buy a bone with an even number in the bag. In all, though, they seem like a healthy treat for your little pooches!",2.5 out of 4 Dogs Approve,3
"Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds is a fine, alternative way to indulge ones chocolate/nut cravings without all of the chocolate calories.<br /><br />Rather than dipping almonds into chocolate syrup or batter, the nuts are roasted with a lightly coated layer of chocolate powder. One ounce is only 150 calories, with only one gram of saturated fats, making this a healthy alternative to standard chocolate treats.<br /><br />The taste? Pleasant enough, but lacking the inherent richness one commonly associates with the tasty combo of chocolate and nuts, replaced in its stead by the fairly dry, pasty sensation of dipping whole nuts into instant hot chocolate mix. This means that Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds is a fairly satisfying nut snack, even if it is rather lacking as a chocolate one.<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but best washed down with a cold, or hot, glass of milk.","Somewhat dry, but a pleasant enough alternative to chocolate coated nuts...",3

"This cereal is very healthy (lots of fiber) but it sure doesn't taste very good! I don't understand the people who rave about the taste, maybe they've never tried a great tasting cereal before? Pretty much any cereal out there tastes better. Don't get me wrong, this is probably one of the healthiest cereal out there and one of the few that has Psyllium in it, but it sure doesn't taste very good. The cereal is all uniform ""pellets"", not crunchy at all.<br /><br />If you want to try good tasting cereal then give Bob's Red Mill's Honey Oatmeal cereal a try. That tastes 10 times better and is probably as healty as this one.<br /><br />If you're trying to solve digestive problems (that's probably why you consider a cereal with Psyllium in the first place), then try some ""Organic Smooth Move"" tea with Senna leafs. That helps with constipation issues.<br /><br />Bottom line, this cereal gets 10/10 for health, but 3/10 for taste. Before you buy the 6-pack based on all the raving reviews, make sure you buy one package first, to see if you like the taste. I pretty much wasted $24.

I also liked that it comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid with a small hole, rather than having to try to pour it out of the larger opening.

"The packaging for Kellogg's new CRUNCHY NUT cereal gives one the impression that it would be that company's version of the General Mills cereal, CHEERIOS, perhaps even the ""honey nut"" version. This cereal is much different, however. It is made of both corn and oats, and the corn flavor dominates. While there are some nut slivers on the rings, the nut flavor is overwhelmed by the cereal's sweetness, which tastes a great deal like the Kellogg's CORN POPS cereal. Further, the texture of the rings reminds me a great deal of Quaker Oats' CAP'N CRUNCH pieces, which is another corn/oats cereal. If you like a sugary, corn-flavored buzz, this cereal is for you. My personal preference is not for this kind of the cereal.

"I like this bar because it is healthy without tasting blah! It's nicely chewy and not as dry or tasteless as some ""health"" bars tend to be.  A nice combination of grains, coconut and chocolate make this a bar to reach for if you want a quick, easily packable snack that is not unhealthy. With that said, the calories are rather high: 180, and it includes 9 grams of fat, so you couldn't really call it a low-cal snack. I've often had one for breakfast as a kind of meal replacement when I'm in a hurry, with a glass of OJ and felt it satisfied me for a few hours, until lunch time. I like that it's gluten free, even though I don't actually have a gluten allergy that I know of.

I keep a supply in the refrigerator and, although I do not drink it every day, I find that it is a nice change from water or soda. The 8.4 oz. cans are just right, and they chill quickly. As others have pointed out, the flavor is much better cold than at room temperature.<br /><br />So would I buy it again? Maybe. My husband and I both thought it was ""OK."" We liked drinking it, but would not go out of our way to buy more. And we do not feel any sense of urgency to try other flavors.<br /><br />If you are looking for a somewhat healthier soda replacement, Izze may be a good choice. For juice, I will stick to plain, old-fashioned juice.","Blackberry has good flavor, but what's up with the fizz?",3

"I absolutely love ginger in every form - fresh, crystallized, powdered, ginger beer, etc. I was excited to try Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix. I filled the teakettle with purified water, poured the contents of the packet into my favorite mug, and waited for the whistle to sound. When the water was ready, I poured it into the mug and stirred until I could smell the aroma of sweet ginger filling the air. It doesn't get much better than this, I thought.<br /><br />I was wrong. I took my first sip and actually considered spitting it out because it was so over-the-top intense. I figured I had made a mistake in measuring out the water, so I grabbed a larger mug--very large--transferred the contents and poured in another 4-5 ounces of water. After another thorough stir, I took a taste and had the same reaction: this is too much! I let the mixture cool and put in some ice cubes to transform the stew into a cod drink. It didn't help.<br /><br />In the end, I determined that the makers of Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix have created a drink that will probably appear to ginger fanatics or health nuts. If you are in either of those camps, have at it. For the rest of us, a nice pouch of ginger tea will do quite nicely, thank you.",Mouth-puckeringly intense,3

"I like A&W root beer. Years ago our household had a blind taste test of the major root beers and we concluded A&W is the best tasting brand, by far, with a great creamy texture. So, if these frozen pops tasted like the beverage, I'd have rated them highly. Unfortunately, they do not. Somewhere in the translation from frothy, fizzy cold soda to flat, frozen stick, the essence of A&W was lost leaving an oddly flavored unenjoyable confection.<br /><br />Also these pops are much smaller than I think they should be or at least how I remember similar sleeve enclosed treats being.<br /><br />Having said all this, my children ran through these like ravenous monkeys, so maybe children's taste buds can find something to like.",Doesn't Taste Like A&W and Small,3

"While I enjoyed eating these chips, I doubt I would order them again.  The positives are that they are not too salty and they have a good, multigrain taste.  (I suppose this latter quality might be a minus for some who don't like the taste of whole grains.)  The negatives are that a fairly small serving size (one ounce) has 7 grams of fat because these chips are fried, not baked.  So while these are made using whole grains that aren't genetically modified, I'd hesitate to call them a healthful snack because of the high fat content.",multigrain taste and not too salty; too bad they are fried and not baked,3

I was already a big fan of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZU2"">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1-Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and was glad to see an organic version.  Unfortunately, though how much we tried to like this, the organic Zoe Organic EVOO just doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the non-organic variety.  This organic one definitely tastes like it's made from a whole different variety of olives, leaving it with a pronounced sharper, greener flavor with a bit of a bite.  It's very distinct, and totally overpowers my cooking.  The non-organic Zoe EVOO doesn't do this; it blends in perfectly as a marinade, for dipping bread, drizzling as a final touch on cooked dishes, etc.  So, unfortunately, in this case, go with the non-organic, which I have on Subscribe & Save reorder, and is a pantry staple in our house.",Regular Non-Organic Zoe EVOO tastes better,3

"The oatmeal itself is tasty and pretty healthful.  It's not the best oatmeal I've ever had, but it is quite good.  And it is great to see yet another vegan-certified product on the market.  This is a great option for busy vegans (like me!) looking for a quick breakfast.  You can probably make better oatmeal from scratch, but it would take a lot longer.  So, really, this is a good product.<br /><br />But I have two (somewhat related) complaints.<br /><br />First, the serving size is *ridiculously* small.  Each packet of oatmeal is about 120 calories.  That's just silly.  Unless you're a child, or you're planning on eating much more than oatmeal for breakfast (or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal), you'll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down.  That's a bit annoying.  (You could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups.  But they're a much worse value, calorie-for-dollar.  And the second problem, below, still applies.)<br /><br />Second, there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste.  It's absurd that ~50 ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes, each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmeal.<br /><br />These problems could be solved by just selling single-container bags of oatmeal.  The result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time serving.<br /><br />Still, overall, this is a good product.","Solid product and good value.  But, my goodness, too much waste!",3

"Like so many Americans I grew up eating quite a few varieties of Kellogg's cereals. The new ""Crunchy Nut"" cereal looked like it might be good so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />To make a long story short, it's tasty but it isn't anything like what I expected ... and isn't like what is pictured on the box.<br /><br />First, Kellogg's probably needs to get rid of the individual who came up with the idea of calling this cereal ""Crunchy Nut."" Besides the fact that it's unimaginative and blandly descriptive, if you tell your friends you just ate a bowl of ""Crunchy Nut"" you're going to get some pretty disgusted looks in return.<br /><br />Beyond the unfortunate name, as soon as you pour a bowl of Crunchy Nut you'll notice that none of the pieces look as ""nutty"" the the pieces shown on the box ... not even close. The box shows pieces of the cereal covered in small chips/chunks of nuts but the actual cereal just looks like fat Cheerios with the occasional ""speck"" of what might be best described as ""nut powder.""<br /><br />Once you actually taste this cereal you'll notice that it tastes almost exactly like Corn Pops (another Kellogg's brand cereal). My wife also tried a bowl of this cereal and the first thing she said (without any coaching from me) was, ""It tastes like Corn Pops."" This isn't a horrible thing as long as you like the flavor of Corn Pops cereal, but if you purchase this cereal expecting a burst of ""crunchy nut"" flavor then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a very tasty cereal (just like Corn Pops) but it has a horrible name, it doesn't look like the picture on the box, and it doesn't taste anything like the name suggests.","Tastes like ""Corn Pops"" and isn't very ""nutty.""",3

"My husband is a type II diabetic so we almost always eat whole grain pasta but sometimes you just gotta splurge a little and I'm always on the lookout for something I can have on hand that cooks fast.<br /><br />I fixed this as per the package directions except I used some diced, baked chicken that I already had in the freezer. This is easy to make. Just brown the chicken and then add the seasoning and pasta along with 2.5 cups of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 7 minutes then add the broccoli, cover and cook an additional 2-4 minutes.<br /><br />If you already have the cooked chicken available you could have dinner on the table in about 15 minutes! Even if you are cooking the chicken from raw, this is still a very quick meal.<br /><br />The first bite was almost too cheesy to me. I had some frozen chopped broccoli so I steamed about half a package of it and added it to the skillet. The taste improved quite a bit for me with the added benefit of more veggies.<br /><br />The downside to this meal is that about a cup of it is around 400 calories, 8 grams of fat. I plugged this into the weight watchers points calculator and it's 7 points per cup if you fix it as per the directions.<br /><br />This isn't something I could eat often but with the addition of extra broccoli and taking into consideration how good tasting/convenient it is, I would buy a couple of boxes to keep on hand for times when I don't have a lot of time to cook.",Good Taste but Be Careful if You're Counting Calories,3

When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.

"I purchased this brand as I wasn't so satisfied with the Kernel Seasons cheddar cheese. The reviews convinced me that this was the best on the market. As it is the ingredients and nutritional value are EXACTLY the same, number for number, word for word.. They must be made by the same manufacturer and packaged differently. So to sum it up --I paid $10.81 for 6.14 ounces as compared to buying 6 of the Kernel Seasons which would have come to $13.57 for 17.10 ounces.

No matter what sauces or dressings I use I seem to spice them up more anyway, so really this is just a base dressing and for that it's fine. I also use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK9CFE"">Newman's Own Salad Dressing, Caesar, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> in the same way--even though it's probably just meant to be a salad dressing.<br /><br />If you're lactose intolerant, read the label: most of these Taco Bell sauces contain milk-based whey and you might want to avoid it or take Lactaid with it. So far it hasn't bothered me.","Kind of an interesting taste, but nothing I crave",3

"When I first tried out the variety pack, this Winter Squash was one of the flavors that my twin babies instantly liked.  I started getting subscriptions for some of the flavors one at a time.  As they're getting bigger and eating more, I've added subscriptions.  We've run out at times and were forced to buy at the store, and I'm now determined to just keep those subscriptions going and not run out again.  I don't have a store nearby that beats the subscription price and with twins, I'm more than happy to get the packages delivered and have fewer errands. (As an aside, I'm personally beat and have learned even greater respect for parents in general.  With twins, one gets humbled in short order.  When I see how other parents manage, I'm always in awe at how good they are.)  The jars arrive very well packaged and I've never had any problems personally.  They come 12 in a box, the box is completely wrapped in lots bubble wrap so well that I need scissors to open the actual bubble wrap, and finally in a strong larger box.<br /><br />I have added this one knowing they like it and will readily eat it.  My other 4 oz. subscriptions are: carrots, lentil and rice, chicken dinner and sweet potato.  Soon I expect to add fruit flavors but the pediatrician advised to wait on fruit jars until they're just a little older and to start out with the vegetable ones.  The chicken dinner, which is really chicken with brown rice, was also advised but it has more squash than chicken.  When we ordered that, we crossed the threshold and departed from a vegetarian diet for our now 8+ month old babies.  We are not vegetarians but consume very little meat and poultry, so I guess our babies follow our personal guidelines, although as an ideal we'd eventually be vegetarians.  The only reason I didn't order the squash subscription earlier was that the chicken dinner has so much squash in it.<br /><br />What I've also discovered is that the features included in managing one's subscriptions (within My Account) are very good.  You can tell them you're out and want the next one sooner and several other options as well.  I've got several other subscriptions, such as baby formula and also some supplements for the adults in the household, and find the managing subscription feature very handy.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Organic winter squash, water necessary for processing.<br /><br />This has 40 calories, 5% protein, 100% vitamin A, 20% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.",Got the subscription.  My twins both like this one,3

Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.

"I know Macaroni and Cheese is supposed to be cheesy, but somewhere along the line this product became a bit too rich.

"I love Earl Grey. I love Zhena's Earl Green. I do not love Zhena's Earl ""Greater"" Grey: it is not greater. There's very little bergamot flavor, at least in the batch I got. In fact if I didn't know it's supposed to be Earl Grey I'd say it's only a fairly good black tea with no bergamot at all. Even just opening the tin, I got no whiff of bergamot, and certainly there's none in the finished tea, even using double tea bags. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but although it's passable tea, it's very bad Earl Grey.<br /><br />For real Earl Grey, I strongly recommend The Republic of Tea's ""Earl Greyer.""

Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food seems to be a run of the mill grocery store pet food made by Purina with a yummy package photo to attract the humans who purchase these products.<br /><br />The ingredient list certainly has a lot of grains which can be viewed as cheap fillers to boost the profit margin for the manufacturer and not the nutrition value of the pet food.

"I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors, but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor.","so-so flavor, too much fiber for me",3

"When I saw this shampoo available to Amazon Vine reviewers, I requested a bottle. After a horrible color treatment years ago that burned my scalp and forever changed not only the amount of hair on my head but its texture as well, I'm always interested in shampoos said to be good for hair ""prone to breakage."" The fine print, though, indicates that the shampoo does all these great things, including restoring the scalp's natural moisture balance, only when used in conjunction with the conditioner, which was not sent to me.<br /><br />After using the shampoo and my existing conditioner for a couple of weeks, I bought the Strong Lengths conditioner. I've used it a few times, and so far there's not much to report. My scalp does seem slightly less itchy than it is prone to, but then again, it's not wintertime, when the heater runs nearly constantly and dries out my skin and scalp. I've not discovered the oiliness from using the shampoo that other reviewers have reported, but oily hair is not an issue for me in general. Neither the shampoo nor conditioner are expensive, so buying the conditioner as well wasn't a hardship, but I disliked the asterisk about needing both the shampoo and conditioner to experience the shampoo's true efficacy.<br /><br />I plan to report back in a few more weeks about how well both products work together, but I can't say much about how the shampoo works on its own. Yes, it cleanses my hair as promised, but if it's being nourished, the jury's still out.",The Jury's Still Out,3
"My cats loved this tuna.  No complaints at all about the quality and taste from them.  But two issues I have with it is it's not really a treat and it's not convenient to give to your cat for a little snack.  It's three rather large slabs of tuna that need to go in a bowl. The slabs are pretty densely packed and could probably be formed into smaller pieces, so I'm not sure why they aren't.  When you open it you are inevitably going to get tuna juice on your hands and it's a bit messy all around.  It's really more of a meal.<br /><br />Another thing is the price is too high.  It's higher than even good canned tuna you can buy in the grocery store.  I'm not sure why I would buy this over just buying my cats a can of tuna from time to time.  If I had tons of money I guess I would buy this?  I'm not sure.  It just seems like a waste of money.","Great quality, but price too high",3
"I'm a single guy in my mid-50's. I like to work-out and stay in shape.  During the week, I drink bottled water and non-sugar fruit juices. I like the Izze Natural Juice. It's tangy, and full of Vitamin C and Vitamin b6(a helpful ingredient for good disposition). There's no sugar, no caffine, and no preservatives. This flavor has apple, grape, and pineapple. cool. My only gripe is it comes in a can. I like Diet Snapple because it's in a bottle. Something about metal cans. I drink Red Bull, but not for the taste.",Tasy Fruity,3

"There seem to be several new products on the market lately that are designed to enhance the flavor of water. Personally, I think water tastes just fine the way it is, but since I'm also a tea drinker (in mass quantity) I thought I'd try this. It's OK, it's fine, I have no complaints about the taste, though it's a bit on the too sweet side. The taste is kind of familiar and I'm not really sure what it reminds me of, but it tastes a bit like a melted popsicle or like Jello. In fact, it tastes a lot like licking jello powder off of your fingers, come to think of it--which is to say that it's not a bad taste by any means, and kids will probably like it. Also, if like me you drink too much sugar, you might want to give this a try mixed with club soda or seltzer--I imagine it would be good that way. One packet only has five calories. Would I go out of my way to buy it? Probably not, but you never know :) I'm going to try making ice cubes from it next :)",Tastes like a melted popsicle :),3

"I may not do much well, but people have complemented me on my coffee for over 40 years. I like a strong, rich coffee but hate the acidy taste that some coffees have. I've been grinding fresh beans for about 25 years, instead of grinding them at the store or buying ground coffee. I think it makes the coffee taste a little fresher and with less acid.<br /><br />I served the Melitta Classique Supreme Ground Coffee to guests last Sunday and everyone really liked the rich taste and I didn't have to make it stronger; I measured it properly and got a really rich coffee. It is good but... I can taste a slight hint of acidy after taste that I don't get with my Starbucks beans.<br /><br />I'd say that, if you don't grind your coffee bean before brewing each pot, then this coffee is as good or better than most ground coffees.

"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.

"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).

The dry tea didn't have much of a smell either- it did smell barely of dried flowers.<br /><br />The color is nice- a deep and clear red, and the flavor is ok- but I found the sourness is more appealing to me as an iced tea drink.<br /><br />I also like to put skim milk in my tea, and I don't recommend doing that, since the acidity/sourness of the tea caused it to curdle.<br /><br />The printing on the bag seemed faded, and the other reviews mention difference in bags that the tea comes in.  This particular shipment was in the fold down bag, not the zip-lock bag, like some of their other teas.  This makes me think that they are either gradually changing over to the new bags, and I got an old bag of tea- or they are inconsistent with rotating their product.<br /><br />I look forward to trying a couple more hibiscus teas that are out there so I know more about the way that it is supposed to taste.",Thought I would give this tea a try,3

"The original Hit cookies had an almost-nutella creme center sandwiched by crispy cookies. This is sort of the reverse.

"Eight O'Clock French Roast whole bean is a big step above Folgers and other supermarket coffee. But if you like Starbucks or Peets you'll be disappointed. It's nowhere close to the full rich bold flavor and smell (some would say burned but I like it) of these two (and some other local coffeehouses where they roast their own beans).<br /><br />To me, Folgers-type coffees have a thin bitter aftertaste. Eight O'Clock has a bit of that though not bad. However, the beans don't look freshly roasted and don't have a strong aroma when first opening the bag. They look only slightly oily and light brown. Not the dark oily look of fresh Starbucks or Peets beans. I doubled the amount of coffee I usually use to brew and the flavor isn't bad, just not rich and strong.<br /><br />** Update 4/20/10 ** I tried mixing these coffee beans with Starbucks beans. The resulting coffee is a big improvement over Eight O'Clock alone and slightly mellows the Starbucks.<br /><br />** Update 7/2/10 ** I just tried the Italian Dark Roast and found it slightly better, with darker and more oily beans. Perhaps this is due to all four bags being properly vacuum sealed, unlike the French Roast batch I received.","Ok, but not great",3

"I have been using Natural Balance food rolls for over a year as a food topper.

We call them the dogs' ""sprinkles.""<br /><br />I had not tried the beef flavor yet and thought the dogs would appreciate a change of pace. Unfortunately our routine is out of whack now. When put into a food processor and ground, this food roll turns into a paste and sticks to itself, basically turning into a solid again. We cannot just ""sprinkle"" it on top of food.

I soon got tired of these cereal bars and half of the box still exists (it was only me eating them).<br /><br />They are very very sweet and there's more of the sweet jam filling than the multigrain wrap. If you do not have much of a sweet tooth (like me) I do not recommend getting these. And if you really want them, buy the individual boxes in stores. They may be a bit more pricey if you count the individual cost, but you get more choices of flavors and there's only 8 bars per box so you wont end up with a ton left over when you finally get sick of them.

This is a perfect example -- while the Newman's folks probably liked it, it just doesn't do much for me. It's too sweet for my taste (though that may be more a factor of the 54% cacao content -- I'm used to more), and it has a weird solventy aftertaste to it that just ruins it for me.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy it.

"This was a pretty good idea -- it's basically juice from concentrate that's been reconstituted with sparkling instead of plain water.  As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice.  The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's.  Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink.  Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product.  And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors.  At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff.  One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much.  The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than cherry juice.  This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case all three tastes are really noticeable.  It tastes as much like apple juice or grape juice as it does cherry juice.  (The apple and grape flavors stand out more in the Switch Black Cherry drink than in the Switch Kiwi Berry drink.  If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you like all three, then you might like this.  If there's one you don't like, that could be enough to ruin it for you.","Not bad, but it should be called ""The Switch Apple, Grape & Black Cherry""",3

"I've eaten so much ramen in the past year due to not having a car on campus. It's easier to just buy a bunch in case i ever out of food  and won't starve when it's snowing outside.<br />I decided to buy some online to find a better variety than just the chicken, beef or shrimp they offer at the store.<br />I thought it would be thinner noodles but its not. The sauce packet (powder) tastes like worcestershire sauce like the reviews say, but thats all i tasted. The seaweed flakes didn't go so well for me either. There is a slight spice which is usual with the worcestshire. Personally it was just lacking something and wasn't all that appetizing.<br />I will try adding ingredients and see how that goes.

"If you like iced coffee, you will probably prefer to continue drinking your favorite iced brand.  While I found this a bit too strong, it does have a better, less bitter flavor than most canned coffees, and the metallic taste I often notice in canned coffees is very light here.  For the money, I would not purchase it in this manner.  It's rather expensive for the small sized cans.  For someone who just likes an occassional iced coffee treat at home, it may be a good choice.","A Bit Too Strong for Me, but Tastier Than Most Canned Coffees",3

"Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.

"If you're in a situation where you wanted to bring coffee with you, but were somehow prevented from bringing a thermos or Starbucks cup, I suppose you could do worse than this canned coffee. That's basically all it is: lightly sweetened canned coffee. The can is small enough to fit in a bag or purse, and there's just enough here for ""one cup of coffee,"" as it were. It's meant to be drank cold, but for me coffee drinks are better served hot unless they've got lots of flavor and sugar in them. This one is just canned coffee, and it's good enough as that, but not much more.","Okay, but just canned coffee",3

"I love the taste of ginger - in foods, soda, dried and jam. The thought of a refreshing and relaxing ginger drink aroused my interest. My single sample arrived in a huge box. The ""green"" in me cringed; first warning. Then the packet had only the instruction of ""mixing with 250 ml of water"". Second warning.  How long should I steep it? no idea. When the drink was, what I thought was ready,i.e. mixed with the correct amount of hot water, I tried it - wow, the ginger taste was intense! I added 1/2 again the amount of water and reheated it. This was better, but still very powerful. I went back to the packaging to see the make-up of the product -no information was provided; a description of some of the ingredients does come on the full supply box but I did not have that to see. (I went back to the listing for this fact). Strike three. Then I checked the caloric content - still no details. Maybe that is on the box, but that was nowhere to my knowledge.

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is ""All-Natural with Vitamins,"" that there is only ""1 calorie in every 10 licks"" and that there are ""over 500 licks per bottle.""  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week.",Potentially messy but my dog loves it.,3
"This is a hard review to write based off the fact that every pack is different and has a different taste and different good / bad things about each.<br /><br />I bought this package so that I can try them out and see which ones I liked.<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because I liked 3 of them a lot and the other 2 were OK, and 1 of them was just straight up UN UH!<br /><br />So...for the most part, I am 98.9999% vegan. But on occasion I will have some cheese, butter, and milk here and there if they are included in something that I did not make myself. That being said, when I am 'bad' I want it to be GOOD! However...I honestly like the taste of the ones without the dairy products so much better.<br /><br />And I am Italian, so I definitely used to have a special place in my heart for cheese, but the cottage cheese ones were kinda off.<br /><br />The mashed vegetable one (which contains butter) was just ok.<br /><br />So to review, in order...best to least:<br /><br />Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Cu<br />Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry<br />Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry<br />Jpav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry<br /><br />Notice I didn't place Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese on the list?? That's because it was NASTY! Definitely didn't like this one. I mean, It wasnt so bad that I threw it away. I still ate it, but I wont ever buy the Spinach one again.<br /><br />Don't let me sway your decision to buy Kitchens of India products though. The ones I did like tasted better than most Indian restaurants I have been to. And I've been to quite a few. Not to mention it is much cheaper than going out to a restaurant by far!<br /><br />And if you live on the north eastern USA and have a Wegmans near you, they just started making different kinda of packaged Naan breads which are also very good (they are not vegan though sadly).<br /><br />I've ordered a 6 pack of the Kidney Bean curry, lentil curry, and chick pea curry because I liked them so much. And thankfully out of the 6 choices in this multi pack, the 3 that I like the best have the lowest amount of fat and sodium, which seem to be very high in all of Kitchens of India products. Especially the Sodium. So be careful, and eat them in moderation as I do.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",3 YUMS + 3 UMMMMS?? = 3 STARS,3

"Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.","Good, but not great",3

"When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.","good, but not great",3

I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun.

"The happy news:  Wednesday was 100 degrees and I felt exhausted and unable to focus on the 90-mile drive.  Experimented with 1 bottle of Orange at 2 p.m.  It tasted awful.  At first it had no effect, and I did find some relief by pouring water on the back of my neck and back to revive me.  I continued driving and I would say about half-way (45 min) I no longer felt like I had a problem with tiredness or my driving.

At 9:15 p.m. I began to feel my usual tired self, then normal drowsing and fell asleep without issue.<br /><br />During the night I awoke feeling like my skin was crawling without anything specific to scratch.  I am guessing that this is a generalized itching sensation from ""niacin flush.""<br /><br />The unhappy news:  Wednesday was also the day the three tornadoes hit Massachusetts so I cannot say for sure whether what happened the days after was from the 5-Hour Energy or from my adrenaline kicking in from pure worry.

Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product.","Dogs love them, but I don't think they love dogs",3

"All my dogs reacted badly to this food.  They seemed to like the taste but it gave them diarrhea.  I gave it a while but saw no improvement.  However, they are now on Castor & Pollux's Organix, and I've never had such a great experience with a food.  The ingredients are high quality and their stool is now perfect every time - much easier pick-up for me!  So Castor has good products, just this one didn't work for me.

"Recently my grocer stopped carrying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XIZMQ"">Mahatma Saffron Yellow Rice</a> so I decided to try Goya Spanish Style Yellow rice.<br /><br />Goya comes in a box, but is prepared much the same as the other yellow rices.  You bring 2 cups of water to boil, add 1 tablespoon of oil (or butter) and the rice packet.  You then boil for one minute and then reduce the heat, for 25 minutes.<br /><br />The result was a flavorful, fairly fluffy rice which my family liked.  My husband in particular liked it, and commented that is seemed less salty than the other brands -- 860mg per 45 grams or 1/4 cup.  And it was certainly good with the Kielbasa I served it with.<br /><br />Those with allergies to MSG take note.  This product has it.  In addition, the manufacturer uses Yellow Dye #5, and the rice MAY also contain, milk, egg, wheat, soybean, tree nuts, crustacean and fish bits, which freaks me out a bit, because it sounds like they have no production control at all.<br /><br />So, though tasty, we won't be purchasing Goya Yellow Rice again because of the MSG, the Yellow chemical dye, and because of the possibility that it might be contaminated with nuts :(<br /><br />Not Kosher.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/allergy sufferer and principle cook<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:::<br />Rice Long Grain Parboiled ( Iron, Niacin, Thiamine (Thiamin), Folic Acid (Vitamin aB) ), Chicken Bouillon ( Soy Protein Hydrolyzed, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate, Sugar, Maltodextrin, Flavor(s) Chicken ( Soy Protein Hydrolyzed, Salt, Chicken Fat, Yeast Extract, Flavor(s) Natural, Silicon Dioxide Added To Prevent Caking, Chicken Powder, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Guanylate ), Soy Protein Hydrolyzed, Soybean(s) Oil Hydrogenated, Onion(s), Yeast Extract, Chicken Fat ( Chicken Fat Rendered, Annatto, BHA, BHA, Celery, Chicken ( Citric Acid ), Citric Acid ), Pepper(s) Bell Dehydrated, Onion(s) Dehydrated, Garlic, Garlic, Milk Non-Fat Dry Solids, Parsley, Propyl Gallate, Propyl Gallate, Salt, Silicon Dioxide Added To Prevent Caking, Yellow 5, Chicken Cooked, Silica, Coriander<br /><br />MAY CONTAIN::<br />Milk, egg, wheat, soybean, tree nuts, crustacean shell fish, and fish.",Tasty... but has MSG,3

"I sampled Kali Ginger and Lemon drink mix on a cold wintry day when my throat was a bit inflamed and sore.  I drank it hot as directed on the foil pouch.  To be honest, the first few sips burned quite a bit as they went down due to the ginger, but as I continued to drink, the lemon and honey flavors came to the fore.  After finishing the whole cup, my throat felt a little bit better, and I realized that overall, I had liked the beverage.<br /><br />That said, the big question is: did I like it well enough to order more?  And my honest answer is: probably not.  Gold Kali Ginger & Lemon is one of those products that I might enjoy on a rare occasion, but not one that I'm tempted to stock up on and make part of my regular diet.

The carbonation isn't overly done, so it has some fizz, but not like a soda, which is also good.<br /><br />It contains 100% daily RDA for several things, including vitamin C, but then no one drinks an energy drink to ward off the common cold.  The true test is the energy boost, and for No Fear I found little of that.  Actually, all I really got was a headache (I am not caffeine sensitive.  I don't drink energy drinks daily, but I have had them about once a week without headaches.).

"Campbell's Chunky Beef with Country Vegetables (BCV) is my favorite, but this was such a good deal on subscribe and save that I decided to try it as an alternative.

It's okay--I'll be finishing all the cans--but every time I open one I wish I just bought BCV instead.<br /><br />A note about Campbell's Chunky soups in general... they all have their names ""mixed up"" and you should swap what is before and after the ""with"" in the name to know what to expect in the can (e.g., BCV is really more like ""Country Vegetables with Beef"").

Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine.

The back camera is kind of decent in daylight, but is quite bad when its dark. The front camera is a wide angle, does great job most of the time. Being an old design, this tab does not also have very nice speakers.

"This is the 3rd conditioner from CLEAR SCALP & HAIR that I have tried recently.  The first one didn't do anything for my hair, the second was an improvement and I continue to use it and this one is even better than that.<br /><br />With this conditioner I have been using it every other day for close to two weeks.  If I use it daily it makes my hair to oily, but on the other schedule it leaves it soft and feeling moisturized.  It rinses well and also doesn't weigh my hair down, which is good for my naturally curly hair.  Additionally I have had less problem with frizziness which is great here in the Northwest. One last note is I do like the smell of it; although because it rinses well it doesn't linger as much on my hair as I would like.<br /><br />Overall for the price I am happy with this conditioner and will continue to use it in a rotation with other conditioners that work well for my hair.","Inexpensive, but leaves my hair soft and feeling healthier.",4

"The selling point for this energy drink over others is that it has a ""brand new taste."" I suppose if one wants something different from the taurine/B complex flavors of the Red Bull and Monster, then it definitely does taste different, and sweeter and fruitier. Others report grape juice flavor; I also think there's some watermelon flavor in there too. It certainly doesn't taste bad, and I don't detect any chemical or other aftertaste. I still do prefer my classic energy drinks, but I have no regrets about trying this one out.<br /><br />The bottom line is, if you need a kick and don't like Red Bull and Monster, and coffee's not your thing either, you might want to give No Fear a try.",Can't taste the taurine,4

"Great tasty product and great price, but Roland has a packaging problem with the pail which had cracked and seemed too weak for the contents.<br /><br />The top of the pail was completely snapped off and the protective foil seal burst open during transit - the entire glaze contents spilled out like slime - Fed-X wrapped the box in a plastic bag to prevent further leakage. There was adequate bubble wrap from Amazon, but the box they used for shipping was too big and the pail had room to smash around inside the box. So, this is an EXCELLENT product, but Roland's plastic pail is just too thin.  Amazon is looking into the issue - I sure hope they resolve it!  And then I'll gladly order again.  By the way, Amazon's customer service Rocks - they are the best company to deal with when things go kapooey!<br /><br />** UPDATE: Ordered another one a few months later and it arrived in perfect condition with much better packaging.  It looks like Amazon resolved the shipping issue. Order with confidence.",Great product but it majorly leaked during shipment,4

"I don't think honeycomb gets a better taste than this.  I'd give it 5 stars but for a couple minor things: 5 ounce packages (in a quantity of 4) are too small.  I want bigger.  Secondly, they seal it the best they can, but these little containers tend to leak--not a lot, just at a nuscience level.  Lastly--this is Amazon's fault--I arranged per their automatic delivery plan to get shipments every two months.  That will not be often enough and I absolutely can not figure out how to change it.  I wonder if it is even possible.  Perhaps they will be mailing them the rest of my life at 2 month intervals!",Delicious,4

"Normally when it comes to organic foods I have the same reaction that people who eat them have to non-organic foods; namely a reaction of ""keep that stuff well away from me, thanks."" Organic farming is inefficient and the end product isn't any better nutritionally or taste-wise than non-organic foods.<br /><br />That out of the way, I really enjoyed this! The chocolate taste is good, and not overwhelming, and the bits of berries really add something nice, even if they do have somewhat of an odd texture. I do imagine that you can probably find something that's just as good for cheaper, if you're willing to go the non-organic route. These do strike me as a little pricey.<br /><br />But price aside this is a dandy product and oh-so good!","Crunchy, tasty, yummy, good!",4

"Co-workers introduced me to instant Ginger tea. I've purchased a few different brands locally. I prefer the instant in this case because tea-bag varieties I've tried tend to lack flavor and be quite tame. I like my ginger with a kick to it!<br /><br />Gold Kili's Ginger-Lemon drink has that kick, though it isn't the strongest I've tasted. That honor goes to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035UI0H2"">Instant Crystal Honey Ginger Tea</a>.  The Gold Kili brand drink is almost as strong, yet its sweetness has a slightly artificial flavor. Not totally off-putting, but noticeable. The lemon flavor is there too, but very subdued. I prefer the honey taste of the other brand.<br /><br />The Gold Kili instant ginger drink can handle more than 6-8 oz. of liquid without tasting watered down, and I recommend 10-12 for most folks.  I can see it mixing well in various cocktails as well. Medicinal effects of ginger are well documented, though I don't know how effective they are in this formulation. Just be mindful that this is an instant beverage and not the same as one made with fresh ingredients. You get it for the convenience.<br /><br />3.5 stars for a tasty ginger drink.<br /><br />~ Kort",Decent Instant Ginger Tea,4

"This is a pretty good gluten-free bread, but in my family's view, not as super delicious as Pamela's.  I like this bread for a basic sandwich bread--it has a decent texture and no strong or off flavors.  And rises to a nice size.  However, I found it to be much dryer than Pamela's GF bread mix.  I'm not sure what the solution to the dryness is--I'm going to try the strategies other reviewers recommended about putting olive oil on the top or adding applesauce to the mix.  (Note, though, that even though I say this loaf is somewhat dry, that's in comparison to Pamela's; Namaste is far moister than the typical Bread For Life, Kinnikinnick premade breads.  So it's a huge improvement over those and worth making just for that reason).  Note that it is also much less sweet than Pamela's bread, which my children eat like candy when I cut it open warm.  Thus, it may be better for people who have diabetic concerns (I'm just guessing, but Pamela's bread is VERY sweet).  Note that I've tested both breads only by using a bread maker.  The breads worked beautifully that way.",Pretty Good Bread,4

"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.",3 out of 4 Paws,4

"I'm so glad I've found a healthier alternative to Cheerios. My 18 month loves Cheerios but I wanted to find a healthier version.<br /><br />The new recipe is great. It only has 1 gram of sugar per serving and it no longer contains corn.  Last year when I first tried it, it contained 3 grams of sugar per serving. I didn't like how sweet it tasted so I stopped buying it. Then I came across a review about the new recipe so I decided to research it. Seeing the new nutritional label here on Amazon, I decided to give it another try. Glad I did. Now my only complaint is it contains more sodium than Cheerios, hence the 4 stars rating. Cheerios has 160 grams while Cascadian Farms has 190 grams per servings.<br /><br />Ingredients: *Whole Grain Oats, *Whole Grain Barley, *Wheat Starch, *Malted Barley Extract, Sea Salt, *Oats, * Malted Barley, Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols)<br /><br />Vitamins and Minerals: Calcium Carbonate, Zinc and Iron (mineral nutrients), A B Vitamin (niacinamide), Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) A B Vitamin (folic acid)",Healthier alternative to Cheerios!,4

"Starbucks Via will not replace a well-crafted hand-brewed cup of coffee from your favorite coffee shop, but it's a hell of a lot better than what you probably expect instant coffee to taste like.<br /><br />If your experience with instant coffee stops at Taster's Choice or Folgers, be prepared to be wowed. Those products produce a result that tastes and looks like water with some coffee flavoring. Starbucks Via is much more like a ""real"" cup of coffee.<br /><br />Another advantage of Via is that the packets are soluble in cold or tepid water, so it's possible to mix yourself a glass of iced coffee right away, rather than having to brew and then cool coffee first.<br /><br />At about $1 per cup, it's certainly less expensive than fresh-brewed Starbucks coffee, though it's still more expensive than brewing coffee at home using a drip maker, french press or whatever other process you prefer. But for when you're on the run or on the road, it's quite a serviceable and enjoyable cup of coffee without too much muss and fuss. I bring Via packets with me when I travel, for example, and keep them on hand for when I'm not in the mood or don't have the time to brew a whole pot.",Quite a good cup of instant coffee,4

Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.<br /><br />Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.<br /><br />The other important thing is the list of ingredients.

"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.<br /><br />Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda.

HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (green beans, pears, and peas) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with spinach you would think the color would be closer to a green rather than just pear/mango. i've made tons of baby food at home and anything with a good amount of spinach (since they place it first and list it first on the FRONT, but the ingredients show otherwise) turns green! i suppose they keep it to a small amount to avoid deterring kids by the color.<br />in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!",both kids love it!,4

"I have gone through several <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018N1DRW"">KONG Naturals Premium Catnip, 2-Ounce</a> jars.  Looking for a bit more value, I decided to try Cosmic Catnip.  I don't typically like to change a good thing but went with it. I have house cats and also care for some free-roaming cats. Both populations react favorably to the product. For the house cats, I sprinkle some in their cat beds and on their toys and they roll around, sometimes head over heels. It is quite amusing to watch. However, I think the cats are more interested in the Kong product; they seem to spend greater periods of time playing with it and sniffing it.  In my house, that means more exercise and that is something I like to promote.<br /><br />Cosmic's catnip is packaged in a #3 plastic container, which is not as easily recyclable as a #1 or #2 plastic in most areas. The product's packaging also indicates that it is grown in North America, so that may mean outside of the United States. (For the record, Kong's catnip comes in a #1 PETE container that is easily recyclable and its catnip is also grown in North America).<br /><br />Would I purchase it again?  My cats like it but there is no reason to use a container that is only sometimes recyclable for catnip.  Additionally, my cats liked the Kong product a bit more.  I will likely stick with that when it is time to repurchase.",The cats prefer Kong but this will do,4

"Ok let me clarify first of all, why I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5.<br /><br />If it were to up to me alone, this food is 5/5.<br />The ONLY reason why I took 1 star off, is because my dogs hate the taste :(<br />I have a Pomeranian and a Maltese. Both of them would often just sniff the food, and walk away. They will eventually eat it when they are really hungry, but they just look very disinterested in the food overall. I have the same issue with Blue Buffalo.<br />However, when I alternate them to Orijen, or Taste of the Wild, or Acana, or Fromm, they pretty much gobble them down instantly. (I tend to alternate around different brands and flavors just to make sure they are not deficient in a specific nutrient/mineral).<br />This *small* problem is NOT universal. I have friends whose dogs love this food, and I have seen dogs that absolutely won't touch Wellness. Every dog has its preferences, so its best to experiment around.<br /><br />However, I like feeding my dogs WELLNESS most.<br />Their poop is solid and doesn't stink, and based upon the ingredients list, it seems really good!<br />No by-products<br />No corn<br />No fillers (well except for tomato pomace, which some people consider it as a filler. I personally don't)<br />Omega 3 and 6 levels are on the higher side (which is a big plus!) compared to other brands/foods!!! ^_^<br /><br />I have fed about 2 bags so far, and my dogs haven't had any health problems.<br /><br />Only thing I wish the product can improve, is to maybe include Chicken Fat, instead of using Canola Oil. That will probably make the taste much better for my dogs making them much more interested in it. Canola oil is a cheaper alternative, but its really not a biggie.<br /><br />This is definitely something I recommend to include in your feeding rotation!<br /><br />On the sidenote: if you do not want to risk having a 15 pound bag of food that your dog hates, contact Wellness for a sample! They will send a 4oz packet to you, so you can ""test"" if your dog likes it.",One of the best dog food you can buy for the price,4

"Great product.  I was looking for a way to use my coffee in my krueig machine (by cuisinart) with out having to use the supplied filter.  Let's face it, the whole point is to make a cup of coffee using the k-cup and not have to fill the little filter, then clean it afterwards.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  I was looking for this type of item and hoping that I could pre-package my brand of coffee. I was skeptical at first, but thought for the price, I'd give it a try AND the product works GREAT.  I fill up the 50 cups with the filter, lid and store it in an old K-cup box.  The lids fit tight and it works just like the more expensive k-cups. The only issue is that on my 12 cup setting, there is a little spill over, but there are no problems with the 10 cup setting.  Once in a while when you open the top to put in another cup, it will stick to the top of the machine where the hole punctures the cup, but that's in once in a while.  In fact I am about to purchase again.  I only wish the shipping wasn't as much as the product.  It arrived earlier than scheduled I believe.

With only 30 pill pockets in each 7.9oz pouch, I'll definitely have to buy in bulk.

"If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine.",The puppy loves this!,4

"If you're used to that cola from Atlanta or in the red white and blue can from New York, you're probably going to be disappointed with the taste.<br /><br />But is it an acceptable cola as colas go? Yes. I'd even say as a mixer, it'd be fine. There is a heavy aftertaste of carmelized sugar, and that does impact the taste of the cola itself but it is drinkable even if the folks used to Atlanta's finest despise it. Muddy it up with something like flavored syrup (cherry, vanilla, etc) or Rum and it isn't as noticeable.<br /><br />Also remember that with cola and other ""dark"" syrups, you have to increase the level of carbonation. I typically do 4-5 buzzes for the right amount of fizz.<br /><br />I'd put it above the tea taste of the Natural root beer as it's drinkable but still below the lemon/lime and Ginger Ale Natural flavors.",Not your usual cola.,4

"I am new to sprouting.  The Sproutmaster gets great reviews from other exclusive sprouting sites.  I like the design and the stack-ability.  I have sprouted twice in it so far, and both times my sprouts got white mold on them and had to be tossed.  I am doing something wrong and will need to do some more research.  I would like for the directions to address this problem, but they do not.  I bought this to replace my jar method, which did not mold, but I have yet to learn the ""technique.""  If you know what you are doing, I'm sure it is great.  I know the first time I sprouted, it molded because I had the bottom upside down and there was no ventilation.

"My husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  He loves this product and since I only really make the pancakes I can't say how the other Bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.  And yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  So I am happy he likes this one!  With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you don't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.  It may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  Good product and great results!  Thank you, Bisquick!",Good stuff!!!!!,4

"First let me state that I've only tried 3 flavors so far (chocolate coconut, cocoa mole', and apple pie).<br /><br />I found chocolate coconut to be my least favorite. Normally I like the chocolate coconut combination, but in this brand it just didn't work for me!  If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!",Yummy G/F Alternative!,4

I actually like the original flavor better, but since these were cheaper, I went with it.<br /><br />I've seen these with cheaper prices at asian supermarkets when it's on sale, but if you ""subscribe"" to this on amazon, it's worth an extra dollar or two not to make a trip to the market. When I cook these, I usually add an egg, some veggies, and leftover meat (or whatever is in the fridge). The seafood flavor packet is strong so it adds lots of flavor to everything else.<br /><br />When I got these delivered, none of my ramen were crushed, so it really depends on how carefully your delivery company treats the boxes.

"I really like hot cocoa!  I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!<br /><br />Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  Each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugar-free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you.","Not bad, not bad at all",4

"Had come across a number of comments mentioning that the taste isn't the same as it used to be.<br /><br />I don't know how it tasted previously, but the contents of this packaging are perfectly fine in taste. I found that cooling the contents a bit tasted much better than consuming them at room temperature or chilling them.<br /><br />Also, the contents contain more sodium than water but, then again, you derive maximum benefit from coconut water if you use it as protection against dehydration or for replenishment, and not as a substitute for regular water. Also, drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade seemed to make me feel more bloated - so far, I have experienced nothing of that sort with Zico. Admittedly, carrying a Powerade bottle to the gym looks much more normal than carrying a Zico coconut water bottle :-)<br /><br />For what it's worth, my mom-in-law suffers from hyperacidity and has found the Natural variant of ZICO to be a blessing.<br /><br />I didn't give this 5 stars because I haven't been consuming it for long to know what side effects there might be, and nothing beats real coconut water, right out of a tropical coconut.",Pretty good,4

"My family went to eating all whole grains several years ago while doing the South Beach diet. We gave up mac and cheese reluctantly and tried several ""other"" brands to satisfy the craving. None could compete. If you grew up on Kraft mac 'n' cheese with the bright yellow might-be-cheese sauce, you miss it.  My daughter loves mac but would only get it at ""Grandma's"" house because I didn't keep it around much.  I was excited to find out about this product, but only to find no local stores who carried it. Thank you, Amazon! It is well worth the price and tastes just like the original, just with a stronger wheat flavor.  I felt the cheese sauce should be made a little stronger to compensate for the strong wheat flavor of the pasta. We don't mind the wheat taste, but some other people aren't as fond of it. If you don't care for the taste of whole wheat pasta, this probably isn't for you. We, however, will definitely reorder.",Good price. Good product. Not too grainy for whole grain,4

"With a 50 pound boxer/pit, finding an effective and lasting treat is a bit of a challenge. My playful, lovable monster can routinely destroy pillows, blankets, and kong bars with the greatest of ease. So I tossed her one of these, expecting it to be demolished within minutes.<br /><br />And she put it in her mouth, spit it out, and looked confused for a few minutes. A day later, I tried again. Same result. The day after that? Finally she bit into it, cracking its exterior and devoured whatever was inside. Now that she's figured out what to do with them, these actually have some use - preventing the rest of our house from being her chew toy.<br /><br />This is definitely something made for larger dogs. The exterior of the MiniCongo is rigid and bone-like, so much so that I think only large dogs could really break into these suckers effectively. If you have a pup or a toy dog, I wouldn't recommend them. Our little monster has a delicate stomach and so far I can't attribute any mood changes / digestive changes to this. Not a bad little product, provided your dog is smart / large enough to really get their teeth around them!",Confusing at first...,4

"When it comes to dog food, as you can see with the many reviews on Purina Chef Michael's products, you have passionate pet owners who are concerned about their dogs health and feeding them the best food possible.<br /><br />I admire pet owners who can do just that, as I know many who prefer to cook their dogs meal to those who will splurge in order to make sure their dogs eat the best and are healthy.  But with today's economy, I also know that there are owners who can't cook, can't splurge and try to look for the best price that they can to feed their dog(s).<br /><br />Purina's Chef Michels brand sounds like gourmet food for the dogs.  But looking at the price, how can gourmet food be so cheap?  Well, for the Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor dog food which comes with potato & green bean garnishes, there is no doubt that many dogs will eat it.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate and many more.<br /><br />My small adult Pug-tzu's love eating this dry dog food.  It's small and at first they sniffed it but after 10 minutes or so, they began scarfing it down.  I did mix it with other dog food but on its own, I'm sure they enjoy it.  And what I like about it is that Amazon offers it for under $10, Purina does say they use real beef and the crunchy kibbles includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Granted, after eating this, they also tend to have more stools.  I also want to note that my dogs did not produce any horrid flatulence after eating this dog food, like others have reported.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm not an erudite when it comes to what is healthy for dogs and what isn't.  There are many reviews from hardcore dog lovers that you can read on this product to know that many have chimed in and called this ""junk food"" for their dogs.<br /><br />But I also feel that there are many people out there who are dog owners who can't afford to pay so much for their dog's food and the price of this dry dog food is quite appealing.  Purina does claim this particular Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dry dog food does include 23 essential vitamins and nutrients.<br /><br />So, for the pet owners who are very budget-conscious, are looking for dry dog food that their small dogs will enjoy but also getting the essential vitamins in their meal, then Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food may be for you.","You're dogs will love it, owners will love it for the price but it may not be the healthiest...",4

"Lipton even kind of realizes that it isn't really to be used for onion soup, what with the ""recipe secrets"" branding and all. Because one ends up with a lot of it, when buying from in bulk packs I did once try it as a soup and it was awful, but as a recipe helper it really is hard to beat.<br /><br />As a helpful hint you can save yourself sometime and just open all the packs into a resealable container, and just use it as a spice. A lot of recipes can benefit from it, but not necessarily an entire packet.",Perfect for everything but soup,4
"I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause. I will be looking for a recipe for real avena which is probably not that hard to make and a lot healthier.<br /><br />As a sidenote, you can buy this at your local supermarket (in the section of south american foods) in 8 oz containers for half the price.",Good but not quite like the real thing,4

"After reading other reviews on this mayo, I had to give it a try.  I grew up on Hellman's mayo, and as another review observed, you will probably prefer what you are used to.  Kewpie mayonnaise has its own distinct flavor, I can't exactly put my finger on what gives it its taste.  I want to try making some deviled eggs with it, I think it would give a nice twist on the flavor.  I also tried Duke's mayo, which is a lot like Hellman's, only with a more pronounced vinegar flavor.  I'm glad I tried both of these, I expect I will use up the Dukes, not sure about the Kewpie mayo.  It recommends using within one month after opening.  But ultimately, I think I'll end up staying with what I am used to, which is Hellman's.",Had to try it...,4

One thing I like is that it is not too sweet.  A lot of these bottled coffee drinks taste too much like chocolate milk.

However, this is a small note that the product also may have traces of milk in it.  There are 50 calories (6.8 fluid oz.); so it isn't overly sweet or tart.  It doesn't have an overly strong coffee flavor, but I think it tastes best either very, very cold, or hot.  I drank one that was cold (about 45 degrees F), and it wasn't all that good.  However, in a pinch, it does give you a decent caffeine jolt (155 mg. per can), and it is easy to open and consume.

"My daughter is Chinese, and each year we send hong bao (red envelopes) to school for her to pass out to her classmates.  In China, children receive hong bao on New Year (CNY) from their families, with money inside.  For several years we purchased chocolate coins, but due to a child in her class having a severe peanut allergy, we didn't want to use chocolate coins because we could not be sure they were produced in a peanut-free factory.  So we ordered four packages of these bubble gum coins.  The coins are wrapped in bright foil.  It is a bit hilarious that we were using coins stamped with Mexican words and symbols for CNY, but the kids didn't seem to notice or care.  The gum is predictably a bit hard.  All things considered, a fun item.",Great price for a fun item.,4
"Firstly, the taste was approved by the whole family. Of course its pretty creamy and unhealthy so of course it would taste good :) There were some differences in opinion about the broccoli though. Some thought it had too much broccoli taste while others actually thought it was lacking.<br />The only reason i can think for this is that, the broccoli bits grouped into certain areas more during preparation. Thats actually an issue with this, everything really clung together too much. The picture someone put for the product perfectly describes what i mean.<br />In terms of amount; its quite a small amount they have in 1 box(it says on box ~5 cups of serving). With this amount, its only good for 1 dinner among 3 adults at most.

"Progresso's chicken gumbo soup doesn't taste all that great when it comes out of the microwave (or off the stove, if that's your way), but it tastes pretty good. It has white meat chicken, kidney beans, okra, rice, celery, carrot, tomato, and red bell pepper in it, as you can see from the picture on the can. Check the picture I uploaded to see what the soup *actually* looks like in the bowl. The chicken was pretty firm and just right, in my bowl. The gumbo taste isn't bad. You won't feel like you're in Louisiana or Memphis while you're eating it (unless you're actually IN Louisiana or Memphis), but it has the distinctive gumbo taste and is really quite good compared to some of Progresso's other soups. My biggest complaint with this soup is that the green vegetables came out mushy, as they tend to with Progresso soups, I've found. The celery and okra were good, just very soft and mushy, which isn't really what I wanted. It did a pretty good job of filling me up, though, as they pack a whole lot into that can as always.

"Tiger Black is certainly a decent coffee with a bold flavor that will definitely perk up your day. I've just found that it's not to my personal taste; I don't like dark roasts as much as mediums, such as another flavor by Coffee People called Donut Shop. This is because the dark roast flavor overpowers the cream I use, while the Donut Shop is a good balance that I will gladly have every day.<br /><br />Don't let that discourage you: if you like dark roasts, this one may yet become one of your favorites.","Good, but not a personal preference",4

"While I did enjoy illy's issimo caffe coffee drink, I do have mixed feelings about it.  The good, from my perspective, is that it's less sweet than all of the other alternative canned/bottled coffee drinks I've had, so it tastes more like slightly sweetened, strong coffee rather than very sweet milk with a little coffee flavor mixed in.  That being said, the product is labeled that it's ""espresso style"" and I think that's probably an overstatement.  Yes, this product has a strong coffee flavor, but it tastes more like a very strong brewed coffee versus a well pulled espresso shot.<br /><br />Given that I generally drink my coffee unsweetened, whether hold or cold, I don't think I would purchase this product regularly.  If you do like strong, cold coffee that's slightly sweetened, this product might be more to your liking than mine.  I'm still rating it 4 (""I like it"") versus 3 (""It's okay"") stars because I think the product is better than okay and is certainly good for what it is.  If a half star were possible, my personal rating would certainly be 3.5 stars.",stronger flavor and less sweet than many other canned/bottled coffees,4

"The sweet & hot has an excellent balance of spice, if you want something moderately hot but not extreme.  The jerky is ok, not great; it has a higher proportion of fatty pieces than most brands I've tried.  But it's an excellent value with good flavor, so I can't complain too much.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.","Good, not great",4

"I got these because I'm on a low-carb, high-fat diet and was wanting something high-fiber that also packed a bunch of omega 3s. These fit the bill pretty perfectly! The flavors aren't all winners, but they're all really strongly flavored which is fantastic for a crispy snack. I like the flavors of these more than I like the flavors of potato chips, honestly.<br /><br />They don't strike me as slimy when you chew them, but your mileage may vary - I mean, yeah, the texture is a bit odd (imagine chewing a bunch of sesame seeds, similar kind of texture) and they do get stuck in your teeth, but hey - that's flax seeds for you. If you don't like (or tolerate) the texture of flaxseeds, there's nothing these crackers can really do for you.<br /><br />The flavors: My favorite is the Mexican flavor, hands-down. A close second is the hemp (rosemary! nom nom!) and the cinnamon maple (higher-carb, but only barely. Really cinnamony). I'm not really a fan of the onion garlic and italian... I love garlic, but it's just too much. The original flavor is icky, it just tastes like soy sauce and flax. Meh. I like soy sauce, but it's not really an ideal flavor for crackers! If you like Japanese rice crackers you might like that flavor.<br /><br />I think the cinnamon maple would probably be a fantastic flavor to spread nut butters on (chocolate almond butter, almond butter, peanut butter, whatever).","Good for low-carbing, nice strong flavors",4

"The switch black cherry is a very good product. I love a drink that has no artificial and/or high fructose corn syrup. It is a great refreshing carbonated beverage. Amazon is about the only place I can find this stuff. Luckily, with Prime it doesnt cost anything for shipping. However, the downside is the cans are rather small and the cost is rather high. I would make this one of my primary drinks if it was less expensive. Also, while this isn't ""good"" for you with the amount of sugar it has, at least it is natural fruit sugar and is not as bad for you. But keep in mind this isn't something you want to drink a 25 pack a week as it is still high in calories due to the high natural sugar content.<br /><br />Flavor wise I have tried the fruit punch and the black cherry so far. I would have to say black cherry is my favorite.","Very good soda alternative, just expensive.",4

He's a chewer, and within an hour had the rubber-rope gnawed in two. But someone posted a photo of the modification they made post-rope that saved the day: inserting a tennis ball into the bottle. AMAZING IDEA! Whom ever came up with that should write the company and suggest the modification. He can't get through the bottle, and the ball blocks the hole enough to where he really has to try to get the treat out. It is loud, but this is the first toy to survive my lab. If it's lab proof, I'm sure it can survive anything!","If the rope breaks, it can be salvaged!",4

"While shopping at Costco recently, I tried one of the free samples of Amy's Lentil soup. I was really surprised at how delicious it was so I bought a pack of it. When I got home, my very health-conscious daughter asked me if I checked to see if it had any BPA in the lining of the can. I said that I had not. Today I spoke with a Customer Relations person at Amy's Kitchen and asked her if Amy's soup cans had any BPA. She told me that they had a ""small amount,"" but that they were testing other cans and should have no BPA in them by next fall. What I've read is that no amount of BPA is good for you and even a small amount might cause all sorts of bad things in one's body (cancer, heart problems, etc., etc.). I'm not trying to point the finger at Amy's products in particular, just make people aware that even CERTIFIED ORGANIC foods can be packaged in unhealthy containers and consumers should be aware of this.","Soup Can Contains ""Small Amount"" of BPA",4

"I gave this product to my girlfriend to try since she has long, color treated hair.<br /><br />When I first got this, a lot of the product was all over the plastic bag that it came in. Be warned, they sent it in a padded envelope and the shampoo was everywhere.<br /><br />From there, to me it has an interesting fragrance, nothing horrible, but nothing that I just have to use either. The first time I used it, I had to use a bunch of shampoo because I just couldn't get it to lather. After that, it was back to the normal amount to suds up my hair.<br /><br />When I first used it, I noticed that my hair felt a little drier and stripped. This is something that I notice every time I use a different brand of shampoo which I thing is just the feeling of the built up old product getting washed off my hair. With repeated use, this feeling went away.<br /><br />I also used the corresponding conditioner. Within the first couple days, I noticed that my hair felt thicker and softer. The ends of my hair still have the remains of some bleaching and are drier than the rest of my hair. They felt smoother after a couple days of use.<br /><br />The only negative thing I find is that my hair gets greasy faster with the use of this shampoo. The only thing I can think of is the extra nutrients that are supposed to help the scalp is just adding too much to my all ready normal scalp.<br /><br />Over all, this is not that bad of a product. I like how my hair feels softer and seems to have more volume without drying out the ends further. Using the conditioner does help the ends too, more on that on the other review. But I do admit that I wouldn't get it again just because of how greasy my hair gets with it.<br /><br />I think if you are looking for a product that will help your dry hair, this is one to look into.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","It Does A Good Job, But ....",4

"This freeze dried ice cream is great! It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the ""astronaut"" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product.","Great product, poor packaging.",4

"These two-millimeter long treats don't have the pronounced smell of the tuna treats.

Since the first ingredient in these Duck treats is duck liver, the girls are becoming treat snobs and act as if they are actually dining on Foie gras.

Always the duck treats are the first to disappear. It's funny to watch Piper push aside the other treats so that she can pick out the pieces of Omega treats.

"As others have said, ""if you like your tea to taste like the smell of a campfire"", then this would be the tea for you.  I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it ""smokey tea"" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of ""softens"" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!",Smokey tea!,4

"The bar is pretty good. Taste more like cinnamon than apple pie IMHO!!<br />The texture, to my surprise was pretty mushy, thick and had bits of almond throughout.<br />Very chewy and you can taste the real fruit inside. (just think of a few different dried fruits pressed together)<br />This was my first time trying bars like this as part of a new diet. I like the minimal ingredients used.(no chems)<br />I ate the Trio brand bars along side this one for comparison.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of personal preference. I like the more nutty, crunchy textures of the Trio brand.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a good bar. Not high on cals pretty good on nutrients.<br />Looking for a good tasting vegan bar, this is a good one to try out.",Good Taste!! Good Price too!!,4

"The chicken and noodle is definitely one of the better meals in the Hormel line. It is a little bit salty but no where near the saltiness many of the red meat meals have. The noodles are nice and thick (a previous reviewer described them as hard but mine were exactly as they should be even with the extra thickness) and the chicken is fairly substantial. If this were less calories and way less sodium, I think I like it enough where I might actually have this once in a while for a really quick lunch. But unfortunately 1400mg of sodium is way more than what I'm looking for in a lunch. Even still though, this is a pretty tasty one for Hormel.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.",One of the better Hormel meals,4

"This flavor is a very good one, though it is a bit stronger than the pomegranate lemonade that I preferred (until they stopped making it).  The first time you try it, it will likely seem to be very strong, but the tart flavor is very good.  Be careful not to spill it though, it will stain...and can even stain your hands.  I make sure to drink a sip out of my 16.9 oz water bottle before I pour in the powder to make it less likely that I will make a mess.<br /><br />Amazon also has a very good price on this.

"I don't have a cold right now but since I often take ginger and honey for a sore throat, I thought this might be a nice alternative.<br /><br />It might be, in a pinch.<br /><br />The ginger is strong.  Strong in a good way if you have a sore throat but you may not be that accustomed to it.  When I make ginger tea I use perhaps 3-4 thin slices steeped in a cup of water for about 5-10 minutes with a tablespoon or two of honey.<br /><br />I used about ¾ cup hot water for a pouch instead of the cup.  The ginger is nice and strong, lingering in the mouth and back of the throad.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's a bit sweeter than I would prefer (even when brewed to the recommended level) and there's really no lemon taste- just an aroma.<br /><br />There's also a somewhat bitter aftertaste that I'm not so fond of.  This taste is not chemical, more like an herbal bitter note.  I'm more of a coffee person so you tea drinkers out there might actually prefer it.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time deciding between three stars and four.  It's good, not great.  Probably 3 for flavor (It's OK) , four for convenience (I like it)",Ginger good for sore throats...not much in the way of Lemon...,4

"I'm a little torn between 4 & 5 stars...Daisy (25-lb. terrier / minpin / border collie mix) absolutely LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy.  I actually had to stop her from chewing it when I first gave it to her.  If I had let her, she probably would have chewed for another hour (since she had gone a full hour without stopping for anything).  The only downside (and I don't know if her teeth are still setting, but I know she has all her adult teeth so it can't be that her baby teeth are still falling out) is that her gums were bleeding after.  I found traces of blood on the toy as well.  I'm sure it is natural for her gums to bleed a little as the toy is pretty sharp, but I am limiting her use of it regardless.

"As I recently became vegan, and have incorporated tofu into my diet, I wanted to get a protein powder that was without dairy and soy.  This one fit the bill, and has vitamins and minerals included that many vegans risk being deficient in (B12, Calcium, Iron).  I add it to my oatmeal, I think it makes the taste richer and I appreciate that there are no added sweeteners.  The reason I give the product 4 stars is that, although I should have inspected more closely and seen this before purchasing, it has 270mg sodium per serving.  I find this to be too high, I even find my oatmeal a bit too salty.  Thus, I plan to mix this with another soy-free powder to lower the sodium content.  Otherwise, I think this is a great product.",Good - with a caveat,4

"This kibble has been the staple diet of my 80 lb Great Dane Mix (named Kobe) for the past year. He came to me two years ago from a rescue group who transports black dogs from the southern U.S, where black dogs have a very high kill rate, to the nortern U.S. to be adopted. He was about 5 yrs old at the time I adopted him, sight unseen, from Arkansas.  Severe alleries were included among the miriad of issues that afflicted him. This manifested itself in runny eyes, full body skin yeast infection resulting in what the vet termed ""elephant skin"" on his abdomen, throat, elbows, and haunches.  Also bald spots over his neck, throat, thighs, and toes from constant scratching and biting at himself. In many places the ""elepant skin"" was perpetually split/cracked, infected, and bleeding.  After treating the bacterial and yeast infections with both topical and oral agents which did clear up the bacteria but left the yeast as a chronic secondary infection of the allergies, I searched for other remedies.  Along with seasonal, environmental, and other allergies to dust, fabrics, vegitation, etc. I also found a lot of good information about food allergies.<br />Taking this information into consideration I scouted around for an ""allergenic"" kibble that was made by a company that has never had a recall, does not do animal testing, provides appropriate nutrition, and is somewhat affordable. Wysong seemed to fit the bill. Anergen has been a key part of Kobe's allergy treatment program for the past year.  Along with ""therapeutic baths"", Ketokonazole lotions, hydrocortisone lotions, diligent laundering of doggie coats/bedding/linens (no wool), and oral antihistamines Kobe's skin is soft and smooth without splits/cracks/infection; his bald spots have shrunk to half the size; and his eyes only run occasionally.  He still does scratch and bite at himself intermittently. I notice this usually happens when I deviate from the Anergen diet, giving him rawhide chews, beef bones with marrow, or cookies (organic) with mixed ingredients.<br />I don't really know what else, short of steroids, can be done to help him. I have avoided steroids due to their own detrimental health effects. Anergen seems to be the food solution to his allergies, which is a good thing! I add water to the kibble and let it sit about 10 minutes to form a kind of ""gravy"".  He likes this better than the straight dry kibble and it also helps to keep him hydrated.<br />Note: My other dog, a 9yr old husky-shepard mix eats Wysong Maintenance and is strong and svelt; and the cats eat Wysong Uretic.",Allergenic Dog Food?,4

"I'm a bonafide halvah-lover, ... so I haven't met a halvah yet that I didn't appreciate to some degree.  The pros and cons (in my opinion) of this Koska brand ""Tahin Helvasi"", (as the product is labeled, and which translates in english as ""Tahini Halvah"")...<br />Pros; Good price compared to other brands, (about eight bucks a pound when I ordered a two-pack, with free shipping via Amazon).  Decent flavor, especially with the pistachios mixed in. It's also packed well in two resealable plastic rectangular containers.<br />Cons; A slightly unusual texture, with a lighter and more crumbly texture than most halvahs I've tried.  I think this may be a result of the ""emulsifier"" listed in the ingredients. The only other ""con"" is that it's not made with real vanilla.  Overall, I still like it and would recommend you give it a try.<br />Here are the listed ingredients; ""Sesame paste (57%), sugar, Pistachios (8%), Emulsifier (E471), Saponaria root extract, Acidity regulator (E330), Nature-identical vanillin aroma.""","Tastes Good, (but room for improvement).",4

"Guayaki organic yerba mate' was the first organic mate' I ever purchased. The flagship label in the Guayaki line is their traditional ""yellow"" organic label, which is ok but has about 25% stems, seeds, and whole leaves. I like this San Mateo Guayaki organic ""green"" label better. It is, at least to my taste, a fuller flavor than the standard Guayaki. As of 5/28/11, it is substantially cheaper than the standard Guayaki label. The San Mateo label also seems to show less yerba stems and seeds. The reason I deducted one star is the presence of (even still) too many stems and seeds as well as the uncompetitive price. Guayaki badly needs to filter their Yerba leaves in their existing products or offer a different label with pure, refined leaf. Other yerba mate' vendors offer this and it is a gaping hole in Guayaki's product line. Even though this product is more affordable than the rest of the Guayaki yerba mate' line, it is still very expensive compared to other organic and traditional yerba mate' labels from other companies. An adjustment to competitive pricing as well as attention to filtering the yerba leaves would give this product 5 stars.","Better than the standard ""Yellow"" Guayaki",4

"I have a German Shepard Dog, who is trained as a service dog.  While out in public, he receives lots of stimulation, and if I'm asked first, he receives a lot of attention too.<br /><br />As a service dog, he's with me 24 seven.  Everywhere, everyday, all the time. He's a high energy dog, loves playing fetch with balls, but doesn't much like my tv, computer, or napping time. I love him dearly but everyone needs a little away time.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of Busy Buddy toys for him.  The number of Squirrels at two different sizes, and cut the bottom fingers different lengths so some drop out treats easier, some harder.  He enjoys them, they bounce funny, but he can empty them pretty quickly.  Which leads to them being dropped on my lap repeatedly, and not always in the best place.<br /><br />I found the tug a Jug which I didn't expect to last a long time because of the hard plastic jug. I also figured he'd pull the rubber tug out by now time.  Much to my surprise, he's been playing with it for almost a year with none of the problems I'd expected, other than having it dropped on my foot or lap.<br /><br />I've been able to use his normal brand of Kirkland Chicken & Rice kibbles dog food, mixed in with some Beniful for a change of pace. By using his normal kibble, it keeps the cost down, and allows me to adjust his meal portion size accordingly.<br /><br />It's also about the only toy he doesn't bring out to the back yard to hide and then can't find it again.  Which sends me a clear message he is very focused on this toy.<br /><br />Even though he's a large size dog, I didn't buy him the large size, in part because I prefer the rubber tug, in part it keeps the amount of treats down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy (and toy line) for their design and not making it impossible to use normal kibble instead of expense treat products designed only for their toys.<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd made the outside of the bottle with a rubber coating, or rubber bumpers so it isn't so noisy on non carpeted flooring.",One of the few toys that gives me some down time.,4

"These snacks maybe most suitable for young children ages 5-12, but they're also perfect for a busy and hungry college student. Why? It's convenient, and it's tasty, perhaps slightly better than your typical vending machine/fast food because of the controlled serving portions (each pouch is about one ounce in weight).<br /><br />As of the time of writing, at $10/box, it's not cheap, but if you compare it against retail/school dining choices, it's kind of a bargain, because each pouch comes out to be about 25 cents per pouch. This is one-fourth of the cost of your average vending machine snack. To make it more worthwhile, for college students, Amazon throws in the free shipping with Amazon Prime, which means that it gets delivered straight to your door, which is a HUGE time saver, because you don't need to drive out to the store and buy snacks. Plus, PORTION CONTROL! (of course, this requires resisting the temptation for second serving of snacks, which admittedly is hard to do so)<br /><br />My least favorite snack in the assortment is the animal crackers. They're just really dry and tasteless, almost like a cardboard substance. But I think they're are only six of them in the box, so it's not too bad.<br /><br />My absolute favorite snack has to be the fudge cookies. They are AMAZINGLY good. The fudge/chocolate melts in your mouth and the cookie is kind of buttery and melts along with the fudge/chocolate. It's really good. My only problem with the cookie is that they market it as a shortbread cookie, which it really isn't ... it's just a fudge cookie. Everyone knows that the Scots/Brits are the best at making shortbread cookie. Nonetheless, digression aside, the fudge cookies are awesome in their own right.<br /><br />Anyways, try one! The assortment isn't perfect, but if you're short on time, you won't regret it.",Perfect for college students,4

"Needing a healthy snack to take to work with me one day, I picked these up. As most of the packaging was in Japanese, I just automatically assumed that these were wasabi peas because they looked just like wasabi peas usually look. I didn't really give the ingredients more than a slight glance, as I was in a hurry.<br /><br />If you were wondering, these are not wasabi peas. They are, however, still very tasty & crunchy. They are lightly salted, having only 100 mg of sodium in each serving. (There are 4 servings in the bag.)<br /><br />The bag doesn't look huge, but it packs quite a big amount for the size it is & it really was good. If you want a nice Japanese snack that isn't spicy, has low sodium & tastes nice, you'll like this stuff. If you're looking for something spicy, you might want to pass over this product.","Not exactly what I'd expected, but still tasty",4

"These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet ""Bacon"" jelly beans do indeed taste like a very sweet and smokey piece of bacon. This is not flavor that I'm going to snack on, but would make a great gift for the many ""bacon fanatics"" out there. My wife commented that with a little vinegar flavor added in, they would taste like PA Dutch Bacon Dressing.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous ""Jelly Belly"" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />CFH",True Bacon Flavor,4

"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.",Best every day price,4

"This is the first time that I have purchased Haribo Gummi bears and they are chewier and the taste is more subtle than other gummi bears with which I was familiar.  However, they quickly become addictive and that is why a 5 lb bag would spell disaster for me because I would be unable to stop eating them.  I like the fact that the gummi bears are chewier because it slows me down.  Initially I ate several gummi bears at one time and it was hard to distinguish the different flavors.  I currently find the taste to be more distinctive if I eat the same flavor at one time.<br /><br />I will buy Haibo gummy bears again because I like the consistency and taste which I think is more subtle than others that I have tried.",12 Pack Order Helps to Limit My Intake,4

"My children (almost 3 & 1-1/2) love squeezable fruit & veggie pouches.  This product is a great way to sneak in veggies for picky eaters and a great way to have variety and meet your daily values when out and about; I also find them to be a great snack. However, it is very difficult to find pouches with veggies at the local stores; mostly fruit pouches are sold, not many organic ones.  So I went to Amazon.  While I was happy to find Happy Tots by Happy baby (one of my favorite brands) the price was not that great.  I later found it for substantially less ($2 less) at a local organic market.  As to taste, while i've tried all other flavors and levels/stages, I will say that there is a particular taste to the Happy Tots because of the addition of a particular grain (Salba).

"The flavor is almost entirely ginger.  It is barely sweetened and not at all lemony.  I really liked it but I don't think the rest of my family would.  The others would have put a couple of spoons of sugar and a big squeeze of lemon in it. (they like ginger-flavored hot lemonade.)<br />The flavor is much the same as slicing a couple of quarter sized slices of ginger into a cup, adding hot water, and mashing it a bit.  Then add one of those tiny scoops of stevia, or a few drops of stevia extract.<br />This product is a nice alternative for when you don't room in your pocket for ginger root and a knife. Honestly I will probably buy some for sick days.  I lived in Cambodia and the grocery shelves were always stocked with at least 6 brands of ginger drink so I do have an appropriate background to judge.  This product is at least equal to the best of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not a very satisfactory trial. We were sent only one packet from the box, so there was no listing of ingredients or nutritional information.  So I can't say how many carbs and how much sugar is included.  Yes, honey is nice but honey is made of sugar, sugar, and sugar.  Many of us really need to know how much.<br /><br /> I also have to vent, and this is probably not the company that produced it, but an Amazon employee - the single packet, the size of a tea bag, was sent in a 12x18x6 inch cardboard box with six yards of bubble wrap.  Shame.",I am a ginger fanatic and I liked this.,4

"I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.",Made my dog's coat shine,4

"First, like others have mentioned, mine arrived in a plastic wrap in a package with its lid open and shampoo all over the interior of the plastic wrap. Not only was it a mess to open.. but 1/3 the bottle was already gone. Next came trying the product.. so far 1 weeks time and I will update again after a month goes by. When I first put some on my hair and begain to lather I stopped and made sure I used the right bottle.... its like a cream, and doesn't feel like a shampoo normally would feel. I thought I grabbed the wrong bottle! I'm mixed on how the product feels, though it did leave my hair nice, but my other shampoos still do better. I tend to use various products and never the same shampoo when I run out. Its almost as if my hair gets use to a product and it no longer works well, so I mix it up.<br /><br />I do like the smell to the product and don't find it overwhelming as others suggested. I did not find it dulled my hair (I do have highlights)My hair did feel clean, not oily or dirty looking as others have experienced. Think this is a try it out and see kind of product. Everyones hair is so different so each review is based on the persons kind of hair really. My hair is normally not oily, but is flat and below shoulder length with highlights. I saw no major changes compared to other products so for that reason its OK. I do not like the cap to the bottle and again how its packaged. Nothing like getting a product and loosing 1/3 of it and having a huge mess..... perhaps if you want to try it try it at a local store.",Decent Shampoo.. Bad Packaging and Bottle Leaks in Shipping,4

"Not too bad. It is similar to the stone ground or multigrain chips out there. The smaller size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight. I liked them more for snacking because of this. The smaller size is not as hot for dip or salsa holding. Not too salty, for sure. Had a fairly low sodium content for a chip even.<br /><br />Earthy with a touch of salt is perhaps the best way to describe it.<br /><br />The ingredients are what make this. Simple, nothing crazy or 8 syllables. It is not like eating cardboard or styrofoam, just good stuff. If you've ever made corn chips with rough meal from scratch, this has a similarity in texture and quality.<br /><br />Lastly it arrived nicely packaged from Amazon. I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something that is always a plus with products like this.","Average Chip, Good Ingredients.",4

I had to rinse it several times to get rid of the smell.  Also, be aware that the texture is definitely different than egg noodles and they have no taste.<br /><br />I boiled them in hot water, added some beef base, and the noodles were fine.  The noodles absorbed the taste of the beef base, but use whatever you want with them.",A Great Substitute!,4
"These are good in a pinch, especially since they don't need milk, which I always seem to be out of (no little ones at home). Although the other Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that do require milk has a better texture and fluff up better, with these you just need to watch the amount of water, or they'll end up too thin. They have a slight butter taste without that fake butter taste. Serve them up plain, with butter, with gravy, or any other way.<br />Now, I'm off to order more...",Not bad....VERY convenient.,4

"This matcha is awesome. I am a caramel addict, so sometimes I'll get something caramel flavored without really thinking about it, which was the case with this tea. But really, the flavors work really well together.<br /><br />The flavor almost reminds me of what I'd imagine green tea creme brulee would taste like. It's got the obvious green tea taste from the matcha itself, but then there's the sweet, creamy notes from the caramel. It's okay when it's hot and by itself, but I think it's vastly improved when it's made as an iced matcha latte. No sugar necessary there.<br /><br />Beyond drinking it, this seems like it would make an excellent flavor for cakes and ice cream. I am definitely going to give it a try in ice cream in the summer.",Matcha meets candy.,4

"I like a good nut, and these Emerald Cocoa Roast nuts are pretty good nuts.  As I am also a chocoholic, though, my opinion may be biased.  :-)<br /><br />Not that these are overly chocolate-flavored.  This is not a chocolate covered almond.  Instead, these are almonds coated in cocoa powder.  It's not even glazed--just dusted, stuck on with oil.  Because the cocoa powder isn't strongly sweetened, you get a good mix of nut flavor with a chocolate chaser.  They're subtle, and good for a little munching ... but not for prolonged snacking; I found that after five or six nuts, they sort of lost flavor in my mouth until I cleansed my palette with a drink.<br /><br />All in all, these nuts are a nice change of pace from typical salted fare, without bringing the heavy sweetness of a honey raost to the party.  I would definitely buy them again.",Good Almonds,4

"This doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste like tea, either. This tastes like Kool-Aid, the sugar free kind. The immediate smell when I first opened the package brought me back to sitting on the counter as a kid while my filled that huge green pitcher, right before we dumped that magical powder turning water into the sweet taste of my childhood.<br /><br />It may very well be sweetened with honey, but it still has a very slight saccharine taste. An odd thing about this drink mix is the variation in flavor depending on how much water you add to the mix. You have to go pretty light on the water if you want it to taste at all like tea, but that makes the saccharine taste a little too strong. Heavier on the water makes it taste like Kool-Aid. That's fine with me, because I like Kool-Aid. This may, however, be an expensive way to go about a glass.",Can't find the Tea,4

"I drink Starbucks with my own grinder on the weekends, but during the week, due to convenience, I use a Keurig.  I have tried the Starbucks pods, and they are ok, but not as good as some of the other coffees that I have had.<br /><br />This is a strong roast.  It came in 3 bags with 12 ""pods"" in each bag.  They do not use the plasic cups on the outside, but just use a little coffee filter attached to a plastic disc which still fits in the keurig pod hole.  The needle in the Keurig Machine is not touched by the SF Bay pods.  This eliminates those stray grounds from finding your cup of coffee, or potentially clogging up the your brewer.  The filter bag with the coffee in it is not firm before it is used, but the grounds swell during the brewing process and the bag has a much firmer, fuller look after it is brewed.<br /><br />The coffee itself is pretty decent.  I think for the price, I would much rather pay 13 for a pack of 36, than 13-18 for a pack of 24 any day.  After the bag is opened, I put the unused coffee pods into a zip lock bag and have not had an issue with freshness.  I actually tried a green mountain donut house from a previous order, and when compared with the SF Bay, I prefered the San Fran Bay French Roast.<br /><br />EDIT: 29 Mar 2012<br />I usually leave the pod in the brewer until I brew again.  Recently noticed that the SF Bay pods have been dripping a little coffee after being brewed.  Not enough to make a significant mess, but it has been getting on the bottom of my mug and I notice a ring on my desk occassionally if I have 2 cups in the morning.

I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY"">Newman's Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ"">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]",Another great dark K-cup coffee,4

"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right.

"Often, foods that are targeted toward being free of an undesirable ingredient end up being heavy with other ingredients to make up for it - anyone remember the ""fat-free"" craze that gave us sugar-heavy, calorie-laden foods?<br /><br />I was concerned that these would have a cloyingly sweet flavor to make up for the lack of wheat and dairy - I was pleasantly surprised to find just the opposite.  Actually, my first bite immediately took me back to the days in the 80's when my mom tried to find healthier ways to make cookies without sugar.  Sorry to say, Mom's experiments didn't work out well... but with only 8 grams of sugar per bar, these would make Mom proud.<br /><br />I found enough chocolate to tip the scales from ""unsweet"" into ""just right"".  The almonds, coconut, and oats give a great texture that took a while to chew up, making the eating experience more satisfying.<br /><br />These were really great warmed up!  I ate my first one straight from of finding the package in my mailbox (summer + Texas = baked mail), and it was like eating a fresh cookie straight from the oven.  I had to stop myself from eating another one right away!<br /><br />Just for fun, I tried another one chilled.  This was also pretty good - the softness of the bar plus the cold made it a nice treat on a hot day.<br /><br />At the current Amazon price, it works out to about $.76 per bar, which is a fair price for a snack with less sugar than your average granola bar, and better ingredients, too.",Tastier than expected!,4

"Well Black Cherries are not steak, so what do I mean by meat.  I mean that when I eat cherries, and grapes, and other largely hollow fruits, I find the taste is in the textured pulp, just under the skin, what I call the meat. Most black cherry drinks I've had in the past despite the fancy names, could not capture this aspect of the taste, but I definitely detected it here.<br /><br />I enjoyed every drop of this drink, and was surprised that it was carbonated, something I usually only find with non-alcoholic grape drinks during the holiday season.  The carbonation works well with the 100 percent fruit juice blend.  I guess it all comes down to price and shipping, if the price is not too bad, and Amazon carries this product, I would probably buy enough, or combine it to get the free shipping.  I could do with a supply of these in my fridge.","With a natural black cherry taste, it's all about tasting the meat.",4

"I tested two flavors of Switch soda, and I liked the Black Cherry flavor the best.  The first sip made my taste buds start dancing; it was full of flavor. Not the super-sweet, overcompensating with sugar to cover up the lack of real taste kind of flavor, either.<br /><br />Have you ever eaten a pile of chilled cherries on a hot summer afternoon? If so, you'll know that every so often, one of the small fruits ripens to a deeper flavor than the others.  You'll be snacking along, and then... BAM! that one special cherry makes you sit up and take notice.  Well, that is what the first taste of Switch is like.<br /><br />Maybe my taste buds went into overload, and shut down, because the flavor-palooza didn't last.  My last sip was good, and I enjoyed the drink, but it just didn't deliver that same ""punch"" with every tip of the wrist.<br /><br />This soda is what I'd call ""lightly carbonated"".  I find that a plus, as it's not burp-inducing. But, if you're looking for a fruit-fizzy, you might be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a nice Switch from the usual soft drink fare and it's full of healthy goodness. I don't think I would enjoy drinking this everyday, but for an occasional treat, it's lovely.","The first sip was divine.  After that, more mundane.",4

My whole family liked this product.  It has a smoky chipotle flavor that (when tasted alone) leaves a slight burn on the back of your throat.  We used it on tacos and the sauce gave them a very distinct taste that we all enjoyed (no burn :) ).  My husband is incredibly picky and said he liked it and would eat it again. The Kid thought it would even taste good on a salad.

"I liked this beverage.  I followed the instructions and didn't shake it.  It is tough to review a product like this since it depends on how you like your coffee.  If you only drink coffee black than this will be too sweet, if you only drink those Starbucks Frappacinno drinks in the little bottle (I do like those!) than this may be too strong.  I like my coffee (hot or cold) with a little milk and a little sugar...this drink was pretty good for me.  It was a little stronger flavor than what I typically drink but quite good.  Not too many calories, not too many crazy chemistry project ingredients, nice flavor...I was happy with my experience.

"Our Standard Schnauzer wants that peanut butter pretty bad.  She's not one for rawhides or treats that involve work.  The mini Schnauzer only seems to like meat treats.  Jack (our mini) would take the treat, chew the rawhide and crack it.  Pepper (the standard) would steal the peanut butter treat out and then Jack would go back to eating the rawhide.  These are about four inches long and about an inch or so around.  The outside is like a rawhide and the inside seems to be the peanut butter and something treat.

"For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.",Closest thing to 70s Girl Scout Fudge Patties I've found yet--Keebler Fudge Filled Cookies,4

Each packet contains a whopping 10 grams of protein! A lot of nutrition in a small, lightweight packet.

"This one seems to be flavored more to a cat's liking than the rest of the Florentine varieties.  They're expensive, so buy one of each to see what floats with your cat but here, one will eat this and the other one won't.  It is gobbled up quite quickly too, I might add, by one of them so there you go!  Anyway, the greens addition is great for cats, they seem to like it in their other varieties, and they're high on the nutrition scale. So, if you're looking for higher protein and better nutrition all around, be sure to give these a go.

"Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.","Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!",4

"I've been doing a bit of experimentation with making pho at home, with varying degrees of success.  While the broth preparation is by far the most important, you simply can't toss in any kind of rice noodle and hope it will turn out ok.  Admittedly, I was a little worried about these noodles when ordering; the branding on the outside seems to cater directly to westerners, so I had fears that it would be an ""Americanized"", and thus flawed take on rice noodles.  Luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />These are pretty good noodles; they are not that fragile, so you don't need to worry about them breaking apart during preparation or boiling.  Thai Kitchen is an American owned brand, manufactured in China, but it is apparent (and important) that they have a higher standard for quality as I've struggled to find a single broken noodle strand in the boxes I've opened.  Some of the cheaper quality 'mystery brand' chantaboon rice stick noodles I've used in the past have broken when looked at incorrectly.  These noodles are a little bit thicker @ 3mm wide, but a little on the short side @ around 12"" in length.  They take flavors very well and are appropriate for many types of dishes; perfect for stir fry, as the packaging indicates.<br /><br />The only reason I am knocking a star off of these is due to the aforementioned shorter length and because they are a bit starchy, requiring some rinsing (lest you intend to thicken/cloud your sauces and broths).<br /><br />If you have no real asian markets (international isle at Vons doesn't count) near you, these are the ones to get.  If you do have an asian market near you, try a few other brands as well as this one.  You may find that you prefer these.  If you're wondering why someone with a very American name as mine is speaking about these with any kind of authority, it's because I'm asian-american and grew up with no shortage of fantastic, authentic asian cooking at restaurants and at home.

"I've tried quite a few energy drinks, mints and pills and have favorites in each area.  5-Hour Energy isn't my personal favorite as far as energy drinks go, but it is quite exceptional.  When I tried 5-Hour Energy, the first thing that I noticed was that I noticed nothing at all.  I gradually became more alert and less tired, but not once did I experience the jitters, a fast heart rate or any of the other side effects some claim to have experienced here.  What I did feel was what I feel like after having had a restful night's sleep.  I wasn't going to run a marathon at full speed, but I wasn't going to zone out for the rest of the day either.  I remained awake and alert for roughly seven hours, so the five hour claim might just be an estimate.  Either way, when it was time for bed, I had no problem going to sleep and absolutely ZERO crash effects.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of this drink is the taste.  It's somewhat medicinal, but pretty much all energy drinks have a medicinal taste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you want something to ""take it up a notch"" while working out or doing hard physical labor, 5-Hour Energy might not be for you.  However, if you want a few steady, alert hours minus the jitters, 5-Hour Energy is the perfect choice.",A Nice Way To Level Off,4

He 48 lbs, gets his regular meals in it and finishes in about 15 minutes.  I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it!  Worked great for the second dog for a few weeks, he wasn't as good at it, so it took him a bit longer to empty it so we thought it might be perfect for him.  We were wrong, he chewed the rope in half one day.  :-(  Third dog is just kind of dumb and just smells it and looks at it.  The plastic is really rugged though, they're able to toss it around on stained concrete floors without breaking it!<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this company's toys.  One of my dogs chewed a Kong but hasn't been able to destroy Premier's Squirrel toy.  Dumb dog likes the Twist 'n' Treat, it doesn't take very much brain power...",Worth a try!,4

Surprisingly good<br /><br />This product is better then I would have ever thought.<br /><br />I was quite surprised at how good this was. It was salty but not too salty and very easy to make and actually quite a filling meal.<br /><br />I added to it some sauteed mushrooms and onions and chopped green squash. ( Zucini) .<br />I also added some pre-cooked lean ground beef. ( Optional. )<br />Then I added some firm tofu cubes. ( Also optional )<br />A bit of ground pepper and topped it with some paprika and a dab of sour creme.<br /><br />I am a big eater so this made two (2) meals for me. One for that night and left overs for the following week.<br />The first night it was very good and a week later it really improved with age. I plan to buy more of this product.<br /><br />It was quck and eay to make.<br /><br />Dean,Surprisingly Good,4

"My 11 month son likes these, and we purchased them for him. Note that as other reviewers have stated, they are very small (what do you want for 110 calories?) and, as such, intended for young children-- this would do nothing for my appetite, but they are perfect for the under-5 set as a snack. I always sample everything I give my son, and I thought these were pretty good. If your kids do not have a pre-existing sweet tooth, they will probably like these. I thought they would have the consistency of a Nutri-Grain bar, but they are a little more ""dry"" than that-- as a result, they create more ""crumbs"" than I had anticipated, but I'm more than willing to live with it, based on the fact that they are organic (do not want to feed my son Nutri-Grain bars-- too sweet, and not organic!). The PB is very thin and so there is little danger of choking.<br /><br />Aside from the crumbs, the only real drawback for me is that they are not fortified-- no iron, zinc, little to no vitamins, etc. I do not think it would cost the company much money to add these ingredients; I thought it was sort of standard practice to fortify children's cereal/grain products, so I'm not sure why the company decided not to.",Good option-- wish they were fortified,4

"I enjoyed this nutrition bar, it tastes like a rich chocolate oatmeal raisin cookie. I found it to be very flavorful and the taste of rich cocoa really stood out for me. I think this is a good choice for a breakfast bar for those on the go. Of course I love nutrition bars and one concern I have is that people not use to nutrition bars may find this one a little dry, I also wish the bar was more moist and chewy. But I still enjoyed the flavor and ate them all. The bar is 200 calories, low in sodium 230mg has 34gm of carbohydrates and an excellent 7 grams of fiber. The bar only has 4gm of protein and I like to see them with at least 15 grams of protein. So with that said if it meets your nutritional guidelines I would recommend it.",Pretty Yummy,4

"I love mac and cheese and this is a dish close to that. It has a few packs of ingredients, pasta, cheese, dried broccoli, seasoning. All you have to do is add chicken if you want. The pasta is orzo, I had thought it was a little larger which I think would have been better.<br /><br />Everything tastes good but the big problem is that it gets cold real fast. Its very creamy and has plenty of flavor and even when it did get cold, didn't dry out and get too thick. It was s quick one pot easy dinner and made enough for 3 decent portions. It does fill you up fast because in my experience, orzo pasta tends to absorb and absorb liquids and swell up way more than regular pasta.<br /><br />Al in all it was a good dinner and my only wish was the pasta was shells or elbows or something like it.",Easy to make but gets cold fast,4

Other listings had specified if the bags were stitched with a colored hem. This one did not so I thought maybe it was completely neutral. The item description on the actual packing slip that arrived is '3""x5"", drawstring with thin red hem'. I just wish I had seen that written out somewhere before seeing it on the actual packing slip.

"This is a small can of iced espresso with a bit of beat sugar in it.  Little more and little else.<br /><br />It offers ""a touch of sweetness"" and it's a very light touch to be sure.  It's not nearly sweet enough for my tastes and could almost pass for unsweetened.  Personally, I'd prefer that they either made it sweetened or unsweetened, and not something in the middle, which this is.<br /><br />The quality of espresso seems pretty good.  It's dark, full-bodied and flavorful.  I personally prefer some milk, cream or frothe in my drink, but that boils down to personal preference.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Probably not, but again it's a personal preference thing.

"I wanted to try blue popping corn, since I have purchased blue corn meal to make cornbread.  I had read somewhere that blue corn contained a lower glycemic index than yellow corn.  Anyway, this popcorn smells great and tastes wonderful.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it takes more of this popcorn (than yellow O. Redenbacher) to fill a bowl.  And because the little kernels are smaller -- and lighter -- it's a bit of a challenge to use the air popper.  I found that if I use a tea towel and carefully tilt the air popper as they are almost popped, then they gently fall into the bowl.  Otherwise, they tend to just pop and stay there (above the hot air) to burn, because they don't ""jump"" out and into the bowl like the yellow popcorn.  I've also tried to pop the ""traditional"" method, in a large heavy pot with a small amount of oil.  They taste great, but don't all pop. So be prepared for many ""old maids"".  However, a great thing, in addition to the taste, is that there are virtually no little hulls that stick in your teeth or gums as compared to the yellow.",Blue Popping Corn!,4

It isn't waxy and has a great feel in the mouth, very creamy.  While it has a good taste, the chocolate doesn't overwhelm your taste buds.  I was a little disappointed in the ""finish"" - there wasn't a long lasting flavor in the chocolate, and that, perhaps is the one drawback I had from eating the chocolate.",Chocolaty Goodness,4

"In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C"">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G"">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.

"The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.",Tasty Treat,4

"These pumps fit perfectly on my glass Torani bottles (bought from another site, not through Amazon).<br />I haven't tried cleaning them yet, but in my past experience (working at a coffee shop), they should come clean with a good soaking in warm soapy water (don't forget to pump them to clean the inside & use lots of clean water to make sure you get rid of any soap residue).<br />The only issue I have (& why I gave it a 4 star rating) is that when I first use them on a bottle the syrup tends to spray out a lot from the air in the pump. I'd be okay with that, but it seems to be a problem for longer than it should on some bottles. I'm not sure if the seal is bad on those lids or if those pumps have holes in them somewhere? It may even be an issue with the syrups themselves rather than the pumps (which is why my rating isn't any lower). It's not a big problem since I can just place the glass right up under the pump, but it's not quite as convenient as placing the glass down on the counter. It's still better than using a measuring cup, though, so overall I am happy with these pumps.",Works pretty well on Torani glass bottles,4

"What I like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total.  Many other mixes make 12 or more, and, if you have a small household, you're stuck with way too many muffins.<br /><br />These were better than expected - they are soft, flavorful, and baked perfectly.  Also, use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking.<br /><br />It isn't the healthiest food out there, but overall, I'd recommend this mix.",Simple muffins that anyone can easily make,4
I received a trial packet that made one pot of this coffee. I think it's a good product to try if you like coffee but have to limit your consumption because too much coffee can irritate your stomach.  The aroma is nice and the flavor is good.

"Sun Maid pitted plums (or, prunes) are the best brand of pitted and dried plums on your grocer's shelf--period. These dried pitted plums are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They contain sugar (12 grams per serving) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />In addition, a few of these helps fight constipation really well! Don't eat too many--you'll have stomach trouble--trust me!<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these pitted plums are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that they do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. In my personal opinion, I love to refrigerate these and eat them cold. They are remarkably sweet, too.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the container. Eat or use these before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These pitted plums are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Pitted Plums provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!",To Life !!!,4

"I'm a confirmed hot chocolate snob and yes, I admit I only really wanted a Keurig to make a really quick, banging cup of hot chocolate (and maybe not be on a first name basis with every employee at Dunkin Donuts).  In fact, I don't even drink coffee, so the quest for the perfect hot chocolate for the Keurig is not one I take lightly.<br /><br />Of the brands of hot chocolate I've tried that are made specifically for the Keurig, this one is the best.<br /><br />I tried a couple of brews before I reviewed this...  So here's the conclusion that I've come to:<br /><br />I have a Keurig Special Edition B60 brewer, and the first brew I did as was suggested by the maker (shake the K-Cup before brewing, brew on 8oz setting).  Of course my brewer doesn't have 8oz, so I brewed at 7.25oz, the ""middle button.""  The result was a watery cup of hot chocolate with a fair amount of chocolate flavor, but still a little too watered down for me.  The color was really good, rich, dark, and even had some of that nice foamy goodness on the top.  I was *very* happy to see when I looked at the empty K-Cup after brewing that there was almost no powder or residue left in the K-Cup, a problem that the other hot chocolate K-Cups really suffer from no matter how hard you shake them and there was almost no thick chocolate gunk at the bottom of the mug when finished.  Awesome.  So overall, when brewed as suggested, it was the best hot chocolate I've tried for the K-Cup when prepared as-is, but not the best cup of homemade hot chocolate possible.<br /><br />The next brew I did I shook the K-Cup and brewed on the small cup setting, the 5.25oz brew.  The result was a hot chocolate that was a little thicker, beautiful color, lots of that spectacular white foam on top, something that looked like a REAL hot chocolate.  The flavor was much more defined, a lot more chocolaty, and very smooth and tasty.  Though I did notice that slightly Splenda-like aftertaste which kind of surprised me since I'm largely desensitized to that taste (thank you Fruit2O) and honestly it was ever-so-slightly just too sweet.  But wow was it good.  Still not the best hot chocolate to make at home, but really good.<br /><br />Third brew I did I did again on the 5.25oz brew, put a splash of half-and-half in the cup, then brewed.  Holy cow in a hat...  That was awesome.  Finally a substitute for my Dunkin Donuts trips.  So, so, so good.  No aftertaste, right amount of sweetness and creamy texture.  Great, rich color that looks like a melted Hershey Bar.  Right up there with the best hot chocolate one can make at home for sure.  For sure a taste that competes with hot chocolate I've tried from Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />So rating this for me was hard...  When made, straight up as suggested, it's OK and even when it's made with less water it's pretty good.  Since I think the Keurig is designed for speedy ease-of-use, I think a lot of people are looking for and expecting that great cup of hot chocolate right out of the box.  In that way, it delivers an OK product, the best K-Cup hot chocolate available now, but not an overall great cup of hot chocolate.  But if you're willing to put two seconds worth of time into making it positively delicious, you will be very richly rewarded with fantastic hot chocolate.<br /><br />I fluctuated between rating 3 stars because, out of the box, it's only OK, and 4 stars because when adjusted it's amazing...  I ended up going 4 star with the assumption that there are a lot of people out there with a Keurig who do coffee or tea where they add creamer and/or sugar to adjust it to their taste, and I see doing this as much the same sort of thing.<br /><br />Hopefully Keurig will put out a hot chocolate soon that's amazing right out of the box.  If we could get them to talk to the Land O Lakes folks (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M5RNTS"">Cocoa Classics Hot Cocoa Drink Mix 7 Variety Pack</a>), there would never be a reason to leave the house for hot chocolate again...","As is it's pretty good, with some help it's amazing, but best available for Keurig",4

"This is a breakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a breakfast blend also means ""the strongest daggone brew we can make"" mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!","Not the best, but CERTAINLY, not the worst!",4

"Our family eats a fair amount of chicken, and most of it is either grilled or baked. When we bake it, we typically use a Shake 'N Bake mix with it or something similar. Prior to using this product I requested from amazon Vine, however, we had never used a Shake 'N Bake product with pork. In all honesty, I absolutely love pork, whether it be pork loin, bacon, baked ham, deli ham, pork sausage, shredded BBQ pork, pork ribs - whatever. It's my favorite meat, bar none. Why I never thought to try something like this before surprises even me. Maybe it's because pork doesn't need a lot of help to taste good. Unless I'm eating BBQ pork, I don't like to put a whole lot of ""stuff"" on the meat, because I like the natural flavor of it. Fortunately, this mix adds just a bit of zest without drowning out the natural flavor of the pork (in this case, it was pork chops I was fixing). I liked it well enough to try it again, and my kids thought it was good enough to eat again, too. Not fantastic, but a good thing to try once in a while.",As good as I've come to expect from other Shake 'N Bake products...,4

"My dogs love chewy treats and these seemed like a good possible option to combine a safe and healthy treat with the opportunity to chew.  On the positive side, there was no excess packaging, the treats arelow calorie, gluten free  and safe/healthy for your dog if given in the recommended amounts and even for dogs on strict diets.  There's a nice cinnamon smell that's appealing to humans.  Both my dogs appeared to enjoy this treat and were eager for a second once they ate the first, so in addition to the positive aspects for a cautious owner, it was also popular with the intended audience.<br /><br />However, I'd also caveat this with a few other issues.  First, the package says a medium dog could get 2 sticks per day.  There are six sticks in a bag and the cost is $6 - that's fairly pricey given that my dogs (admittedly expert, hardy chewers) ate their sticks in less than 5 minutes.  While the cinnamon scent is appealing to humans, one of my dogs didn't seem excited about it at first.  She did decide to eat it after a couple minutes (she initially put it down and backed away), but only because the other dog expressed interest.  Once she ate the first one, she seemed more than willing to take another, but there was an initial hesitation.  I'd expected something that might take longer to chew through.  I'm the first to admit my dogs are super-chewers, so if your dog doesn't have jaws of steel, you might get more out of this treat, but it took between 2 -4 minutes (depending on which of the dogs) to eat the strips.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't mind the price, it's not a bad treat.","Good treat, but pricey",4

Pete thanks, we all liked it and like my older bro I too made cracker and ham sandwiches of it!""<br />12 year old: ""it was good but a little too salty for me, so my brothers and dad ate most of it.""<br />Dad: ""It was good and I joined the boys only I added an Italian ham to it, the spicy Capicola and it was great.""<br /><br />There you have it, only one hitch, a suggestion to Kelloggs, RE: I read said that, more than 27% of people are sensitive to or allergic to MSG (monosodium glutamate), so any company or restaurant that uses it is automatically shutting off a sizable segment of their market.<br /><br />I agree, why cut out ANY of your market just to use a cheap substitute for spices'? I give it 3.5 stars which rounds out to four stars above, I took off 1.5 stars for the MSG added because it limits the marketability of the product and because we could not eat it.",Ouch!,4
"I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann",Exactly what I needed,4
"After the careful consideration of a team of players, the general consensus was that the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce works well for most types of hair. It is not particularly fragrant and that was cause for satisfaction from those that dislike strong smells emanating from a clean hair. The amount offered versus the pricing makes this product your average purchase. For someone who is plagued with thin hair this shampoo does, indeed, revitalize somewhat the hair and scalp, but the results are probably in prolonged use of the same product.<br />Overall, everyone appeared satisfied and still enjoys this shampoo on the daily routine of life. The container is solid and secure and no unwanted spills were reported when transportation was required. With these conclusions in mind this shampoo get a very decent 4 Stars rating from us.",Works well,4

"Flavor 5 STARS:  First time I used the oil I poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs. It ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor. I loved it.  I pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it.  I wanted to buy this originally because I watched the Dr. OZ tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti-inflammatory properties.  I gave some oil to my Aunt who has an auto-immune disease and she likes the oil as well. I would definitely buy this product again.<br /><br />Ding for metal alloy container: It is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by Amazon.com the containers probably got dented in Amazon's warehouse because it didn't seem like the packaging should have caused the dents.  The way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so I would say ""expect"" dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers.  Dents do not make the product taste worse so I do not worry about the taste.  I will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again.  However, the odds of leaking happening probably statistically is not ""often"" if you receive shipments regularly.",Savory and earthy flavor,4

"I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.","High quality, organic!, a little flat",4

"In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C"">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G"">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

"I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)","Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg",4

while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.

I threw some table sugar on it and that made a world of difference in the taste though I had to sacrifice some nutritional value in order to make it so.<br /><br />One thing I did like is that one serving keeps me full, which is actually something I find difficult in most foods. It holds me over for 4-5 hours while I'm usually hungry after eating most meals in a couple of hours.

"Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise.

"Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity ""candy corn""'aspect one often finds in bourbons. It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18. It's lovely. Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco. There's some leather and cream too. First sip opens bright with honeyed corn. Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect. Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke. It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best. The absence of ""corn likker"" fruitiness is most appreciated. This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.","Lithe and balanced, Woodford is a polished sophisticated bourbon.",4

"I honestly don't know if this was supposed to replace a meal like Slim Fast(tm). It says it will satisfy hunger longer, this is mildly true. How much longer is up to each individual person. I would like it to satisfy more but what do you do to a shake to allow it to taste great, satisfy you even more, and not totally blow the overall appeal?<br /><br />Having spent many months drinking shakes as meal replacements (under doctor's care), I can say that these completely blow the taste of the other shakes out of the water. There is a taste that I always equate to vitamins in them but that's the added protein. Try drinking a protein powder and you'll see what I mean. It has a very high amount of protein for such a small serving, this alone makes it worth drinking no matter your size. The carbs are a bit higher than I'd like to see but that does come with the territory of protein and milk.  I bought the vanilla myself and had one chocolate from someone in the office who offered me a shake. I like vanilla because I can toss this into a blender and mix some fruit for a truly satisfying smoothie. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />One thing to note is the price tag. At Wal-Mart (where I live) a 4 pack is $6.49, making that roughly $1.62 per bottle. Even with the ""amazon"" pricing of $43.68, each unit costs roughly $1.82. Sure, what's $.20¢ per for the convenience of ordering online? Nothing, it's just something to point out. The tax on the item in a B&M store is likely what makes ordering online only slightly worth it, again YMMV.",Very delicious but not a meal replacement,4

For water, additional sipper would have been helpful. Everytime I need to drink, I have to first remove the cup, open the flip, pour the water in cup then drink.

"This is a pretty decent bar to snack on.  It has a sort of brownie-like consistency and taste.  The primary ingredient in this bar is dates which seems to be a pretty common one in the natural/vegan realm of sweats.  In turn, it has a pretty distinctive taste.  It is pretty tasty with a cocoa (not a rich chocolate) and almond flavor.  Quite moist which is nice.  My only complaint is that each bar is pretty small at 1.7 oz.  While golfing, I often eat bars like Odwalla or Cliff that are 2+ oz.<br /><br />On a sort of side note, it would be nice if Amazon posted the Nutritional Facts and Ingredients for all the food products they sell.",Tasty Brownie-Like Bar,4

"""Soba"" is a noodle made from buckwheat flour, and is one of my favorite Japanese foods.  If I lived somewhere in east or west coast, I could find Japanese food restaurant where I can eat it.  However, it have been only the way to use dried noodle here.  Once I tried to make ""soba"" with a buckwheat flour found in a store, it was ground whole buckwheat including pellicle and inner skin. It's flavor was ""soba"" but contained too much fibers.  Then I had given up to make it until I get this.<br />This flour is from good part of buckwheat, and suitable to make ""soba"" noodle.  I'm enjoying making ""soba"" with this flour on each weekend.<br />This flour is not ""sa-ra-si-na"" (in Japanese) that is a flour using the most inner starch rich part, but ""ichiban ko"" (1st grade flour) or ""nami ko"" (general purpose flour).  ""Soba"" from this flour becomes ""Edo mae"" (Tokyo style).  If this has little bit more of inner skin (or pellicle), I can make ""Inaka soba"" (country style), I like more than ""Edo mae"".","It is good for ""soba"" noodle",4

"These work just fine after spooning ground coffee into a series of these cups (do it over a plate with ground coffee in a small bowl). Doing so, you get just the fine coffee you want and are not trapped by the standard selections.

"The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix","Very good nutritionally, but expensive and clumpy",4
"These arrived in the mail and although I am usually the one to open all packages my husband got to these first. How did I know that? Well, half the container was mysteriously empty and the UPS guy JUST delivered them. After one bite of these delicious nuts, I solved the mystery.

Right then and there I knew, I could only eat a few more or someone would have to call the show Intervention on me. I like almonds but these are exceptional with their slight, not overwhelming cocoa/chocolately taste. They taste  so good I just can't bring myself to buy anymore because one is just not enough. I HIGHLY recommend these in moderation otherwise, eat a whole container but then spend at least an entire week at the gym burning them off.

"I love the taste of chipotle, and have used the dried pepper most often in marinades, rubs, and chile. When I tried this sauce, it was different than I expected. Picture a creamy dressing like Ranch with the smoky taste of chipotle peppers and other seasonings.<br /><br />At first I couldn't figure out how to use it. The bottle depicts it being used on a taco, but I prefer fresh salsas for that purpose. But I've used it in several meals with great success: as a condiment for broiled meats; as a dressing on sandwiches; and to add an ""adult"" flavor to the chicken nuggets I was forced to eat when my kids wanted them for lunch! I think it would also make a good dipping sauce for fresh vegetables, chicken fingers, maybe fried zucchini...? It's the kind of sauce you'd want to use in small amounts on the side, rather than pouring it over a whole salad or even a whole taco.<br /><br />A worthwhile addition to your stock of condiments.","Not What I Expected, But Good",4

"Review of any product necessarily reflects opinion.  I am not you (whoever you may be, reading this review).  Therefore, you may love this coffee.  I did not.  I gave it four stars because I felt the need to recognize that there wasn't anything wrong with it; it was coffee.  It was drinkable; there was nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />I just didn't love the taste, that's all.<br /><br />I don't know if this taste is a reflection of its low-acid content.  Moreover, if I were to attempt to describe how I perceived the taste, my description could come off as vaguely insulting; worse yet, I should have enjoyed it.  It had a sort of harsh taste, in my opinion, of a type I enjoy in other beverages such as unsweetened tea, particularly lapsang souchong.  Don't know it?  My friends describe lapsang souchong, variously, as smelling and tasting like stinky feet, motor oil, and dirt.)<br /><br />I don't know what it was with this coffee.  Therefore, I warrant that my review may be virtually worthless.  I struggled to find a way to write it such that I could impart some information; the best that I can impart is:  Try it for yourself.  Look at other reviews.  See mine as only one opinion; but honestly -- I really didn't enjoy this coffee very much.<br /><br />So I wouldn't exactly recommend it -- but it deserves a fair shake.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.",Puroast Low Acid Coffee,4

"I have been purchasing Reese Skinless & Boneless sardines for several months. These sardines come neatly packed approximately 5 to a can. They have always tasted fresh with no fishy taste. As an added bonus they are low in sodium, only 45mg/can. Most canned sardines are high in sodium. The sardines are good eaten right from the can or in a sandwich with tomatoes or scallions. Sometimes I add a small amount of olive oil as the fish can be a tad dry. Excellent sardines. An additional note: For what it is worth the sardines processed in Portugal are far superior to those processed in Morocco. Those from Morocco have of late been over cooked and bits and pieces while the ones from Portugal are firm whole pieces.",Lo Sodium Sardines,4

"I won't spend a bunch of time repeating what others say - just reiterate - If you need constant energy boosts, you probably have some vitamin deficiency or a job that isn't providing enough enriching growth and fulfillment (too deep?) but if I have to slug through a few hours, this stuff works for me.<br /><br />It kind of just refreshes my perspective, not really boosts like i'm going to run a mile.

Does make my heart beat a little more noticeable - which to me just screams ""DO SOMETHING instead of sitting here watching TV or typing amazon reviews"".<br /><br />It has sucralose in it (as does Monster Low Carb) which i think stinks. i'd rather just have a few grams of sugar than artificial anything so i don't drink it too often (though the sucralose is probably minimal since it's not a big drink) - on a side note - check out Xylitol from birch (not corn) if you want a supposed awesome alternative to sugar and sweeteners.

"The Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice (Blackberry) was a very pleasant surprise for me.  I had a few preconceptions which turned out to be misconceptions.  However, if the drink had turned out the way I was expecting, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />The first surprise to me was the carbonation, or lack thereof.  When the writing on the can says sparkling, they're speaking the truth.  This is much less fizzy than, say, a can of Coke or Pepsi.  And for a fruit drink, that's a good thing.  The sparkling does not draw away from the taste of the liquid.<br /><br />The other nice surprise was the taste of the blackberry fruit.  It's a more subtle flavor that I had expected.  It's not overly sweet, yet it has a strong enough flavor.  It's crisp and refreshing.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to this beverage is not the drink itself, but the container it comes in.  The can is only 8.4 fluid ounces.  This makes it a better size for children (the lack of artificial junk is also a benefit for the little ones).  However, speaking as a person who is somewhat larger than the average child, I would not have complained if the cans had been the standard 12 fluid ounce size.<br /><br />This is a moderate, yet extremely nice beverage.  It's moderate in flavor, moderate in carbonation and moderate in size.  The fact that it's natural, has no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, etc. is a very welcome bonus.",Moderation in all things,4

"A kind friend bought a six pack of these for us to try out. My pre teen has Celiac and our kitchen is GF and we are always willing to try out different GF items. Our current bread standby is from Glutino and, while it is not perfect, my kids enjoy it - especially when used to make french toast!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4"">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />The first four packs I made I followed to the letter. I was a little disappointed that the instructions on the back for using the bread mix for oven baked bread, bagels, pizza dough, cinnamon bread and egg free bread all stated in large bold lettering that it required the use of a heavy duty stand mixer. I don't have one and so those options were out for me.  But still, using the recipe for breadmakers turned out decent (if fairly flat) loaves. I made the basic recipe and the sweet bread. The instructions state that you should make this on a Basic White bread setting instead of the Gluten free setting on your breadmaker and that is what I did.<br /><br />(Note that if you are buying this mix to bake in your oven, the package states that you need to use a stand mixer!)<br /><br />My child said that the bread was okay but that it had a wierd texture and taste to it. I think the texture was due to the grainy nature of the 3 rice flours in the mix. The flavor, I think, is the Millet flour which tends to have a bitter aftertaste. Millet does have good nutritional value but if the flavor turns off the child from eating it what is the point??<br /><br />Anyway, I still had two packs to go so I decided to tweak things a little. I made the sweet bread recipe again but this time I used butter instead of oil and baked it in my Zojirushi breadmaker on a programmed gluten free program and Voila! The bread rose beautifully! It had a light airy feel to it; a bit spongy - almost like a cake. The 1/4 cup sugar covered up the bitterness of the millet, home made butter (could use unsalted) instead of the melted oil made it rich - and it tastes almost exactly like Challah bread!<br /><br />So if you are just GF and not CF as well, this is a sure fire way to make some excellent sweet egg bread.  And if, like us, you miss your Shabbat Challah, this bread mix will be a wonderful addition to your kitchen!",Great bread if you tweak the recipe a little - then you get Challah!!,4

"Well, this is the kit I tried first, and the back row of plants & center front are doing the best.  Both basils shoot right out of their pods.  The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny.  The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding.  And this is at the beginning of week 2.  I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.<br /><br />The big question is, where is the Parsley?  People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano.  I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil.  I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil.  However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do.  Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.<br /><br />This is an easy, low maintenence kit.  You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.  It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets  They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box.  Possibly because of slightly variable light levels.  The light is on 17 hours and it only waters when the light is on for this setting.<br /><br />Parsley will be part of both the Italian & French herb kits that will be available in September.","Tasty herbs, but why these?",4

"I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional ""full pot"" method of ""1 per person and 1 per pot"" (and for me, often ""1 extra just for the fun of it"") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them.","Good, but mostly for Earl Grey fans",4

"Unlike some other faux milk sports drink, Mix1 is worth the calories.<br />Pros: *Easily digestible with a good mouth feel (not sour or slimy)<br />  *The nutritional value (vitamins and minerals) makes it worth the calorie expenditure<br />  *Unlike some rival products, tastes like vanilla, not overly sweet or fake.<br />  *Haven't tried it but would probably make a good smoothie w/fresh or frozen fruit<br />Cons: *Can be pricey and hard to find<br />  *Not a vegan product because it contains milk solids--can't recommend to vegan friends<br />  *Unlike the recyclable plastic bottles the fruit Mix1 flavors come in, the tetrapaks used for the chocolate and vanilla flavors are hard to drink without a straw.<br /><br />But overall, I recommend Vanilla Mix1, especially since recently my favorite Mix1 flavor, blueberry vanilla has disappeared from the shelves.","nutrition value, taste worth the calories",4

"I love iced tea, and usually enjoy it home-made and unsweetened. Unfortunately, there are some activities that keep me from dragging along a large jar of home-made tea, so I have to settle for the fake stuff.<br /><br />I've tried the Crystal Light versions, and have universally hated the aftertaste, although I like plenty of their other flavors. I had also tried a Lipton version of their ice tea and lemonade a few years back, and wasn't that impressed. This one looked intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I always mix these with 26 oz rather than the 16 oz they usually call for, and at this strength the tea flavor is rather diluted, however the sweetness and mango/pineapple tang are near perfect. Very refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this mix takes quite awhile to dissolve in water, and it will settle to the bottom if you don't cap the bottle and shake aggressively for half a minute or so before drinking.",Better than the Crystal Light Teas,4

"Having lost our German Shepard that we raised from a pup at age 12 to heart disease a couple of years ago we are always interested in products to help our new dog live a longer and healthy life.  When I saw this I was impressed with the healthy ingredients in this snack.  When it arrived I began to open the package and Bella, our black lab, was sitting ready and waiting for what morsel was coming her way.  She eagerly accepted the treat and carried over to her favorite spot to chow down.  We watched in anticipation as she inspected the treat.  Finally she decided it was worthy of her pallet and ate it in a few quick bites.  We were enthusiastic at her acceptance of the treat as she can be very finicky.  However, a few days later, after receiving a daily helping, we notice she was leaving the snacks unfinished.  Perhaps she quickly grew tired of them or maybe she just decided to be finicky, but whatever the reason I now have my doubts that this will become one of her favorite snacks.  But, iF you want your dog to live a long and health life it is certainly worth the price to see if your pet will like them.",Worth a Try,4

"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.","Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor",4

By this point, the tea has now become a decadent dessert instead of a hot tea.  Thanks to Amazon.com I received my tea in record time and the product was in perfect condition!

"I'm an iced tea lover, and I enjoy most varieties, including green tea.  I tend to prefer plain/lemon teas to other fruit types, however, but I still decided to give this product a try, as I liked the idea that the tea is sweetened only with honey (i.e., no artificial sweeteners).  According to the packaging, each 8 oz. serving has 5 calories and 10 m.g. of caffeine.<br /><br />I really love the convenience of the little individual packets!  They are easy to tear open, and you could toss one in your bag/purse or bring them to work (which is what I did).  The dry crystals dissolve nicely in water.  For my own tastes, the tea was a bit too fruity--although it didn't taste like fruit punch (which is what I don't like about some fruit-flavored teas), you can definitely taste both the berry and pomegranate flavors.  However, I could also discern a tea taste as well as a touch of honey.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good product, and I would definitely recommended it to those who enjoy fruit teas.",Convenient packaging and good flavor,4

"I started giving both my dogs Innova dog food about a month ago slowly mixing it in with thier old dog food.  My 2.5 year old border collie mix has had problems with food allergies since he was about a year old.  He would chew and lick his paws till they were raw and developed a rash on his stomach and in one of his 'armpits' that would not go away after trying a couple different kinds of food and numerous topical treatments.  After giving him Innova for just a month the rash on his stomach is nearly gone and he chews on his feet significantly less, and I suspect it will improve even more after he is no longer recieving any of the other kind of food.<br />It has also helped my 10 month old doberman mix with decreasing the amount of food I have to give him and the amount of poo as a result too.  He also seems to have less digestive upset and diarrhea.<br /><br />I did a lot of research to find the best dog food that I could get locally and that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg every time I buy a bag (although I only gave it four stars because the price is a little high, but not unmanageable).

For me, the price of the product is worth it to protect years of gardening. I can only hope the company will reduce the cost-wishful thinking.",pepper wins out,4

"I never knew about Matcha Green Tea, this weekend while I was at our local Whole Foods, a lady approached me asking if I would like to try some tea and to have a demonstration. She made me a cup with a special whisk which creates a beatiful froth. I have never been a fan of the tast of green tea (I like the Rishi loose leave tea with the Jasmine) due to the stinky smell and ususually have to have it in some blend.  However, this one had more of a wheat grass smell and taste to it.  I didn't buy it initially and went back today to buy it - I googled it and found it on amazon for $7.00 less and am ordering more along with the whisk.  I tried using a regular one but after watching her prepare it - it wasn't the same and it didn't have that same frothy taste.  I'm curious for the regular Matcha drinkers how many glasses they make a day or if just one.  She also said I could add it to my protein shakes as well in the morning if I didn't like the taste and it would give me the same health benefits.  Love it.",Yummy,4

"These are hard dog biscuit treats (like MilkBones) in a square shape about 1.5"" on each side and 1/4"" thick.  So for a small dog, they're pretty big. I tried to break it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn't about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as-is. This is the only reason I'm deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.<br /><br />We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats - especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It's like she can't remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she'll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.<br /><br />So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I'm going to give her the real treat - usually some kind of jerky - but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that's a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.<br /><br />In Amazon's 6 pack it breaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It's more expensive than treats I'd find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It's way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can't compare the two and this will not replace my dog's duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal.",My Picky Pup Ate Them!

"I was in a local grocery store that has a lot of items imported from England when I saw cans of Heinz Spotted Dick Pudding. Well, I'd heard of it. Hasn't everyone? The name sounds more like a medical condition than a type of foodstuff and it must lend itself to a certain middle-school-level humor, not necessarily limited to those of that particular age. In any case, I had about a half can (too much) after lunch. I heated it up in the microwave and, after heating, coated it with a veneer of Devon custard. The combination was quite good. It's much too high in calories (from fats and sugars), of course, so I'll have to watch my consumption. However, it was an interesting treat and now when I hear the snickers, I'll understand a bit better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Quite Good. Much Too High In Calories.,4

My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that it's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them.","Good pancakes, lots of work",4

"I am a rather casual consumer of energy drinks.  I have had my fair share of them to get me through the day as needed. My very favourite drink got pulled off of the market for no other reason than because of its controversial name.  ""No Fear Energy Drink"" has an eye catching can design and what's inside had a decent berry taste.  Many drinks are either sickeningly sweet or have funky aftertaste due to the taurine and other ingredients. No Fear was better than a good many better selling energy drinks.  As for its properties:  it really was rather mediocre as far as how much of an energy 'boost' that it gave.",What's to Fear?,4
"This is a purely smooth and silky soup, not a bean or veggie chunk to be found. I loved the consistency actually; it was like a light cream rather than a starchy thick soup. But, I can never leave well enough alone. I saut&eacute;ed three sweet carrots in 1 teaspoon of oil, then added the soup to heat, and served it up with some chopped avocado. The combination was delightful.<br /><br />The soup on its own had a wonderful taste and just the right amount of flavor in terms of heat (not too much!), spices, and salt. Nothing was over the top, and it all melded rather nicely. There was just one note that kept tasting ""off"" to me. It was mostly in the aftertaste, so it didn't deter me from devouring the bowl. Nonetheless, it left me curious, so I checked the ingredients and finally spotted the culprit ... cilantro paste. Yes, I am one of those cilantro supertasters who generally dislike it. Cilantro fans will find this soup spot on, but luckily, the cilantro is far enough down the ingredient list that even most ""cilantro tastes like soap"" people (such as me) will enjoy it.<br /><br />I will purchase this soup again either for a quick lunch, or as a recipe starter ... it has great potential! Plus, I love that it is both dairy-free and soy-free.",Nice Creamy Soup with Good Flavor,4

"I purchased several assorted jars of Mrs. Renfro's Salsa products and will review them as we go through the jars.  The first one we've opened is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LG2AW0"">Mrs. Renfro's Habanero Salsa Hot -- 16 oz</a> and it's better than average but not knock your socks off jarred salsa.  Initially, the sauce was very thin in consistency, but after refrigeration, it thickened a bit.  Nevertheless, this is definitely not home-made fresh type salsa, it is a jarred and prepared in large batch salsa product.  At the cost of a couple dollars at the store, we were not dissatisfied, but I wouldn't pay more for this.  There are a few mushy tomato chunks in the product, so it's not totally smooth.  The heat is intense but lasts only briefly, so if you're looking for lingering heat, I'd recommend another salsa.  For a quick jolt of habanero, this is very good and worthy of a four star review.  I'll compare it to the other Mrs. Renfro salsa products as they are tasted.",Saucy and hot for a moment or two,4

Bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me.  Sweet foods and drinks didn't taste any sweeter.  I was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again.

"Taste of the Wild has had so many benefits for my dogs, that I have found it very difficult to know that I must switch foods.<br /><br />With an 18% fat content, you'll find that it is one of the highest fat-content foods on the market.  Both of my dogs have put on WAY too much weight... and one of my dogs (both border collies) is an EXTREMELY ACTIVE & fit ""frisbee dog"".  My other BC, however, has battled lyme disease - and so has achy joints and fatigue. It makes exercise difficult, and the weight has piled on.<br /><br />My dogs LOVE the taste of Taste of the Wild (Buffalo)- so much so that they have been PICKING it out of the weight control food that I mix with Taste of the wild (I'm in the process of switching to a lower fat content food)!<br /><br />Having fed Taste of the Wild for the past 2 1/2 years, I can say that their coats are BEAUTIFUL.. shiny and healthy...their stools are firm and ""consistent"" (easy to pick up)..they love the taste.. and the price for such a high quality food is very affordable (I buy it from Tractor Supply). 1 of my dogs is wheat-intolerant, so this has been very easy on his system!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this food is a little bit TOO good, and now I must put both dogs on a diet!<br /><br />I'm hoping Taste of the Wild will create a version of this product that is more around 10-12% fat content so that we can once again feed our dogs this WONDERFUL food.<br /><br />*Note, I do not over-feed. My dog who battles the effects of lyme disease (which was treated somewhat successfully), received less than the recommended amount for a dog that is 65 lbs.  My other dog, 40 lbs, ate the recommended amount.<br /><br />**UPDATE** :  AFTER writing my initial review, I opted to keep one of my dogs on this food for awhile as I researched what food would be best for him.  Then, as his activity level went up - he went from having gained a few lbs, to losing weight very rapidly, and was ""scary"" thin.  Our vet evaluated the food, and as it turns out, grainless food is not for him and his activity level (not enough fuel to burn).  Our dogs LOVED this food, and I believe it is a very high quality, affordable, healthy food for dogs.  It just didn't work out for mine, unfortunately.","Fabulous food!

"A 6-10% solution in H20 will clean your toilet and tub/shower just as well as commercial products and for pennies on the dollar. Citric Acid is actually the main ingredient in many tub and shower cleaners. It chelates mineral stains well, and is actually easiest to use sparingly from a spay bottle right after you shower. I just spray a little around, and after I dry off I rinse it with the shower head. It takes about 30 seconds total every other shower, but you never, never need to clean your tub or shower again if you do this. Be careful not to inhale it as it is still mildly irritating. Commercial products add some surfactants to help reduce mist and help it stick to surfaces, but with every-other-day-use I find that the h20 solution keeps the tub and shower perfectly clean and the chrome shiny without any real work.

I used this good tasting Agave in pitchers of ice tea that we drink all year long.<br />It blends in qickly and tastes real good too.

"Bought this popcorn along with the Elite Popcorn maker.  Great taste, I like the fact that it has three separate pouches so you can vary the seasoning (I like mine salty so I use it all).  Can't be any easier to use, no measuring, popcorn & oil stay fresh because they are sealed.<br /><br />Came back to add my review and got some great tips.  Such as actually heating the oil first instead of dumping it all in at once.  Also liked the tips of adding the oil before turning on the popper (always worried about melting plastic or burning my hand) and pouring the popcorn/seasoning into a scoop to add to the popper.  Thanks to those who took the time to post the tips!",Popcorn lover,5

"Unlike microwave popcorn, you cannot hear the pork skins cooking, so only by trial and error and the wattage of your microwave will you know how long to cook these. Cooked to the proper timing, they will be fluffy, melt in you mouth. 15 seconds too long you will have a stinky unedible product.<br />It is something that you must try. I cooked mine for 1 minute 45 seconds and they were not all done. I do not know the wattage of my microwave.<br />So try them for your self. As I said, they are different than popcorn, but have the same results if left too long in the micowave, stinky.",Totally wonderful if not overcooked,5

"I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.","A great product, you must try!",5

"There was always something intriguing about this brand of snack bars, and the unusual name is part of the mystique. Since I have tastes that are off the well-worn track, I finally took the plunge and tried out the dark chocolate fig bars. And I was delightfully surprised. They remind me of the old ""Apple Bakes"" bars that we used to get at one of those ""Big Lots"" kind of stores, which feature clearance products. So you might not get bowled over by this one's fairly humble presentation, since it seems to have minimal hype. But I really appreciate their simple list of ingredients, and here you get 90% fig in each bar! It's a very dense snack - not unlike a brownie. The box they come in is also a nice touch -- very practical and perfect for hiding!! It looks like they are also made in Wisconsin, so I am glad I am keeping my purchase money fairly local. Plus I have a close relative who lives up there! All in all, this bar (and the other tasty nutrition-savvy ones by the brand) is ""the road less traveled"" but definitely packed with satisfaction. I plan to savor this box for a while and use the rest for gifts. Looks like 2012 is going to end in an awesomely Oskri Christmas!!",AMAZING UNEXPECTED FLAVOR COMBO W/ OFFBEAT BRAND NAME,5
"This was my 1st attempt to get off artificial sweeteners. I liked it! It takes as much as sweet n'low for each cup of coffee/tea(3 packs)..I should say it takes a little getting used to, it is less sweet that sweet n low(since natural sweet is less sweet anyhow) but you get used to it quite fast! and there's no aftertaste or anything like it.  If you looking for something natural & with zero calories then you should give it a taste. I didn't like ""stevia in the raw""",good stuff,5

"Starting off- I hate the taste of coconut water. I like coconuts, coconut milk and things that are flavored with coconut, but the water is aweful! I have been only drinking the chocoloate coconut water (which is mixed w/a little coconut cream), but at 110 calories and sugars added I decided that I need to expand my horizons. I did hesitate b/c I read many of the reviews and some people received bad batches (if I were this person, I would have definately contacted the company)- however my batch was good! And while this doesn't taste like the chocolate coconut water (which tastes like slightly watery chocolate milk), this is pretty decent and I will continue my subscription.",Good batch,5

The thickness of the vinegar is not because it's been reduced, but because it has been aged for so long and for so well.

Great for topping caprese, prosciutto, serrano ham...the possibilities are endless...",Incredible Balsamic!,5
"This is a very good drink.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Sparkling Clementine.  It is funny when I tasted the drink I thought, yup, that tastes like a Clementine.  Then I looked at the back for the ingredients.  There are juices (from concentrate) from White Grape, Apple, Lemon and Orange Juice.  No Clementine.  Funny enough it really is a nice flavor.<br /><br />Izze also offers this beverage in a just over 8 oz. a can.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />This is not a hydration beverage as much as a tasty treat.  It is not unhealthy so you don't need to feel guilty by downing one or two of these in a day.  Not calorie free but not too bad either.  The taste is not overly sweet.  I have heard from others who consider it bitter.  I disagree.  I think this bitter taste is from tastebuds too used to sugary sodas.<br /><br />A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book",Great Tasting!,5
"makes excellent yogurt. after several tries, my directions are one bag per liter of milk (best to use whole milk), and let it be 18-24h to get solid yogurt. the yogurt is a bit more acid than I would like, but I think that can be still optimized.<br /><br />remember to use highest quality of milk.

"I am doing Atkins, and I really missed noodles.  For me it wasn't necessary to have PASTA per se, but anything close, and these ramen-like noodles seemed like a good thing to try.  Having also tried low-carb pasta, I can say these are a HUGE improvement.  So far, I have only used them in stir fry, in which they are perfectly tasteless until they absorb the flavors in which you cook them.  I was frightened at first that I would be able to taste the strongly fishy smell of the liquid in which they are packaged.  But by following the instructions--rinse them for like 15 seconds and plunk them in some boiling water for a minute--I was able to completely de-fishify them!<br /><br />My main concern now is the cost, since these cost about 10x what a similarly sized pack of ramen noodles costs.  I am hoping to be able to get them in larger quantities, hopefully more densely packed in the package since it seems like 3/4 of the package weight just goes down the drain.  If I can get these for less than a dollar per 7 oz serving by buying in enormous quantities, I'll eat them twice a day for the rest of my life.  Seems like they could sell these in larger packages or jars and get a higher noodle-to-water ratio?  I bet the biggest cost of this item is shipping since they're basically shipping a pound of water.","I was a skeptic, but I am glad I took the plunge!  They're great!",5

"This protein has an excellent amino acid complex. I prefer Milk and Egg over why proteins as they are absorb into your body more efficiently. Whey protein is absorbed quickly, and if you are only working out once or twice a day, then a lot of the protein isn't going to get absorbed effectively. Milk and Egg based proteins take longer, so you get a constant flow of protein rather than having your body trying to absorb it a couple times a day. I take about 2 scoops of this protein, 2-4 times a day, and, working out every other day, I've been putting on about 5lbs every other week.",Excellent Protein,5

The rest of my family prefers plain white rice, but I dig my carbs complex like wicker furniture; thus the birdseed-like package impression appealed to me.<br /><br />I was unprepared for how good this rice is. It needs no salt or other flavoring. Just a pat of butter or a splash of olive oil, and the lovely nutty chewy blend of this rice shines through. I may end up gifting out the rest of the packages in this order; it's too good not to share. Expect another order from me very soon.",WOW. So flavorful and great texture!,5

I love all types of chocolate but especially dark chocolate. I would consider this to be one of the best dark chocolate bars that I have tried so far. It is very smooth and rich without a bitter aftertaste. These bars are 2.25 oz. and each has 330 calories. For the size of the bar I would consider that 330 well spent calories. The size is just enough to satisfy you without being too large and excessive.<br /><br />These chocolate bars are 100% organic. I don't buy a lot of organic products but it is nice to know that this product is 100% natural.  Each bar contains 54% cocoa which is dark but not the darkest that I have tried. My personal opinion is the darker the chocolate the better it tastes for the most part. These are definitely worth trying.,"Smooth and rich dark chocolate, tastes great, worth trying",5

"This is the third flavor I tried of Lipton's Tea & Honey instant flavored drink mixes and was still not disappointed. I used a full packet with a 16oz bottle of cold water. It dissolved quite well with some vigorous shaking. This tasted very good and as advertised. The water had become a refreshing and tasty Mango & Pineapple Green Iced Tea sweeten with honey.  The packets are very convenient too carry with you and too use anywhere you can get a glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />I wanted this for flavor and did not care about calories but for those who do one warning. The box list that these are 5 calories per serving, which is eight ounces. But each packet is designed too be used with 16 ounces so is 10 calories. So for two servings (which is what I drink) you are consuming a drink with 20 mg of caffeine, 0g Fat, 0g Sodium, 0g Protein, and 2g each of Sugar and Carbohydrates. Plus this flavor claims too supply 10% of your daily Vitamin A per serving.",Great Tasting Ice Tea with Vitaman A,5

I love how they are tiny sized too so it's fun for him to pick them up and eat.  Not to mention how healthy they are!",Not only fun for my son to eat but healthy too!,5

"I love this product and have been using it for many years now. It makes a perfect yogurt every time. I use the Yogourmet incubator too - a gift from my mother when I got married 12 years ago. The gift that keeps on giving is always the best! I have tried all of the Yogourmet freeze dried starters with fantastic success. The Yogourmet Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt Starter, is my favorite, found here on Amazon for a GREAT price. I give this company a 100% positive review. I have never had problems with any of their culture products or with the Yogourmet incubator machine.<br /><br />I use 2 quarts of milk with the recommended 10 grams of Yogourmet starter. I have found for myself, that the key to making great yogurt is to heat the milk to 185 degrees and continue cooking it at this temperature for 10 minutes. Cooking at this temperature kills any harmful bacteria in the milk that remains even after pasteurization. It also breaks down the proteins in the milk insuring a great yogurt SET. Apparently, the proteins are easier for your body to digest in this broken down state as well. Cool the 2 quarts of milk to 112 degrees, add starter, (10 grams freeze dried starter or 1/2 cup leftover yogurt from original batch) 1 1/2 cups optional powdered milk, up to 1 cup optional sugar and up to 1 tablespoon optional flavoring extracts. Incubate until desired tartness is reached. My kids prefer the maximum sugar so the yogurt tastes more like store bought. Although with this much sugar, the milk takes longer to turn into yogurt - up to 24 hours. Try using honey extract, vanilla extract, raspberry extract, etc.",Best Freeze Dried Yogurt Starter,5
"Thank goodness these are available--they're the perfect snacks for low-carbers! Recently discovered they're also good for bariatric surgery patients--a post-surgical friend who travels for work picked up a package of mine, read the nutritional info, and said it would fit into her plan.  It's difficult to find high-protein snacks that are easily portable for a briefcase or carry-on bag in case of getting stuck on a delayed flight with nothing available that she could eat (which has happened more than she would like!)",Love these!,5

Organicville is simply amazingly delicious ketchup. It is sweetened with agave which is much sweeter than sugar but better for you because of its low-glycemic index.

"Ebony and Ivory, side by side in this bag, two great tastes that taste great together. Why can't we all get along as well??? Sweet caramel corn and deep, dark chocolate battling for the most attention from your taste buds, but it ends in a delicious tie.<br /><br />If you're expecting ""kettle corn"", it's not really like that, it's more like caramel corn but there are not big globs of sugar/caramel like I've had with other brands (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Just enough chocolate, not too much.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the bags are too big for one serving. There's no way you can put it down once you've started, and you end up being a pig. I suggest pouring out a reasonable size serving into a bowl, and then lock up the bag -- make sure you give the key to someone else!",Ebony and Ivory,5

"At first, I thought it was a bit bland. But, I started using a bit more and cooking it down just a bit more which helped a lot and brought out a very nice balance of spicy, soy and sweet flavors. I've also been throwing in a few dried Japon chile peppers for a little extra heat. It's about a dollar less per bottle than the Chinese sauces at my local grocer and it's the best I've tasted yet. I'll definitely be buying more...",Good stuff!!!,5

"I figured that a dog food made with beef and Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor would smell really good to a dog, but I did a little test.  I put one dog's regular food in a paper bowl and the new food in another paper bowl--so that the bowls wouldn't interfere with the test.  Then I put the old food on the floor in its regular place, and I put the new food further away.  The dog smelled her regular food first, and then she started sniffing all over in the air until she tracked down the new food.  She gobbled that up and then ate her regular food.  The next time I put the new food further away--behind the dog food storge container--and she tracked it down and ate it first again before eating her regular food.  (I divided the food half and half so it would be her regular amount.)<br /><br />""Real Beef is our #1 ingredient"" it says on the bag.  In the list of ingredients that is followed by soybean meal, soy flour and lots of additives, including the dyes and corn products, etc., plus 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Green beans and potatoes are listed as garnishes.  There are crunchy kibbles and tender pieces, which I'm assuming is the beef.  It's for adult dogs, and the product is now made by the Nestle Purina Pet Care Company.  A company in Switzerland owns the trademarks.  (I trusted Purina.)<br /><br />The instructions say to gradually mix the old regular food with the new, which I always do--except for the two tests.  Btw, while studying the information on the bag and making notes at the dining room table, the dogs were all over me.  One wanted to climb up on the table via my lap; fortunately he's short.  (He picked the beef pieces out of his regular food earlier; it was mixed together.)",The dogs give it five stars!,5

"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you.",Vegan Organic Kosher Choice,5

I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.<br /><br />I like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like Franks Red Hot, this doesn't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.<br />I have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.<br /><br />The mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot(the hot being the heat that I particularly enjoy).

"These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the ""snack-size"" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes.

"Our mini Dachshund loves these. Limited to 1 a day. One of the few ""treats"" that he has not tired of. Also, his breath has been noticeably fresher since he has been having these. So far, best price on Amazon. The local pet food chains' sale prices has not yet come close to the regular price of these 96 count 'Teenie' packs.

"I'm impressed with how easy these bars are to eat, very good flavor and energy.  I like them better than Lara Bars but they do have more sweetener in these to be fair.  I'd give the protein peanut a 5/5 star because the nutrition is really good, the cashew cookie is about a 5/5 in flavor but the nutrition profile is suspect since it has low protein....I won't take off stars but it is a concern I want to let others know about.",Excellent Energy/Protein Bar Products,5

This stuff is really addictive.  I usually don't have time to eat during work.  I like to take granola to pour into a cup and gulp down as I work.  I can't stop eating it.  The granola by itself is great.  Add the dark chocolate (just the right amount of sweetness) and strawberries and it's awesome.,Addictive,5

"Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these ""doggie crack"", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes!",Love this product,5

"I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!",Great for potty training!!,5

"I was first given a box of this Yellow Label from a co-worker who had traveled to China.  I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor.  I found it in a Food Max in Stockton, Ca but then the store closed down.  I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also.  I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it, so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from.  The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all.  This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store.  I am buying enough to share with my friends.....",The smoothest tea.......,5

"I don't use sugar in my home due to the lack of carbs in them...what I don't like about this product (which does not change the rating) is that older bottles used to put the fiber content on the Nutritional Label where it showed 1g of fiber per 16 grams of carbs which is why it's better than sugar for diabetics.<br /><br />But it's still a sweetener so be careful...<br /><br />Interesting article...[...]<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars because it does what it's supposed to do, sweeten your food, although it's nutritive value isn't comparable to grade A 100% organic maple or black strap molasses.",This is the Best,5

"This is the best dog food!  I have seven dogs, three over the age of 14 and they are as spry and energetic as dogs half their age.  We went grain-free years ago after one of our dogs got cancer.  I began reading about excess carbohydrates and how BAD they are for our dogs (and us)...Initially we used EVO because it was great and it was the only grain-free availble.  We were very happy with it until the price went through the roof!  We tried several different grain-free food over the next year or so.  Some the dogs just didn't like.  Some aggravated my Lhasa Apso's allergies.  A couple of my dogs are susceptible to yeast infections and the EVO had curtailed that problem but it came back with other foods.  Finally we tried Earthborn's Grain-Free line and VOILA!  They love it! The price is right, no allergies or infections...everyone is healthy and happy!This is the best food around and the price is right.",Healthier Dogs because of Earthborn!,5

"The fact that this tea is 'detoxifying' really intrigued me and so I picked it up at my local grocery store. :) So far I've been drinking it for a few days and I'm liking the way it makes me feel, although for any real health benefits I'm sure I'll have to drink it for longer.<br /><br />When I first opened the box to use it I have to say I was disappointed. For me the smell is kind of off-putting and I was sure I wasn't going to like the taste. But I'd already bought it so I decided to brew a cup anyway just to see how it turned out.<br /><br />I love adding fresh lemon slices or small 'cutie' mandarin oranges to my tea for sweetner (because I don't use sugar), and so for this tea I added the juice of one mandarine orange (along with the actual little orange pieces, love having them and seeing them in my tea!) And it turns out as much as I hate the smell (still do...) I love the taste! With the fresh mandarine oranges it really gives it a taste reminiscent of apple cider (weird, but true, and really good). Also, I absolutely hate black licorice, but I really like this tea, so I'm thinking it won't be a problem for others who dislike licorice as well...<br /><br />It's a very strong tea with bold flavors and is a really good replacement for coffee, at least for me. :) Don't be afraid to try it. :)",Hate the smell but love the taste :),5

"I just received this coffee in the mail approximately 15 minutes ago.  Since we have been out of coffee for a whole day, I promptly pulled out my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS"">Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> and made a cup.  When I saw the nice froth after pressing the coffee, I knew it was going to be good.  I didn't expect it to be the best cup of coffee I have had since my trip to Phil'z of San Francisco which, in my opinion, is the best coffee in the world.  At this point in time, I am willing to rank this Kona Blend as number two on my all time list of great coffee.  The coffee is smooth, mellow and lacking a bitter aftertaste (the AeroPress probably helps with that).  The beans appeared fresh and were very aromatic.  I will certainly be maintaining my 'subscribe and save' status.<br /><br />After reading the previous reviews, there are two ways in which I can conceive this coffee tasting like Folger's:<br />1) The coffee was old when the reviewer received it.  I've been ordering Boyer's coffee for a while and I've never had this happen, but I am sure it is possible.<br />2) The reviewer used a drip coffee pot.  If you are picky about coffee, do your taste buds AND the beans a favor and get a better coffee maker.<br /><br />Anyway, that is my opinion.  As a student on a graduate stipend, ~$17 for a 40oz bag of great coffee is definitely worth it.",Delicious.,5
"I use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat.  If you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  Another idea: combine Sweet Chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken.  Like I said - it is good by itself, but serves as a great base for other things (from salad dressing to marinade).  Buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything!",Perfect Condiment,5

"I am not a tea person, I dont drink coffee either.  I do drink juice and soda, etc.  The reason I have never really liked tea is that most dont have enough flavor for me.

"I'm picky about iced tea and haven't been a huge fan of Lipton in the past, nor am I very fond of powered drink mixes in general. I thought I'd give these a try since I'm on the go lately and don't have time to make proper iced tea. They are EXCELLENT. Just sweet enough, but very fruity, almost like the tea with flavored syrup you get in restaurants. I'm addicted to these now and can't go back to the hum-drum Crystal Lite flavors. The Blackberry Pomegranate is the best, but I've also tried the Mango Pineapple and it's really good too.<br /><br />I should mention that the crystals are a little harder to break up in cold water than most single drink mixes.

"I received these Pure Naturals Bars free, as part of Amazon.com Vine program, to generate reviews for new products. I have been looking for a bar that is completely natural, no fructose, no chemicals and no fake chemical sugar sweeteners. These fit all of what I was looking for, the taste is good, the bars are a good size 1.7 ounces, and they are all natural. for vegetarians and Vegans; theses Bars are Vegan. These are definitely going to be my choice for a good carb protean Bar. They are 7 grams of protean, and have 5 grams of fiber. I Highly recommend Them.",Just what I was looking for.,5

"This blend is perfect for any time of the day,  morning or noon or night. My preference is the House blend, because it doesn't leave that lingering sour 'finish' I experience with each sip of the Columbian blend. The House blend finishes clean and inviting , something I don't experience with other blends. And if I feel a need for a little more robust flavor, I'll just pick the smaller serving size, for my taste at that moment.<br />I've sampled a number of blends and brands from various Keurig providers, from Green Mountain to Gloria-Jean's and more, but for me personally, the Van Houtte House Blend is my choice.",Perfect Anytime,5

"I always liked to consider myself a tea drinker, but I really wasn't until I found these tea bags.  Delicious!  I was skeptical at first since Lipton, while a well-known name, doesn't really make artisan teas all that well.  I was so wrong.  The tea is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, with each sip lending itself naturally into the next.  Because it's a white tea, there are very low tannins.  And the tea bags themselves are fun.  These are not your mother's teabags.  Way cool mesh with a pyramid design allows for better steepage (plus it just looks awesome).  I definitely recommend this to anyone, tea lover or not!

As they continued to raise the price of coffee up and up and up I was trying different ways to utilize my Keurig coffee maker, purchased refill cups etc you know how that works. Well this is by far the best way to enjoy a good cup of coffee, the way the cups are packaged does not bother me at all, I don't let it sit around to get stale , I drink it. If you notice the bags are vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag would not work people. If it is not broken don,t fix it, and this is not broken so just keep these prices affordable, and keep the quality of the coffee just the way it is.","This is a no brainer, Great coffee",5

"I am pretty particular about what I give my dog for treats. She has always had a funny tummy. If she gets something not right with her she vomits and gets some digestive issues going. My sister has long been a fan of these treats so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />After giving my dog one treat a day for a couple of days they seemed to agree with her stomach and she moved up to a couple a day. She responded well to them so they get the thumbs up there. She is also fairly motivated do things for them as well.<br /><br />They don't have any odd odor and there isn't any residue left in my pocket from carrying them around for awhile when she is out and about with me.<br /><br />Overall, they are a high quality treat with a decent treat value (in dog terms). I'm not sure how often I will purchase them, but from what I have experienced with them right now I would certainly consider it.",Elkhound approved,5

"This mango pickle is an excellent burst of flavor for your flavourful dishes.  A little goes a long way.  It's also great to eat as is if you like pickles.  I have used this for years in stews and curries and never thought to eat it until I was convinced to try it and now it probably gets eaten as much as a tasty, tangy snack as it does in cooking.  It is superior to any other mango relish or pickle I've ever had.  Like all the other Patak's products it adds great taste to a meal.<br /><br />One of my favorites is as a primary seasoning for ground beef with or without caramelized onions, green onions, garlic and whatever vegetables you have on hand (usually green or red sweet peppers and tomatoes).  Anything from a half teaspoon to a pound of meat (minimum amount) increasing to taste.  Experiment.  Don't overcook lean ground beef.  Use Adobo or Badia complete seasoning to taste.  note: Badia does have MSG.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Badia-Complete-Seasoning-Sazon-Completa/dp/B001O4GMDU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1344360665&sr=8-2&keywords=badia<br /><br />my favorite Adobo is by La Flor.  Goya makes several varieties available on Amazon... I remember being underwhelmed by Goya Adobo. It's not bad, La Flor's versions are just better (and cheaper).  Try your local international or Latin Grocery. See it at La Flor's own site.<br /><br />Hint: start defrosted, seasoned ground beef in a skillet with low heat and no oil is necessary.  If you use oil, olive oil is tastiest.  Caramelize onions, green onions and Garlic separately first in olive oil.  You may also precook the vegetables if you like them well cooked or if you like your meat lightly cooked.  Add vegetables and onion mix to seared meat.  Cook to preferred 'done-ness'.",Awesome to cook with or to eat,5

I started subscribing to this syrup this summer as a replacement for my usual Nature's Promise syrup.  I'll admit it took me a little while to get used to because the taste and consistency are very different form the Nature's Promise (NP).<br /><br />Consistency<br />Coombs is thicker than NP which allows me to pour a thin and controlled stream onto my waffles. I don't like to drown my waffles. I do tend to lose a small amount of syrup onto the edge of the container but I think that must happen with all syrups.<br /><br />Flavor<br />I think the flavor is a little stronger than Nature's Promise. Maybe more than a little stronger.  I'll admit at first I liked Nature's Promise better but I just had to get used to the stronger flavor of Coombs.  Now that I have I can't go back.  And I even tried just out of curiosity.  NP is tasteless when compared to Coombs.  Coombs is a perfect compliment to my whole grain waffles.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and sweetness which allows me to also taste the waffles.<br /><br />Bottle<br />I like the bottle.  The extra unopened bottle sits on a small wooden kitchen cart with some other things and it looks good. Seems to fit in.  Of course you have to refrigerate the opened bottle.  It's easy to use. It has a small handle that I think can fit most people's index finger comfortably. Then you grab the skinny neck with your thumb and middle finger.  It really seems to be very ergonomic.  Very easy to pour.<br /><br />Value<br />When subscribing it's like getting a free bottle of Nature's Promise for every two 32 oz bottles I get.  And because I can easily control the pour I can make one bottle last about two months and that is using it almost every day.<br /><br />Great product.  I highly recommend.,Thick and just the right amount of sweetness and maple,5

"I've always ordered chipotle sauce on my sandwiches when I eat out but never could duplicate those sandwiches at home. I tried a chipotle mayo that's on the market, but it wasn't the same. And then I received a sample of this. This is exactly what I was looking for. It's got the same kick as the sauce at a major sandwich chain that I love. I tried this on more than just my sub sandwiches though. It's yummy on quesedillas, fajitas, and tacos. Plus, it's good for dipping veggies and fries.

"I was surprised watching out two Huskies eating Chef Michael's creation and then asking for more because they would not normally eat bagged, dry dog food unless hungry. This may be a first because, as it's probably the case with most dogs, they would rather eat human food then dog food and if human food wasn't available they'd first go for some fresh 'rabbit' or 'field mouse' if they could catch any.<br /><br />I haven't tasted the food myself but our dogs seem to find it delicious. As for its nutritious qualities, the number one listed ingredient is 'beef' so it appears to be so. There is some text on the bag claiming that there are vitamins and minerals that would give the dog a shiny coat but that's probably speculation. I don't know of anything that I could eat and make my hair turn shiny so I can't see how such a miracle food ingredient could exist for dogs. If you want your dogs to have a shiny coat, there's shampoo.<br /><br />The food appears to smell good too and it comes in a variety of bits, some soft, some crunchy. The bits come in different colors but that's probably something that we humans are more likely to notice or appreciate because dogs' vision is believed to be either black and white or something close to an old 50's color TV.<br /><br />Since this is the first 'from the bag' food other than Milk Bone that our dogs actually love, it gets a well-deserved five star rating.",Our dogs love it,5

"These are very good, high quality Garbanzo Beans. I purchased these Garbanzo Beans for making raw hummus with, and I was not disappointed. They are very large and very good. They don't have that ""off"" taste that some garbanzo beans have. They make the best raw hummus I have ever made. They arrived plastic bag, inside a nice burlap sack. The beans were very clean and I have yet to come across a bad bean.<br /><br />High quality bean, excellent taste. You can't beat the price, and 5 lbs. goes a very long way!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.",Very Good,5

"Crispy, chewy and intensely flavorful -- WOW, they are just great. I've loved ginger snaps since... forever. So, I've tasted lots of brands both good and bad. Some of them have no ginger taste at all -- We like to call them ""flour snaps!""<br /><br />Mi-Del Old-Fashion, Swedish Style Ginger Snaps have great taste, healthful ingredients, and I highly recommend dunking in some hot coffee or tea for even more of that comfort food feel!<br /><br />If you don't like them...

"*****<br /><br />Oh, I love this pasta! It is thick, chewy, absolutely extraordinary! And made with authentic flavorings to boot! The red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder. The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder. The black pastas are flavored with squid ink, the off-white are au naturale. The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.<br /><br />The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!<br /><br />To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />*****",Superb Pasta!,5

"I never used white flour much prior to becoming gluten free but there are some recipes that simply don't turn out as well with any other type of flour. One of those is dutch babies which turns out light and fluffy made with this flour blend:<br />4 EGGS, 1 cup MILK, 1 cup MAMA'S FLOUR BLEND with 1/2 tsp XANTHAN GUM (always add xanthan when using a GF flour). Add ingredients one by one (in order) to a blender until blended well then pour slowly into the middle of a 10-12 inch iron skillet pre-heated in 425 oven until 1/4-1/2 cube BUTTER is (just) melted in it then swirled to cover sides.

I really like them!  I cannot wait to get one every morning.  I jump and whine and wag and do everything I can to let him know how great they are.

"This is a great tasting hemp protein powder.  I decided to stop using muscle milk because of the artificial sweetener and the issues surrounding absorption of whey protein.  I found that muscle milk, which tasted great, was giving me indigestion and well.......let's just say gut issues.  This Nutiva hemp shake is very smooth and has a great flavor, not chalky or gritty at all in my opinion.  I have no issues digesting the shake and I'm thrilled to be getting protein that is easily digestible.  A simple shake recipe is included on the tub which tastes great, but I've been using this powder as the base for my morning kale shake.  I find that the Nutiva really masks the grassy kale taste; My morning shake has been transformed from something I had to force down to something I look forward to and enjoy every morning!<br /><br />Here is my kale protein shake recipe-<br /><br />1 serving of Nutiva Hemp Shake powder (3 tablespoons)<br />1 cup coconut water<br />2-3 large organic kale leaves (red kale or normal kale) torn into small pieces, I break off and discard the last 1"" of stem<br />Approximately 8 spinach leaves with stems<br />1 whole banana, peeled<br />1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter<br />1 piece of raw ginger, the size of 3-4 stacked quarters<br />1/2 apple<br />small handful of ice<br />-add more coconut water or ice if it's too thick<br /><br />Hint- start by blending the kale and spinach with the coconut water to create a smooth veggie consistency before adding the other ingredients",A great hemp protein powder!!!

"I first found these about two years ago at Sam's Club, and being that I had two dogs that loved pigs ears I was interested.  My elder dog (now passed away) was getting up in the years and having a hard time with the regular pig ears and had lost all interest.  I got these, and she loved them.  She had a few teeth pulled but still could tear these up.  My younger, bigger dog loves them too.<br /><br />And I'll tell you this too.  My hubby forgets to close the bag properly (or simply doesn't notice, you be the judge!), and these things do stay soft for a few days (nay a week or so) even if you don't get it closed quite right.<br /><br />They don't last too long in this house, but if you want a good treat for your doggies give these a go.

"I'm always trying different ""energy bar"" type products. Lately I've been eating the Larabar during my long XC skiing tours. I've got to say that I think these are one of the best tasting bars I've eaten... ever. I love the tangy taste of the cherry and it is also good news to me that it is made with raw ingredients, no added sugar and no saturated fat (cholesterol free).<br /><br />The closest thing I could equate this bar to would be the inside of a fig newton cookie. It's firmer though and has more pronounced cherry flavor. I find it satisfying and I do ""feel good"" about eating it. I also like Cliff Bars but if I had only these two to choose from, I'd choose the Larabar Cherry Pie. Yum.",Excellent taste and great for pick-me-up during activities,5

"I bought 3 packages of these peppers. Though there were some brown ones most of them were in good shape and ready to grind up into a fine seasoning. While it wasn't as hot as I expected it to be it was as hot as they were described. Hotter than I can eat on their own (at least for now). One good thing about the ghost pepper is, it doesn't just have an intense heat but has a really intense kind of smokey flavor that really makes it a yummy pepper if you can handle it. It goes good in chilli if you're used to spicy foods. I wouldn't use more than a quarter pepper a serving though.",A bit better than I expected.,5

"I tend to prefer darker chocolate -- 65-70%.  So I was expecting this 54% bar to be sweeter or creamier, thus not entirely to my liking.<br /><br />I found this bar neither waxy nor chalky, as some of the darkest chocolates can be. Neither is it quite creamy. Rather, it melts very slowly in my mouth, leaving none of the bitterness of some dark chocolates and none of the filminess, either. I guess you'd call it a clean finish!<br /><br />Neither my palate nor my reporting skills are entirely sophisticated when it comes to chocolate. I can't pinpoint the flavor as being like that of any tropical or tree fruit. And, like most people, I have my preferences and so my opinion is highly subjective.<br /><br />What I can say is that I like this bar very much and will be interested in the other bars in this Newman's line.  I also like patronizing this brand, as they do so much good work through its non-profit efforts.  I also like the fact that it is organic and that, as best I can determine, this is slave-free chocolate.  That is worth paying a few cents extra for, in my opinion.","My new favorite dark chocolate bar, organic and ""slave-free""",5

"When first taking a bite of Mallomars, there does not appear anything unusual about this pure chocolate-coated cookie.  But once knowing about its 90 year history with the Nabisco Company, it is a cookie filled with not only a marshmallow and bottom cookie wafer and outer chocolate covering that was indeed a precursor to the now all too familiar s'mores concoction.  And most importantly, this is a cookie that has filled the memories of many with much indulgence and nostalgia.<br /><br />After opening the box in which the cookies came in, I noticed one major difference with this package of Mallomars, it no longer contains the nice yellow wrapping that needed to be torn to get to box's opening and rather replaced by a simple plain yellow box with the regular cover design with the trademark name, picture of the cookie, and nutritional facts on the back.  Despite that difference, it is the cookie that matters and its semi-dark sweet outer layer and fluffy marshmallow filling that may satisfy one's sweet tooth.  And it is highly recommended for anyone seeking an alternative to the chocolate chip cookie or ginger snaps.",Yummy classic cookie,5

"Stash 'double bergamot' Earl Grey tea absolutely is the best Earl Grey I've found, and I've tasted quite a few of them both here in the US, and while traveling in Europe.  The regular Earl Grey in this brand is also excellent, but the 'double bergamot' variety has a little more flavor than the Stash's regular Earl Grey.  I highly recommend both, and if you are curious like I was, treat yourself to one or both of these, and you will probably never want to purchase any other brand.<br /><br />I'm not sure the reason, but the other brands I've tried just do not taste as good.  Whatever Stash is doing with this tea recipe, it works.",The Best Earl Grey Tea I've found,5

"This tea has a smooth, well rounded flavor and goes very well with steamed milk. I drink tea all day, and Earl Grey is my go to black tea. Earl Grey is great black, and a bit of extra dark chocolate on the side is better. Nothing breaks a hot day, or tension like a good tea. This tea has an aroma that pulls. Of the many brands out there this is definitely in my top 5(like #4 or maybe 3), because of the consistency in flavor, good selection, and the company mantra doesn't hurt either. I generally let this tea steep much longer than other brands, because it just doesn't get bitter. My wife got me hook on Earl Grey lattes, and everyone I've offered it to. If you're looking to try something new or a different brand, Numi is well worth a try. And if you've never had the latte it's: a splash of hot water, tea, vanilla syrup (I like just a shot for 16 to 20 oz, but the amount's up to you), and fill with hot milk.",Worth trying,5

"When I get cold, I always get severe sore throat (normally lose my voice and bad coughing afterward). Same pattern everytime. I tried many cough drops, spray, etc. to erase the pain but those work for really short period of time only. This time, I tried this tea immediately when I felt my throat getting sore. Oh my goodness, it really worked! My throat felt much better just after one cup, and didn't get that severe pain like I normally do. I'm truly  amazed. I'm not a big fan of the taste of this tea (I thought it's similar to Aveda tea), but it was well worth drinking.",Amazing!!,5

I have been a slim fast drinker for years. One taste of this shake and I'm hooked! I like to put it in the freezer for about 30 min. before drinking it so it is nice and COLD. I love chocolate so the milk chocolate flavor is my pick. It is a much smoother chocolate than the slim fast milk chocolate. I just wish it came in 6 or bonus 8 pack like the slim fast. So far I've only seen it in 4 pack. Because of this it is a bit more costly than slim fast. But again the taste is much better. I highly recommend it!!,Absolutely delicious!,5

It would be helpful if Amazon clearly stated that the packaging has been changed by Bob's Red Mill so that one will not be ordering Bob's Red Mill Aluminum Free Baking Soda when this is no longer an item.

"My wife and I recently took a trip from San Diego to Great Basin National Park in east-central Nevada. It's about a 750-mile drive and we attempted to do it in a day. On the way there, I was getting real drowsy by the time we got to Las Vegas and we still had another 5 hours of driving. We'd stopped at a truck stop for gas and I noticed the little bottles of ""5-hour Energy"" drink. I'd seen them advertised on TV but had never tried any kind of energy drinks. Being somewhat cautious, I sipped about half or the small bottle, saving the rest for later. Well, it seemed to work fine.<br /><br />On the way back to San Diego, I was tired and drowsy right from the beginning. I was fighting sleep all the way from the park to Las Vegas, where we gassed up. Remembering the ""5-hour energy"" drink, I bought another little bottle for the seven-hour drive to San Diego. After driving for about an hour, I consumed the whole bottle. I was wide awake almost immediately. It was amazing! I still felt very tired, but I was awake and alert and remained  that way for all the remaining drive to San Diego.<br /><br />Other than the awakeness and alertness, I experienced no side effects at all. My wife hated the taste and said she would not drink it again, but then she wasn't the one who was driving. The taste seemed fine for me. Somewhat medicinal, perhaps, but no problem.<br /><br />This stuff is effective! I'll now always have a couple bottles in my car for any long drive. It's expensive, but well worth it. The cost by the case, by the way, is substantially less than the cost of single bottles in the truck stops.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Effective!,5
These dried fruit snacks are great for camping and hiking.  The seal is waterproof and the fruit is always crunchy.  I eat them with lunch almost everyday!  The price is a great value.<br /><br />3 Years later:<br />I get these through subscribe and save and it makes them about $1 a pack (compared to over $2 in the store).  My 10 month old loves them too.  She eats the strawberries and blueberries and I eat the apples and cherries.

I bought some online, not from an Amazon dealer, and the quality was not as good. So I can highly recommend this product when purchased from Whole Foods and Mrs. Greens. I love the peppermint and the spearmint flavors and the cinnamon is nice too. I really like that it doesn't have aspartame/nutrisweet (and all it's other names like phenylketuronics) as that gives me headaches. I also like that I can buy it in bottles of 100 or 300.

"I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals.

I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these.

"A few years ago, my wife was on a new medication that would make her sick all the time.  We were on vacation and she was in our room throwing up all day.  I walked over to the Whole Foods next door to see if I could find anything that might make her feel any better, when I stumbled upon this while just looking around the tea aisle.  I'm not really much of a natural remedies kind of guy and don't worship crystals... but this just seemed to be too much of a coincidence.  I had to try...!  I made her some back at the room and she felt much better in just a few minutes!  Over the following months, I would make her a cup whenever she was feeling badly.  It really worked!<br /><br />Later, over the years, we recommended or gave this to friends and acquaintances struggling with nausea.  We gave it to one lady who was pregnant and having awful morning sickness.  It worked so well for her, she went right out and bought her own supply!<br /><br />This week, my wife is sick again and we ran out. I couldn't find any locally!

They're easy, they dissolve perfectly and are delicious. Just the right sweetness and coffee taste, in my opinion.

Maybe it's hard to imagine, but one of the reasons snacks are generally so salty is that the saltiness makes you crave more. These seem to lack that ""crack factor"", while still being really great treats to munch on.<br /><br />Not sure what the other reviewer is talking about... If they were that gross, you would RETURN THEM, not throw them out. I think it might be a false review, given how completely wacky it sounds.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are familiar with any variety of somersaults, the pepper are a good option to try. I will say I was expecting ""bigger chunks"" of peppercorn - these are misted in very fine grain pepper, which means you get all the heat spread throughout each nugget, but not as much strong pepper-spice flavor.<br /><br />Only negative was I did find a single nugget that seemed coated with about a millimeter thick coating of pepper, so perhaps there are manufacturing issues that may cause per-bag variances? Anyway, I'm hooked!","Just the right heat, without too much ""spiciness""",5
"A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.",A Rich Flower Garden in Bloom.,5

Wow! I would be willing to pay $15 for a burger this good at a restaurant. The next thing that I put in on was a natural casing Polish sausage and it was wonderful.

"With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product! The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.",My 12 cats like this product just fine (details),5

"There are a lot of Chili Sauces that I like, and it really depends on what I want to use it for, but when it comes to cooking, this is the stuff. I add it to any meat to make stir-fry, chili con carne, Thai dishes, burritos, etc. It's wonderfully versatile and can be used anywhere that garlic and chilies are appropriate. One of the reasons it's so perfect for cooking is because it's not all heat. You can add a good tablespoon of this to a dish and really mix it in without killing it. With, say, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBFTC6"">Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper</a> sauce you get lots of heat in a few drops, which can lead to uneven flavor in the dish.",Best Chili Sauce for cooking,5

I desperately asked the waitress where i can find it, contemplated stealing the bottle but thought better of it, and she told me they sell it at Vons!!!  So i picked up a couple bottles of different flavors, and they were spent in just over a months time!  It has that nice peppery flavor that often gets masked with too much spice, when compared to other hot sauces.  The flavor comes out, not just the heat, making this my favorite hot sauce!!!  I like to have it on hard boiled eggs mixed with mustard, i use with any marinade as well to add some heat.",delightful!,5

"I'm the owner of a year and a half old beagle boy.  He's the love of my life and when I got him from our local rescue they emphasized how important a proper diet of a premium dog food is.  I'm not one to be sucked into the belief that if it costs more, it's better.  That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.",Great choice for the active young dog!,5

"I have always been loyal to this Singaporean brand. Gold Kili makes a lot of instant beverage products. They are particularly popular with their Ginger beverage selections and I think it is because their ginger tastes very authentic, like the real thing from Asia. Lots of teas out there are just Ginger flavored but this is actually made from real pieces of actual ginger. It might be strong for some you can always adjust it by adding more/less water.

I ordered this in mid October 2009.  The bags were dated February 2009.<br /><br />A friend of mine had visited this region of Guatemala and had brought me back some of the coffee beans from his trip.  I was astounded by how the coffee lacked the bitterness you can find in most other coffees.  There also seems to be some hints of cherries or some other nutty/fruity flavor.  I have used multiple grind settings when using this (drip coffee maker) and found that it tolerates a very fine grind well.  The looser grinds and small amounts of the coffee can leave this weak though.<br /><br />Highly recommend this coffee.,Mild and flavorful,5

"I have been going through the various brands of coconut water. Taste Nirvana is now officially my favorite. One reason: it literally tastes like water right out of a coconut. If you are not a fan of coconut flavor, opt for another brand. Second reason: I like the serving size: each can has 16.2 ounces of coconut water (I found the 11 ounce containers of most other brands to be a little short when I am hot and thirsty). I also like that I can easily recycle the can in my area.<br /><br />To date the only down-side is that it is not always readily available from Amazon. Since I frequently work in the heat (which, here in Texas, runs from April to Halloween) I have to have a ready supply of coconut water.

Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!",My favorite Green Tea,5

"Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood.",soothing,5
"Great cookies.  Not overly sweet as most American cookies can be, with a hint of citrus.  Could not ask for more.  There is only 12 or so cookies in the box, but a decadent treat.",Yummy!,5
"I'd had a box of this sitting in my pantry for two years, and I finally tried it last week.  I now refer to it as my 'lazy woman's risotto'.  It is effortless to prepare, and, when I leave it a little moist and lightly toss it with a little grated cheese (I prefer Cotija hard Mexican cheese), it tastes ands feels like a creamy buttery risotto (without any of the work)!  I serve it with curries and hearty tomato-based vegetable stews.",a hidden treasure!,5
"I read an article last year about people in other countries who live to a great old age, without heart disease and cancer. One culture managed this, according to the article, by drinking as many as 5 cups of raw cocoa per day. I was interested in the possible health benefits, so after some research I discovered Navitas Cacao on Amazon and placed my order. We've been hooked ever since...Read the label.(BTW, this product has fiber in it. It took us a while to adjust our diets accordingly and for our bodies to adjust to the extra fiber.) We consume, on average, around 2 cups of hot cocoa each, per day.<br />I have priced it in health food stores and have yet to find such a good deal as Amazon offers.<br />As for the product, it really has changed our lives. We have never looked forward to a cup of anything as much as we look forward to a cup of hot cocoa made with this powder. (I know it contributed to me losing 30 pounds last year.) It is energizing,delicious and satisfying....and my husband loves it as much as I do! My favorite way to drink it is in a cup of hot (organic) milk with a tablespoon or two of (raw unprocessed) honey.  (You have to stir it extra well.) You can also bake with it, add it to coffee for a cafe mocha beverage, etc. AND it's low-calorie! If you love chocolate, this is the ultimate in pure chocolate bliss. Don't expect it to be sweet. This is dark; no sugar added.",Pure Cacao Powder by Navitas,5

"I've tried a variety of Earl Grey blends, and this one wins the prize for being the most unique. The citrus flavor is noticeably different from other Earl Greys. The box says that in addition to bergamont, other citrus flavors have been added. Personally, I taste a touch of grapefruit in the mix, which makes this tea a bit more lively than your typical blend. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my goto is Bigelow's. I find Twinings to be too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.",Unique Earl Grey,5

Popchips are really a great snack and not just an alternative to regular chips but a full on replacement as far as I'm concerned. The taste and texture are great for the Jalapeno ones.

Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more!

I'm pretty picky about what my cats are fed.  While I have never eaten it myself - my clan of 4 all approve this flavor of Weruva.  My only real problem with it is that the calorie count per can is very low compared to other brands.  This food is pretty pricey anyway and it takes a lot of it to fill them up.  I wish the water content wasn't so high or they calorie content was better so I felt I was getting more value for the money I am spending on this food.,Kitties Approve,5
This has got to be a new drink that will finally give Coke a run for its money in my house.  I cannot believe or describe how good it is.  It makes the standard run of the mill Black Cherry drinks pale by comparison.  My only complaint is that it didn't come in a 12 ounce can!,Truly outstanding!!,5
"Ferrara Pan Candy Company was founded in 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. It makes many small and tasty candies including Lemonheads (oh yeah!), Atomic Fireballs, Boston Baked Beans, and now Chewy Lemonhead & Friends! They look like the Lemonheads line (Lemonhead, Cherryheads, Appleheads and Grapeheads), but unlike them are soft and chewy.<br /><br />I found them to be quite tasty - sweet and enough tart to give them a little more zing than your run-of-the-mill fruit candies. I think that they are really very good, and a nice addition to the Ferrara Pan product line.<br /><br />(I do understand that they must seal them up better these day, but I must admit I do miss the old boxes that you could blow through and make noises with!)",Quite tasty,5

"My son has several allergies.  We were looking for anything that we could use that would pass as bread for his school lunches.  We were just hoping that it would be good enough, but we were surprised with Chebe.  It is actually very good.  We all liked it.  With the second batch we tried to make, the dough came out very sticky.  We called Chebe customer service and they helped us figure out the problem.  Very fast and friendly.  They even replaced the goofed up batch.  It is perfect for sandwiches at lunch and with jelly on it for breakfast.",Very Good,5
"After reading a number of confusing reviews that highlight LARGE discrepancies in sugars, organics and nutrition contents, I decided to investigate for myself.<br /><br />I compared Earth's Best Apple snack bars (my little guy's favorite) with Health Valley Apple Cobble cereal bars and Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Apple Cinnamon.<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />Earth's Best snack bars are KID-sized. Only 19g.<br /><br />The other two are 37g each.<br /><br />As most parents know, having things in smaller packages is handy because kids often don't eat all of what you give them. So unless you always remember to carry extra baggies or storage containers around, Earth's Best has the no-waste edge.<br /><br />***For the rest of this review, the numbers I give for Earth's best are based on a doubling of serving size from 19g to 38g so as to be on relative equal footing with the other two bars***<br /><br />Sugars:<br /><br />Nutri-Grain (NG): 12g<br /><br />Health Valley (HV): 16g<br /><br />Earth's Best (E'sB): 18g<br /><br />So, yes, Earth's best does have the highest sugar content of the three, but that's assuming your child will eat the whole 37/38g worth of bar.<br /><br />Mine won't.<br /><br />And, if you consider the source of the sugars (which, believe it or not, matters to some people), Health Valley and Earth's Best derive theirs primarily from evaporated can juice, honey, and the apple itself.<br /><br />Nutri-Grain lists high-fructose corn syrup and plain ol' sugar almost a dozen ingredients before you actually see 'apple puree' listed.<br /><br />One final sugar note, when ANY kind of fruit is reduced to a concentrate, its level of sugar (fructose) becomes concentrated as well. That's why it may take a whole apple to equal the same amount of sugar found in a couple of tablespoons of the concentrated apple found in a  processed snack.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Just a reminder, what's listed first on the ingredients label is what the product contains the most of, and so on down to the bottom.<br /><br />If you think your child is eating an apple snack bar, then apple should be the first thing list, not near the last.<br /><br />Organics:<br /><br />Read the labels thoroughly.<br /><br />Healthy Vally claims 70% organic.<br /><br />Earth's Best claims made with Organic Whole Wheat.<br /><br />Neither of these items claims to be 'ORGANIC' in its entirety. So don't be miffed if you see the word and think it means the whole product only to find out it doesn't.<br /><br />Other Nutrition consideration:<br /><br />Fiber: This is the one truly weak point of Earth's Best. It list NONE. The other two each list 3g. Now, I'm not 100% certain that 0g for the E'sB 19g serving also means 0g for a double serving, but it's safe to assume that it would still be less than 1g.<br /><br />Vitamins: E'sB wins this one. Narrowly beating out Nutri-grain with added Zinc, Iron, Thiamin and Folic Acid, though a tad less on Riboflavin and Niacin.<br /><br />Health Valley has modest amounts of vitamins, but nothing to compare with the other two.<br /><br />This said, if you're the kind of parent who is truly concerned about a well-balanced diet, you know that the value of vitamins from these sources isn't as good as getting them from fresh fruits and vegetables, so don't bank on these bars as a multivitamin alternative.<br /><br />Sodium:<br /><br />NG: 110mg<br /><br />HV: 85mg<br /><br />E'sB: 90mg (45mg/19g)<br /><br />Protein:<br /><br />At the 37/38g serving size, all offer 2g.<br /><br />Total carbs:<br /><br />NG: 24g (8%)<br /><br />HV: 27g (9%)<br /><br />E'sB: 28g (9%)...but 14g/19g serving size<br /><br />Calories:<br /><br />NG: 120<br /><br />HV: 130<br /><br />E'sB: 140...70/19g serving size<br /><br />And an added note on calories: kids are active little things and hardly want to sit to eat or do anything to take away from their play/work.<br /><br />While I do prefer to give my little guy as much 'fresh' stuff as possible (and I give him a fair amount), he fills up on it, but burns through the energy (i.e. calories) quickly and is loathe to pause long to eat again.<br /><br />This said, when you can find a SMALL, tasty supplemental snack that's relatively healthy and also packs on the calories for your little one, then you often stick with it.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />If cost is the most important factor when choosing a cereal bar, then, yes, Nutri-Grain is likely your best bet.<br /><br />If convenience of size and nutritional content drive you (despite cost), then Earth's Best is definitely the way to go.<br /><br />Health Valley has it's taste merits, but lacks in other ways.<br /><br />I 100% believe of the value of paying a little more for Earth's Best smaller bars because it provides a compact, calorie and nutrient rich snack that is fairly healthy.",Best for the little ones...,5

"These little packets have everything you need to make commercial-quality popcorn.  Two pouches in each packet:  one with popcorn and flavored salt (flavacol, or something just like it), and one with that bright orange oil (solid at room temperature).  The yellow color, the flavor and the salt all find their way into the popcorn.  If you like the ""butter"" stuff they squirt on at the theater, that's a separate purchase.  You might want to consult your doctor.<br /><br />The 2.5 oz. packets are made for the baby-sized commercial-style machines, and they produce a smallish batch, about enough for one person.  I got one of these for Christmas, and now I wish I got a bigger model, at least a 4-oz. popper.  The little tub loses too many kernels during popping.  Plus, the small size makes it tough to clean and load the tub.  Anyway, the popcorn is great.  If you are an occasional popcorn eater, these packets are incredibly handy.  If you make a few batches a week, though, you might want to invest in a big tub of the oil and a box of flavacol, which should save money in the long run.","Yes, this is the stuff you're looking for.",5
"These are great, only wish I had tried them earlier.  I had originally put off purchasing these thinking I wouldn't use them, but I was wrong.

"We can't change our dog's diet much.  Unfortunately he is highly food motivated and loves to visit our local hardware for treats.  In fact, he keeps a supply at the hardware.

He liked them but we didn't notice an improvement in his symptoms so I tried these.  After all, apples and yogurt are some of my boy's favorite things!<br /><br />He loves these treats.  Although his symptoms have not cleared up entirely, they did improve.  His friend at the hardware likes to feed him a lot of treats at once so we consider them well tested at this point and we just ordered our third box.  Dogs like 'em and mom approves!",Buster Loves Yogurt and Apples,5

"I am not a dog, but my pug seems to like the food. I decided to choose this food because of the quality of the manufacturer. So far the dog loves the food, and the transition from the old to the new has not caused any problems.

"I love K-Cups coffee.  They are easy and one always has a FRESH cup of coffee in less than a minute.  However, coffee this way can be quite expensive.  I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.  I'd pay twice as much for that feature alone.",I like it for my little wife,5
Nice product,Mind-blowing purchase,5
It was all I had expected from this drink. come to find out it's also available in a variety of other flavors.  I would recommend it to all.  I bought a case and now know its also available locally at Target!! Yeah  just not in bulk.  A def. good buy!,Satisfied completely with Amazon purchase,5
"The thought of having a manual egg beater has escaped the thought of many. This manual egg beater, however, is great! There is no catching when you use the handle.. it operates very smoothly.

"I have also tried the regular Lowrey's microwavable rinds, and both are good!  I love that they can sit on the shelf for weeks and then be microwaved quickly into a warm snack.  The hot and spicy isn't overdone - there is some heat, but you can still taste the rinds.  The heat is just enough to slow you down so you don't consume the whole bag in less than five minutes.<br /><br />I also love to hear the crackle sound when you pull them from the microwave.  It adds to the experience.  :)",Good snack,5
very useful,Excellent,5
"My dog loves them.  She is a 50 lb aussie and these are just the right size.  She clearly prefers them to any others we have given her... and this dog has gone through many bones in her day!  They are much thicker rawhide than some of the cheap ones you can get at the grocery store.  I like that they are natural too.  A little pricey, but my baby is worth it.",my dog loves these,5

"I love strawberry jello. The great thing about this is its fine taste for a diet jello. The fact that you can eat this with a dollop of cool whip and not take in enough calories to sneeze about, is just wonderful.<br /><br />It's a staple of my diet.

I expected the consistency to be like that of Hot Fries but they are actually really smooth. You get a ton of them in the bag, too. I usually don't like to buy the 100 calorie Oreo packs because half the bag is air and you're still hungry afterwards but that's not the case with these. Full bag, full of flavor, full belly.

"We've had dogs that wouldn't have a thing to do with Nylabones, but what works great is early training.  Start the puppy out on the puppy nylabones.  Follow instructions and help the pup's interest level by smearing some peanut butter on it, and so on.<br /><br />The first time we saw a Galileo Bone,  we were mystified,  but the sales clerk said he had one and it lasted years!  And guess what?  It did!  Our dog is over 8 years old now,  and has two Galileo's.  He doesn't chew on them constantly,  but whenever he feels like it.  It helps keep his molars free of tartar and satisfies his craving to chew.<br /><br />One of the bone's 3 tips was getting chewed waaaay close to the stump and finally broke off.  According to instructions,  that's the time to retire it and get a new one.<br /><br />I've paid over $20 each for these and feel they were worth it at that price.  Now they are almost half that.  Good deal.<br /><br />Natural (real) bones are dangerous and rawhide chews can get stuck in the throat,  swell in the stomach and even cause bowel impaction.  Don't use them.  If you insist,  supervise the dog so you can assist if the above problems happen.  It has happened to us.<br /><br />But use Nylabones and don't worry about it!  It may take some training at first,  maybe not.  If it does,  it's worth it.",Great product!,5

"Very happy with all of Wellness products. When my black labrador got constant ear infections that would not clear up with medications I decided it could be allergies.

"My cat is very picky with her food. We used to feed her dry food with an occasional treat of wet food but now we are changing it to dry food in the morning and a can of wet food in the evening. Fancy feast classic is in pate form which my cat prefers. We usually get these in fish or seafood flavor, as she gets her chicken from the dry food. We have tried other brands and textures with my cat, and this is the one that she likes best. The pate is easier to eat for her. She hates the ones which have chunky pieces and will refuse to eat them. The smell of the food is strong too which cats like. This strong smell came in handy for us when we were trying to pill the cat. We crushed the pill(we checked to see that it was safe to do so) and mixed it with ff and she gobbled it up without any hassle. FF is my cat's fav food!!!",Cat loves FF,5

Just bought a bag of Canidae with the new formula.  I had some of the old Canidae formula and am mixing in with some of the new formula.  The new formula has more meat in it and my puppy loves the new formula!  He jumped on it!

"Many people need to reduce salt intake and this has been the best solution for me. Very versatile. I sometimes bring some to a restaurant and order my food unseasoned.<br /><br />I got turned on to basalmic glaze when Trader Joes carried their own brand which was great... but they discontinued it due to problems with the cap. And I suspect some customers like me hoarded some, reducing apparent demand for long stretches. The cap and no spill dispensing on De Nigris brand is first rate.<br /><br />I bought Roland and De Nigris, and one other. The Roland one comes in several quality levels, the highest of which is hard to find and expensive. I am on this site to buy more De Nigris Basalmic Glaze Reduction because it provides the best taste and the price is right in a good sized bottle.",Excellent taste and good as a salt substitute,5

"I bought this toy for my dog to keep him busy while I run out the door to work.  He used to get upset when I left, but now he knows he will get this to play with.  He figured out really quickly how to use it and it keeps him entertained for at least 10-15 minutes while I escape.  It is very easy to clean.  One thing I wanted to point out is that the small is rather large.  My collie is huge and he uses the small.  I think the large would be too big for him.  I just put about a quarter of a cup in it although the small holds about 2 cups.  I guess if you wanted to feed a very large dog an huge meal you might need a large, but then it might be too heavey for the dog to play with.",I love this toy...,5

"This product is too expensive for what you get... It's great stuff but the price is too high for everyday use of this product.  I got the packets at the health food store 35 packets for $[...]. That's too expensive. And the funny thing is it is in an oversized box so  you think your are getting more than 35 packets. I assumed it was 80 packets enclosed but when I got home and opened the box I was a bit pissed off because the packets barely  lined the bottom of the box. I don't know why they put so little in such a big box... no wait, I do know why... they want to mislead the public into thinking they are getting more than 35 packets for [...] bucks!  I do love the taste and the fact that it is organic and comes from organic sugar cane. Most other erythritol comes from non-organic corn. As far as I can tell this is the only product made from organic sugar cane. I've called almost every company too! If they just could lower the price I'd be a happy camper!

"When you live in Kalamazoo it can be difficult to get taco shells without preservatives.Sounds weird I know. Even so I was delighted to see Little Bear Shells on Amazon. Unfortunately, there was a severe communication issue. My shells arrived -- 1 box of 12 shells. I called customer service and tried to explain that more than $20 for one box of taco shells was crazy and that clearly there were supposed to be 12 boxes of 12 shells each or 144 shells in my order. The rep did not understand. She was confused by my complaint, after all the site said 12 and I had received 12. We agreed to disagree. To her credit, she was very kind about refunding the money. I may order these shells again (they are yummy tasting) but I'll wait until they change the number in the package or the number of packages in the order.",12 or 144,5

"I had been offering my housecats the Fancy Feast canned foods with the Fancy Feast kibble always available.  My black Coonie-mix cat would regularly vomit up the clearly identifiable, undigested, highly dyed, cutesy shaped, Fancy Feast bits (usually on my cream colored carpet!)  This cat also had already had to have one tooth extracted and I wanted to try to feed him something that would set better on his tummy.  After doing some web researching, I ordered our first bag of Royal Canin Indoor Mature Cat 27 a month ago.  We went through the gradual change over thing but I don't think it was really needed as the new food was readily accepted.  The first bag has been eaten and joy, and the upchucking has ceased!!! Even his  hairball ""gifts"" are getting smaller and much more infrequent.<br /><br />My other Maine Coon is 12 and oddly enough, hairballs never seemed to bother her but, she was eating less and less.  She was becoming less active and just didn't seem to be interested in eating kibble or canned and she was noticably loosing weight! Her vet said she could be heading towards a thyroid problem but he wasn't ready to put her on medication yet.  I am happy to report that my sweet girl has really taken to this Indoor Mature Cat 27 diet.  It is helping her get back to her normal, Maine Coon size and she does seem to be feeling much better, even joining in on some playtime with the young'uns!<br /><br />Who knew a change of diet could work such wonders?  Clearly, the attitude of ""kibble is kibble"" is out the window.  How could I ever return to feeding my cats a food that would make them vomit?!",Cat with Sensitive Stomach Stopped Vomiting!,5

"I don't think everything from China is crappy, though I do think it pays to be vigilant EVERYWHERE these days.  But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place - it just means they're in a barn (usually without light) - check out Food, Inc. and many other documentaries.  If it were natural for my dogs, I'd have them go vegan too, but right now I do what I can with the humans in our family and try to pick what seems to be the least harmful to all other sentient creatures sharing this planet.<br />So that being said, this product compares to other chicken jerky products for dogs out there just fine and to boot does not have hormones.  Also, the individual slices are thinner than many other brands which helps the dogs chew these properly (fewer larger chunks swallowed).  The price is great to boot - I highly recommend these and will be buying more (at least until there is some healthy vegan jerky for dogs that I can afford!)","My dogs are loving these, thinly sliced so easy to chew",5

But as you continue it grows on you quickly. I tend to like my tea on the stronger side, so the next glass may use 2 packets instead of 1 and slightly more water.

"Yes, C is for cookie, but Mmmm is for Mallomars, and that's good enough for me! I used to love to eat Mallomars when I was a kid growing up in New York City. I hadn't had one for years--probably decades--till I ordered a box through Amazon.<br /><br />Look, it's not whole grain, it's not nutritious, it doesn't have pomegranate juice or açai--probably not even enough antioxidants from the dark chocolate covering to protect the heart of an amoeba. But it is good.<br /><br />I decided that when I did my taste test, the first thing I would notice was whether it had a ""pure chocolate"" taste or not. After all, it's printed right there on the box: ""Pure Chocolate Mallomars."" I expected to get that chemical aftertaste of highly processed chocolate you often get in lower-priced products. I have to say it was a good, pure chocolate taste. I tasted the chocolate, I felt the familiar squish of the marshmallow in my mouth, I felt the slight crunch of the base-layer cookie, swirled it around in my mouth (little or no chewing necessary), and then gulped it down.<br /><br />Not satisfied that I had actually done the taste test justice, I decided to try it again.<br /><br />Same thing. Good tasting for a little snack. I had to try it just one more time just to make sure. Yep, it was still good the third time.<br /><br />Recommended, but not nutritious. The one complaint I have is that about 4 or 5 of the cookies had split during shipping, somewhere along the way. The bottom wafer had come apart from the covered-marshmallow part, either mostly or entirely separated from the larger part of the snack. They should figure that one out. Although it still tasted good, I think people like to see their cookies intact when they open the package.",Mmm Is for Mallomars,5

"I love this tea. I love the smooth feel of the individually sealed envelopes, I love the red of the box, I love the fragrance as it steeps, and I REALLY love the taste. It is just amazingly good, definitely worth the stained teeth.<br /><br />Occasionally I will warm up some milk in my mug (filled about halfway, I'd say) and let the teabag steep while the water is getting hot. Once I take the teabag out I just add some sugar and am ready to go.<br /><br />If you love tea, if you love gently but wonderfully spiced foods - try this. I am very glad that I found it.","Totally terrific tea, truly.",5
"I've tried a lot of KCups, looking for the fresh, dark, really rich espresso-roast flavor that I love; all of them seemed weak and/or flatly bitter compared to my dark beans-by-the-pound favorites. I'm almost a coffee snob and only bought the Keurig because my mornings are just too rushed, sort of a shocking decision. I love the convenience of the machine, but it was like grabbing a cup at the convenience store taste-wise - just the required morning medication, eh.<br /><br />So I was really, really surprised and delighted when I discovered this one. I hear they pack the Barista blends with more coffee - that does seem to be the case, they're plump little cuppies.<br />And wow, a real espresso taste, zero acidity, darkly fruity and full-bodied, and for once not tasting watered down. If you don't like espresso you won't like it, especially neat. But with half and half and sugar this one's really wonderful, too.  Love it, love it.","Yes, finally!",5

"We have three dogs- a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear, and two large dogs with health issues: a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago, and an 8 year old  collie mix who has irritable bowels.  Trying to find the right food so that I didn't have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy, but this Wellness Simple Solutions, along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job.<br /><br />If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach/bowel reactions, as any pediatrician will tell you, feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible, and only add ingredients as needed, after waiting for a time to watch for reactions.  Simple Solutions is the way to do this, and for a dog with irritable bowels, it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food, instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog.  The dogs love the taste, and Wellness brand is excellent quality.",Excellent dog food; especially good for dogs with health problems,5
"I have bought some of the jarred/canned cooking sauces and not been all that impressed.  I bought this a while back and it's been sitting in my pantry.  I finally got around to trying it and was blown away.  I used a pound of shrimp, a handful or two of cashews, and coconut milk instead of water.  Yummy!!!  I may try making a potato curry using a bag of those pre-diced-potatoes-with-onion (not sure if I can Simply say the brand name :-) that you find in the deli case at the supermarket.  I think that will be good too.  And more economical.","Wow, this is great.",5

"I got this Dinner of the Month Club pasta meal as a gift from a very special person back in CT where I used to live--I believe they are one of the leading gourmet presents companies nationwide.<br />The pasta is ready literally within 15 minutes--a quick meal is a good thing, especially for a single guy like me who doesn't have the time of day to cook complicated stuff--and not only that, it tastes excellent! (I added some parmesan cheese to the sauces that I got in my fridge and it made it even better). Honestly I wasn't expecting it to taste this good. As an Italian food fan, I was pretty satisfied with this gift. If you don't want to leave the house or what to stay home to watch the game, it's a perfect gift. Do I recommend their food and services? Absolutely! Giving gifts like these are a good idea for single people like me, so I am thinking returning the favor and sending these to some people I know for the upcoming holidays.",Dinner for Every Month,5

"An avid home cook that is a collector of both cookbooks and cooking gadgets writes this review.  My husband and I have been following the ""Eat to Live"" plan for about 4 months now.  I purchased this product to give the illusion of meat in my chili and marinara sauce.  Both my husband and I were dubious about how this product would taste and what the texture would be.  We were both pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have summarized my observations of this product below:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Very easy to use<br /><br />2. Can be stored in the cupboard while dry<br /><br />3. Texture is very similar to ground meat<br /><br />4. Absorbs the flavor of the sauce it is placed in<br /><br />5. Soy product, which is good for your health<br /><br />6. Good source of vegetable protein<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. It isn't going to fool anyone that it is beef or pork it used alone, but it does replicate the texture<br /><br />Overall I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a vegetable protein.  I have used it both in chili and marinara sauce.  I plan to try adding it to my lentil veggie burgers where I think it will work fine.  I have been pleasantly surprised by this product and would recommend it to anyone that is trying to reduce the saturated fat that his or her family is consuming.  If you aren't vegan I would suggest that you mix the rehydrated TVP into meatballs, and hamburgers.  I can't imagine that your family would even know that it is there if you used a 50/50 mix.","Much, much better than I expected !",5

"I saw these on sale at a local store and only bought one because I wasn't sure I'd like them. Wrong! They were GREAT and I loved them! Couldn't wait to get more. The portion could be small for some, but for me it isn't. And only 80 calories for all of it? I could not believe that. The tuna salad is slightly sweet with some little veggie chunks in it, really creamy, too. The can opens easy (like a foil on top) and the salad seems to match up to the 6 crackers nicely! I need to get more, only have 3 left! I highly recommend these, but I do know stuff like this is a taste preference, but I am very happy!",Perfect light lunch!,5

"I think these noodles are the best discovery ever!!!!  Yes, when you open it, they do smell fishy, HOWEVER, when you eat, no fishy taste at all.  I am doing the Ideal Protein Diet which has a lot of limitations and if I didn't discover these noodles to eat, it would have not been easy to stay on this diet.  The best way I found to make these noodles is stir fried with veggies.  The more water you can remove with paper towels, the better they taste IMO.  Great product that I wish I can get locally.  I find myself ordering these noodles every other week.  My picky 12 year old son who is on a gluten free diet thinks they are great too.  I make a marinara sauce with shrimp and throw over noodles and he loves it.  Great product!",Amazing!,5

These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.  Yummy.,Tasty,5

The Penguin Bar is probably my favorite chocolate Cookie or Biscuit . It is a smooth refreshing treat . I found these a couple years ago at a local Celtic shop and have been getting the ever since . They are Two rich chocotlate biscuits with a nice layer of smooth chocolate filling between them and covered in a superb chocolate iceing . Now I find most choclates give you a warm feeling in your mouth after eating them . This bar does the exact opposite . It leaves your mouth feeling cool and refreshing . The biscuits literally melt in your mouth . They might be a bit expensive but once you try them you will know it was well worth the price .,Smooth and tasty,5

"The delivery man laughed when he shook the box and I told him it was ""macaroni"" but, oh, yes, these are worth ordering online.  They are toothsome and flavorful.  I was reminded how flavorful recently when I mixed in with these the last of a box of another pasta.  In the bowl, the differences were obvious.  Compared to these, the other pasta was mushy and flavorless.<br /><br />An added bonus?  When I did the math and with free Prime shipping, these were the same price they would be in the supermarket if we could get them here.",My favorite boxed pasta,5

I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too.

"My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.<br /><br />  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I don't particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folger's bags.<br /><br />  They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I'm not any kind of coffee expert, so I don't know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.<br /><br />  Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in-room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.<br /><br />Jerry",Brews an excellent cup of coffee quickly and easily,5

At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars. I'm torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price. One of each makes a good cheap lunch @ $1.60.,tasty,5

"I really dig on cacao. I add the powder to my smoothie every day for the antioxidant benefit as well as being a natural stimulant which is more subtle and longer lasting than caffeine.<br /><br />I bought the nibs too as they provide a great crunch (to smoothies or raw) and all the benefits of cacao powder however with slightly lower efficacy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cacao powder (and the nibs) as a great and tasty addition to your diet.<br /><br />These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA, but this is an amazon review, don't take it too seriously folks.",Never felt better since adding cacao to my diet,5

"This is far and away my favorite of the KIND bars. They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket.

"Bought CatSip years ago as a treat for our picky cat.  Unfortunately for us, she loves it!<br /><br />This product causes no digestive issues for our cat.  The color of the milk is a definite off-white / light tan, so don't be alarmed if trying it for the first time.  Although the box is small (juice box size), each one lasts us a week or so.  Refrigerate after opening (refrigeration is not required prior to opening).<br /><br />It is difficult to find.  Petsmart is the only local store that sells it.  I really wish Amazon would stock this instead of the one in the purple box.  We tried the other brand once when we couldn't find CatSip -- she wouldn't touch the stuff; just kept walking around, crying for the CatSip.  In a pinch, we also tried a tiny bit of real milk once but she really didn't want any part of that either.",Picky Cat Adores CatSip,5

There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.

"Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors.

I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch.

"I am currently doing the HcG Diet and cannot have anything extra with calories, fat, or sugar.  This barbeque sauce is perfect!!!  I used it last night and WOW! It tastes so good!  It's not thick like traditional bbq sauce, but it is for dieters.  It's sweetened with Sucralose which is an HCG diet no-no, however I didn't stall.  It is tangy, sweet, and barbequey.  I couldn't ask for more.  I have tried Walden Farms Balsamic Vinagrette (which is good), the Honey Dijon (yuck), the Sesame Ginger (so-so), the Ranch (yuck), Peanut Spread (sweet, but not peanut butter tasting), and the Blueberry Jam (good) and I have to say that so far this is the best that they have to offer for dieters.  I don't understand the 1 stars people are leaving (they probably aren't really dieting!).  My coworkers who are also doing the HCG Diet along with me LOVE this bbq sauce, they almost stole my bottle.  I am ordering more now so I don't run out!!!",HcG Diet Phase 2 MUST!!!,5

"I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention. They've perfected Stevia a great deal since the early days when I would dip a toothpick into the bottle and still use too much. It's still easy to use too much, and I've gotten pretty good at judging when a whole packet is called for or whether to sprinkle out less into my drink or whatever.<br /><br />I grow Stevia, just because I grow herbs, and it's a nice plant to have, but I've not been successful at drying the leaves for my own use. Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.<br /><br />There are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea. I just know I can't use the artificial sweeteners like aspartame as they immediately give me migraines, as does anything sweetened with corn syrup. I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me. Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.",Only one I use,5

I've been recommending this cracker to my clients forever, and was shocked to learn that recently they were no longer carried in supermarkets.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I bought a pack of ten boxes and have been giving them to my clients --and of course keeping some for myself.

"I was really tired of going through all of the recalls & not knowing if or when either my dog or myself was going to get sick! I have bought the best dog foods on the market literally and nothing even came close to making my very picky Australian Cattle Dog happy. Then a friend suggested that I try Annamaet.  The day I took it out of the mailbox, he started jumping up & down bumping the box with his nose - I figured that he was only trying to amuse me.  So, we did the usual routine: Take a little of the food put it in the bowl & see if I get the evil stare, bent ears and disgusted look as if to say ""Really, are you kidding me?"" Not this time! When he saw that I had some of that wonderful smelling food in my hand, he immediately sat down and barked - he actually ate it out of my hand. His coat is incredibly soft & shiny and he looks great.  Also, he does not shed or blow his coat hardly at all like a normal blue heeler. I can not say enough about this food - I only wish that there was a store that sold it in my state, but that's ok - I will continue to order through amazon.",Best Food EVER,5

"I used Enfamil RTF with my first son and I now use it with my second son.  It's a great product and a great value.  The 8 oz. size is perfect for traveling or just on the go.  It's more convenient than toting around a 32 oz. can.  My son seems to really enjoy it.  I tried the Newborn formula, but since it only comes in 2 oz. RTF and powder, I opted to switch to Infant which is available in more convenient RTF sizes and my little one had little to no problems when we made the switch...maybe a little gas the first couple of days, but can't be sure it was from the formula.",Great Product,5
