I ordered tulips for my wife because they are her favorite flower.<br /><br />Instead of the 30 Multicolored tulips I ordered she receives a dozen roses. REALLY dont you think if I wanted to order a dozen roses I would have done that.<br /><br />Whats next AMAZON and Pro Flowers?!?!? Maybe you will substitute a flaming bag of dog excrement for my next order.<br /><br />So far today 2 of my three orders from you have been nothing like what I ordered. If I wanted a surprise package or a mystery gift I would have ordered that.<br /><br />I am disgusted with this shopping experience.<br /><br />EPIC FAIL!!!,YET ANOTHER EPIC FAIL,1

"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me.",Kettle Brand Potato Chips - New York Cheddar,1
"I'd heard about this on triple D and a few other places, and thought, ""Well, if they're ranting THIS MUCH, it must be GREAT."" Nah.<br /><br />Used it on chicken TWICE (the reviews I'd read slobbered all over how good it was supposed to be with chicken), and it SUCKED. Not that it was nauseating, it just had no flavor at all. We have a pretty broad palate--like all kinds of foods--but this had  no real flavor profile at all. I've read it described as 'lemony', etc.: don't you believe it. I loaded the food up with lemon and this stuff, and it pretty much...just lay there.<br /><br />Frankly: we grew up poor and couldn't afford too many spices or extras, and my mom's roast chicken with JUST salt, pepper and butter rocked WAAAAAAAAY more than this. Save your money is my instinct. I still plan to try it mixed with some other herbs, so I'll update, and hopefully find a recipe or two that is worth the investment.<br /><br />The company DOES give you a LOT for your money, in the way of sheer amount of the spice that they send you. I'd be very open to anyone here who wanted to send me recipes or ways to use it that might change my initial impression. So look out for future updates.","Um, no.",1

"I am not going to get into the nutritional side of this product because Brenda has done an outstanding job of covering that. The woman knows her dog food! I am simply going to tell you our dogs opinion of the taste quality:<br /><br />Beckham is a two year old whippet who is more pup than dog. He typically eats Purina One for meals, meaty bones and pigs ears for snacks and a denta-bites for his teeth. His breeder (who I am sure was glad to see the backside of Beckham) recommended the above, well, okay not the pigs ears but that is just so deliciously disgusting to impose on the kids. Beckham has also been known to eat grass, slugs, deer poo and other revolting items. What Beckham will not eat is Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. Said Sirloin has been hand fed to Beckham, hidden in with his standard kibble and offered as a treat for not pulling on walks. Nope, nope, nope, Beckham is not having it.

"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare.","IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky",1

"After reading the ingredients list on this product  I know I will never buy or drink any. I would be telling anyone I can how unhealthy this drink is. Whey protein is a debatable protein source. I prefer a protein powder such as hemp. It is easily digested and mixes well with liquids. The only way soy is healthful is if it is fermented, like tofu. This product contains 18 grams of sugar, which is very high. The carbohydrates are also high at 29 grams. The cocoa is processed with alkali. There are mono and diglycerides in this drink. The vitamin k1 that is used is not very absorbable and not recommended by those who understand vitamin k and which source is most usable by the human body. If I am going to spend good money on a product it will be for something that supports good health.

"I am working on my second Cherry Tomato seed kit. After about three months, the first crop provided about eight Cherry tomatoes. Hardly a bumper crop. During the growth I had to clean out the pump which got clogged with roots (more on that latter). So I figured, ok, I had to disturb the root system when I had to clean out the pump, so perhaps that was the problem.<br /><br />I started a second crop of Cherry Tomatoes about three months ago. So far, I have had one marble sized yellow tomato. I also have an additional two, marble sized, yellow tomatoes ripening. I have not even seen any flowers on the two red tomato plants. The red tomato plants grow, but no tomato production.<br /><br />I am running out of plant nutrients. I checked AeroGrows site, and they want a ridiculous price for an additional package of plant nutrients. Corporate greed at its worse.<br /><br />I have read all of the reviews, and I see that about one-third of the Cherry tomato reviews are positive. That leaves two-thirds of Cherry Tomato reviews as negative. Adding my negative Cherry Tomato review drops the positive Cherry tomato reviews to 30% positive, 70% negative.<br /><br />Given that we are all growing these things under pretty well controlled conditions, I suggest that the Cherry tomato seed kits might have a limited shelf life, and AeroGrow could be selling their old kits.<br /><br />My negative review of AeroGrow's cherry Tomato seed kit on their site was NOT PUBLISHED. So I published my review on Amazon.<br /><br />With respect to the AeroGrow garden, in my opinion, the location of the pump is flawed. It should not be located at the bottom of the tank because that is where the roots want to go. The pump should be located higher up on the tank, and it should be located in a position where it can be easily maintained, without damaging your crops. I hope someone else comes out with a competitive product. Frankly, I don't like the way AeroGrow does business.",Looks like 70% of Cherry Tomato Reviews are NEGATIVE,1

Something nobody in their right mind would eat and call ""fruit"".<br /><br />This is not fruit -- it's candy.  And as candy -- it's not even good candy.  Why not go for a piece of real fruit followed by a bit of REAL 60-75% chocolate made with REAL sugar.  Chocolate has the highest concentration of anti-oxidents on the planet -- so many that it has a naturally ultra-long shelf life with no zero- none- nada- not-a-bit of preservative or partially hydrogenated anything.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I've just about reached the end of my patience with these monolithic companies that market empty calories laced with poison under innocent sounding names and cute, brightly colored boxes with cartoon animals on them.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by anything that says ""Zero Grams of Trans Fat"" --if it has partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients list -- then they're splitting hairs with the labeling laws.  Partially hydrogenated oil IS Trans Fat.<br /><br />If they make the portion size small enough that 1 portion has less than .5 grams of partially hydrogenated fat (even if the portion size is only 4 grams of the food)  -- then they are within the law to lie to you and advertise their product as having 0-grams of trans fat!  Can you believe it?  Whatever happened to the spirit of the law?<br /><br />Money happened.<br /><br />If a portion size is 4-grams, and each 4-grams of a 180-gram box contains .4-grams of partially hydrogenated fat -- that means the box could contain as much as 18-grams of TRANS FAT.  It's a con.  It's a lie.  It's trying to pass a lie that falls within the letter of the law off as the truth.  I've actually read boxes where the serving size was 2 crackers -- little tiny crackers -- that together weighed less than 9 grams.  That's less than 1/3 of an ounce.  Who is that supposed to be a serving for?

"Agree with some of the negative reviewers in that it tastes a lot like the packaged, instant hot cocoa mixes.  I use Cadbury's or even Safeway brand cocoa mix and boil the milk and all that - but as I do have a Keurig machine (actually Cuisinart now - Keurig brand did not last a year!) wanted to try this since it's at my grocery store.<br />It's very sweet.  It seems to be creamier than the packet versions (no lumps of powder) but it is definitely sweet - and as much as I like sweet this was just too much.  Maybe as other reviewers have stated it is because it is made with a sweetener rather than sugar.<br />So - no I wouldn't recommend this at all if you expect 'chocolaty' because you do get a 'sugary/strange sweetener' taste.",very sweet - too sweet even,1
"I need a repellent to keep the ants from climbing the pole outside on my deck where my hummingbird feeder hangs full of sugar water.  I bought the HOT SHOT because it had a similar delivery system to COMBAT that I liked and previously used.  The opening on the HOT SHOT syringe is 1/4"", on the COMBAT about 1/8"".  The HOT SHOT syringe didn't work smoothly consequently I got big globs and blobs of gel, frequently in places I didn't want it, because the syringe kept sticking. I would  have to replace the HOT SHOT two more times to get through the summer ant problem  whereas with the COMBAT I was better able to target a specific area with a smooth delivery  without excess in unwanted places.  One purchase of the COMBAT lasted the whole summer.  The COMBAT has a tight fitting cap for the end of the syringe so there is no oozing or drying of the product.  I found the COMBAT and will continue using it.",Poor Delivery System,1

"14 out of 24 cans arrived dented, due to inadequate packaging (boxes were shrink wrapped to a cardboard tray and then thrown in a shipping box with a small amount of butcher paper).  Dense material like canned goods should be surrounded with packing peanuts in order to arrive undamaged.  Needless to say, I will not order canned goods again through Amazon.<br /><br />This is not the end of the story.  Amazon's standard policy on damaged food is 10%, or 20% maximum discount.  In this case, 58.3% of the food  arrived damaged--and no way was I going to pay for what I won't use.  After 1/2 hour on the phone, the customer service manager granted me an ""exception"" and allowed a refund of 58.3% of my purchase price.  But I should not have had to waste so much of my time insisting on it.<br /><br />That said, Harmony Farms dog food itself is a great product.  The reason I'm willing to pay almost $2 per can is that it's made in the USA (no danger of melamine, etc.).  So there you have it.

"Purchased approximately 24 of these bars in different flavors (the chocolate fudge being my personal favorite, though the brownie crunch is also tasty).  The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56"">Quest Bar 2.12 oz.

"I ordered this on 7/30/12. It came on 8/25/12 (not super fast, but not unreasonable coming from India). I wanted to be excited to get this product, but was initially worried about my cardamom because the small cardboard box was very warped and appeared as though it had gotten quite wet at some point. I hoped that the product inside had been packaged in a way that allowed it to remain dry. Boy was I disappointed (I've bought on amazon for years, and this is my very first review. Yep, I'm that unhappy). I cut the tape and looked inside. All of the pods were loose inside the box! They were not contained in any protective covering whatsoever. I removed the pods from the box and did locate a split plastic ziploc bag. Nothing else. It appeared as though it had no hope of keeping my product safe through the shipping process, and not just because of the split in the bag. Nope. It also was completely unsealed. I took pictures but there is no way for me to attach them to this review. The cardamom smelled musty, and I had to throw it away. I was very disappointed. I know accidents can happen, but placing my cardamom into a low quality plastic bag, failing to seal it, and tossing it into a cardboard box just doesn't cut it.

"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>",All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!,1

I want a shirt that says ""I waited 45 minutes to complete the Cereal City scavanger hunt and all I got was this crappy sippy cup.""<br /><br />Sadly there is much, much more...I could go on at length.

"There is something off tasting about my grandma's coffee cake. i've had it twice now and the last time with my own grandma believe it or not. She agreed with me about the taste. Her favorite coffee cake is Fantasicakes coffee cake or Boston coffee cake (you can get both on amazon). I agree totally. I had never heard of Fantasicakes until my grandma mentioned it months ago. So I looked them up on Amazon and ordered me a cinnamon walnut coffee cake from Fantasicakes...one word: AMAZING. One of my motivations of ordering it over Boston Coffee Cake is i noticed pound for pound they're cheaper. I'm glad I did. Either one is better then My Grandma's coffee cake honestly. If you think this is good, i recommend trying Fantasicakes or Boston coffee cake. And another thing about My Grandma's coffee cake is it doesn't have enough walnuts in the middle. FYI I ordered My grandma's coffee cake from QVC and one time i saw it at my local Gelson's and thought i'd give it one more try, but had the same result, an off taste i can't put my finger on.

"I belong to  a part of India where coconut is part of our staple diet. After moving to the US I had almost given up on the thought of drinking coconut water everyday. Prohibitive costs and availability being the primary reasons. When I saw this deal, i was really happy and ordered it immediately. The first packet came in July, my concierge who collected the packet called me immediately stating there was a leak in the box that had arrived.<br />To my relief only one of the packs had a small leak. The packs were good sized and i knew  instantly that i had a months supply of coconut water.<br />When i chilled it and tasted it, I had mixed views, while it had  distinctive sweet flavor, there was certainly an aftertaste probably coz of the packing. Anyway i developed a taste for it and it was a good month. The shipping of the second package was announced late july. I was later notified that the package had been damaged during shipping. I was refunded my money and no package was sent for the month of august.<br />I received an intimation about the packet for September arriving in late august. Again, it was the same story replayed. My concierge called me to tell me the packet is leaking. I rush down to see this time not 1 but 3 packs are damaged. I decide to return the pack, and i get notified by amazon that i cannot return the product.<br />Well i have cancelled the subscription and now a happy amazon prime customer is dejected with their level of service.",Dont even think about it,1

The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]",Made in China treats still KILLING dogs - ABC NEWS 2012!,1
"This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is ""russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA"".  Notice that this product title starts with ""Alaskan Salmon"", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of ""Grained Salmon Caviar""  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see ""made in USA"" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was ""sorry I was out of town"".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.

"I consider myself a big fan of both Reese's and Whoppers so I was excited when I saw this new product.  However, after going through one box over a few days, I find this to be a major disappointment.  The product is very waxy and doesn't have enough peanut butter taste (package says ""Peanut Butter Flavored"" which should have been a red flag to begin with).  Maybe this product could be improved if the company 1) adds real peanut butter and 2) tries a double-layer coating of chocolate and peanut butter since this is the winning combination for the famous Reese's peanut butter cups.",Very Disappointing - Room For Improvement?,1
"I really tried this with an open mind. I love hot tea in the afternoon as well as other 'soothing' drinks. But this one was a killer. It comes as a powder to mix with hot water. It doesn't say how much water on the packet so I assumed that one packet is for one cup of water (as per the directions on this site).<br /><br />One sip put me into the gag zone. I'm sorry to say that it was horrible. It was bitter, spicy, too strong, and way over the top. I like ginger but in small doses. This was like chewing on a piece of ginger root. I guess there are some people that like that but for me, it was not a good experience. I tried additional sips just to be sure but it was a killer taste each time. And, it's hard to get the strong ginger taste out of your mouth.<br /><br />I know this is a personal choice but my choice is to stay away.<br /><br />*****Added note*****<br />My husband tried it and liked it.

I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be.

"This was a horrifying experience. I was really excited to see the noodles advertised on one of my favorite ""deal"" sites, and when the cost of noodles averaged out to about a dollar per package, including shipping, I decided to purchase them. I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.<br /><br />First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. Seriously, Google ""Doctor Cyberman innards"" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.<br /><br />You can't even call them noodles.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are.",No. Just no.,1

"I used this product for 10 days.  Loved the scent, at first my scalp did feel clean and healthy.  By the end of the first week my hair began to change.  It seemed I could see scalp through my hair in full sunlight (noticed in the rearview mirror in the car).  I had noticed my hair was becoming fly away, which generally only happens in the dead of winter, never in the summer.<br /><br />After day 10 it was obvious something was very wrong.  My hair stands from root to tip were much thinner, half thier  normal volume.  My healthy hair was now baby fine!  It was clear that the cause was topical since the effect was every piece of hair, the entire length of each strand.  I had  not changed or added any other product, process, or activity in my routine other than using this shampoo.  I did not use the companion conditioner, I stuck with my usual conditioning product during this trial.<br /><br />This product stripped away the cuticle and actually reduced the thickness of my hair.  I did not actually lose hair (no bald patches, no extra in the brush, no breakage).  Just seemed to eat away at the hairs but left them intact.  This was not a welcome effect as I have light, fine hair to begin with.  There is no way to reduce the damage, other than discontinue use and let the hair grow out naturally.  This will take time since my hair falls at the middle of my back.  Yes, others have noticed the loss of volume and how thin my hair looks.<br /><br />Doing a sink test with the remainder of the bottle - washing a test clipping of my daughter's thick, coarse hair with it daily for a week to watch it break down the hair.

"I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. ""They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.""  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  ""At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,""<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary.",These scare me.

"I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats. His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product.

"Why put unsweetened ingredients in one of these bars? Unsweetened chocolate? Disgusting. This product lacks flavor and is way too heavy and dense. I also don't know what could be nastier than unsweetened coconut. It needs to be lighter in texture and a lot sweeter (not cloyingly so) and then this might be at least tasty. As it is, it is a waste of money and an absolute disappointment.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: look for inspiration in the flourless chocolate cake sold at Trader Joe specifically for gluten free diets, and check out the flavorful almond horn by Aleia. Both are mildly sweet, but full of flavor.  The chocolate flavor pops in the mouth and makes you forget that it has no gluten in it.  The almond horn delights you with the fragrance before it ever hits your mouth.  Both go great with tea, coffee and fruit, particularly the cake goes well with fresh stawberries.<br /><br />Maybe you just need to stick to a core ingredient and work around it.  There is too much nastiness going on in this disgusting bar.<br /><br />This is a terrible product that cannot be recommended. There are just way too many nasty gluten free products on the market, and this should be placed exactly where I just put it, in the garbage. More $$ down the drain and continued disappointment reigns.<br /><br />I am being brutally honest because I was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy and have exceedingly fond memories of all of the delicious wheat-based offerings I used to eat and I naturally expect to be able to partake delicious gluten-free substitutes, espcially since they usually cost twice as much as the products containing gluten.

The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).

"I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required.

The list goes on of junk food for dogs with some artificial flavors and coloring added in also.  They are counting on pretty packaging with healthy claims distracting people from the actual ingredient list that contradicts those claims.  The feeding instructions say that you should feed your dog 1 cup for each 10 pounds of body weight, which means my 70 pound Lab would go through 7 cups of this junk food a day and at 22 cups of it a bag, would last her 3 days.

"I love coffee, and have a terrible addiction to Starbucks! So, when I was in the coffee aisle looking for a nice flavor to try I saw the Starbucks Caramel Natural Fusions. I was so excited to set up my coffee maker so that all I had to do was hit the switch in the morning! There is nothing I love more than the smell of fresh coffee when a new package is opened but when I opened up this coffee I almost gagged. The smell was overwhelming, sort of like burnt dirt. It was extremely dark in color too, almost like soil. I still have yet to hit the brew button on the coffee maker tomorrow morn, but I figure I would give it a fair shot. After reading some of the reviews here tonight, I am already expecting to be tossing it down the drain.","Horrible odor, Smells like no coffee I ever enjoyed.",1

"If you are looking for oatmeal cookies do not buy these as they have the same texture and flavor as Keebler's other cookies. I purchased these in hopes of having delicious oatmeal texture and flavor however what I received by what I could see was a standard keebler cookie with oats on top. Now I know some of you might be thinking, if you find their other cookies appetizing why did you rate it one star? Simply because when I purchase an oatmeal cookie, I expect an oatmeal cookie where the oats are a dominant flavor in the palate. I paid for an oatmeal cookie and I received a repackaged re-branded keebler cookie. The second major reason behind my rating is the packaging is absolutely worthless, if you must buy these purchase a ziplock bag to keep the cookies from going stale or eat them in one sitting.",Tastes just like any of their other cookies,1

Our son enjoyed this cereal as a snack and until recently, as a cereal, but then I bought my most recent box and noticed right away they didn't look the same.  When I tasted one I immediately knew they were sweetened and sure enough, when I checked the nutrition label it showed 3g of sugar per serving.  The label is completely unchanged except for the ingredients and this is dangerously misleading.  We live in a country where diabetes is rampant and sugar can be very dangerous.  How frightening that they Cascadian Farms/General Mills would sneak sugar into their cereal without changing any of the main labelling.

"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?",Gerber's fruits are cooked,1
The chips are so-so.  For me a package when opened must pass the smell test - these didn't.  When ordering a case (12 bags) I assumed they would be shipped in a factory packed box.  Not so.  They were repackaged by Amazon in a box designed for ten bags.  The case consisted of 12 bags.  No problem for the packer as he just squeezed in the two extra bags.

Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews first which others clearly complain about as well. I bought 3 boxes and had to give them away to friends, family and coworkers before they expired. So I am out $75 and had scramble at the last minute and bought slim jims at smart and final, which is what i was told soldiers hate, but it was our only option. It seems Amazon makes no effort to make sure their sellers are showing real items and makes me rethink renewing my prime account for another year.",NOT INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED - EXTREMELY disappointed with the seller and AMAZON!!!,1
"I'd give this negative stars if I could. After steeping according to directions I ended up with a pot of tea that had a very bitter, chemical taste, so i threw that batch out. I tried again, steeping it as you would a green tea, 175 degrees less than 1 minute. This was drinkable, but not good. The taste was very astringent, somewhat bitter. I actually got a sore throat from drinking it. I then tried blending small amounts of it with other teas. I tried 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp gyokuro, the green was completely overpowered by the white. Threw that batch out as well. Then I tried blending 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp monkey picked oolong. The result was okay, but then I went to the bathroom. My urine smelled like burnt plastic!?!?!?!? It was so bad that I actually searched the house to find the source of the chemical fire. It was the next time I went that I realized where the odor was coming from. I've never experienced anything like that before. Bottom line, I probably won't be purchasing ANY teavana products again.",Its like drinking battery acid,1

"When I think of Chicken Pot Pie I drool over the chicken and vegetables and pie crust along with the delicious gravy.  Now take all that away and add FAT noodles instead.  That is what is in this terrible soup.....just fat noodles.  It does have a nice flavor but I soon realized that, after not having a migraine in over a year, it was this soup that caused me to have a migraine for two days.  The large amount of 'yeast extract', in other words MSG, that is in it caused my migraine.  How can an ORGANIC soup have such an artificial chemical neurotoxin in it and still be considered organic?  I will donate the remaining cans to the food pantry and hope they like 'noodles' and MSG.  I will never purchase this soup nor this brand again but be my guest and give it a try.

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",Kitty Junk Food,1

"I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey cereal.  The taste is redolent of corn puffs, with a hint of Multi-grain Cheerios.  Too much honey on the front end, with corn notes that are slightly overpowering in the finish.  The bouquet has distinct peanut notes which is unsurprising as peanuts (which actually aren't a nut) are the main nut in the cereal.  Somehow this combines however, into a cereal that is at once both, overly sweet and mealy.<br /><br />I would also add that the price, $30 + $8 shipping comes out to about .88 an ounce.  Compare that to major grocery chains and other cereals, such as Crunchy Nut Roasted O's at .38/oz, or Honey nut cheerios at .28/oz, and its clear that these are horribly overpriced.<br /><br />Also, when it says nuts (and I realize I'm being a stickler), I really expect it to contain treenuts, like almonds, cashews, etc.  Peanuts are a legume, a groundnut, and technically a bean.  Not a nut.","Not great, Horribly overpriced",1

"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.","Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie",2

"I'm not sure most American coffee drinkers would go for this. I tried it several times at varying strengths, and even using half what I normally use, it tasted way too strong and burnt. It has very little complexity--whatever is there is drowned in the harsh burnt taste that reminds me of mud for some reason. I don't have an issue with regular coffee though I did once have trouble with acid reflux; I didn't notice much difference in acidity levels and the sheer overwhelming strength of the coffee gave me a stomachache that normal coffee doesn't.<br /><br />I understand that some foreign drinkers might like this and suspect that's the market the manufacturer is going for.

"As other reviewers have noted, the product arrived damaged... over half the cans were dented and 3 of them badly enough to compromise the seal (lovely smell). The problem is that a dent near the top of the can causes the lid to separate along the score-line that would normally only separate when you pull the pull-top lid off. It is clear that this happened before the product reached Amazon for shipment as the light bulbs shipped in the same box suffered no ill effects (not to mention the age of the stain on the cans themselves).<br /><br />The product itself seems to be OK; it looks pretty much like the pictured product, though not all of our cats enjoyed it and it has a strong fragrance of fish even when sealed properly - was a hit with one of the cats, not so much the others. For a product at this price point, and at the relative rate of damage noted in other reviews, this is not something I will buy again as I am now concerned that I may have missed a slightly damaged seal and would not want to risk feeding my (spoiled) animals a spoiled product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer is reading this, my first thoughts would be jams at case conveyor transitions, low back-pressure conveyor failure, palletizer/wrapper problems or rough forklift handling.

"When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture).  I looked at the label - it says: ""feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight"".  So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight.  Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended.  But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal.  So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal.  The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15).  In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day.  So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet).  That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand.  I think this product is overpriced and cat owners need to be aware of the calorie content in Weruva's canned cat food, so that they won't underfeed their pets with insufficient amount of calorie.",Healthy but extremely low calorie per can (be careful not to underfeed your cat),2

"This is the latest foray into the ""all natural"" nutritional drinks market. Despite boasting ""real fruit juice"" on the packaging, the flavor is simply too watered down to notice. Having drank plenty of coconut water, this drink has barely more than a hint of it. Most likely, it clashes with the taste of the guava, which is also hardly noticeable. In fact, were it not for the label on the packaging, this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be. Speaking of the which, the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids, sans the accompanying straw. Also, this 8.5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost. Given the price for a pack of 12, it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck. The nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks, however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market. Overall, O.N.E. has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks.

Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out. it seems to be little square bite size (for cats) pieces of a chicken-like item, in a broth, mostly broth. Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the ""soup"" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it).

The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.

That leaves the yellow, pink, orange (usually) and blue ones as safe to eat. These aren't supposed to be hard candy, are they?<br /><br />The Necco web site says these hearts are produced all year for sale during the Valentines holiday period. They are supposed to be soft candy. So it seems that you may get a bag from eleven months ago or a couple weeks ago. Good luck! I think I got the from spring 2011.<br /><br />By the way, I got my 7 oz bags for only a fraction of the coin demanded here, so best to look at the grocery store in the seasonal items area first.<br /><br />Also, I bought a bag of the Brach's Conversation Hearts and did a comparison. The Brach's product seemed fresh with no rock hard hearts, but the flaver is a bit more bland. It's difficult to tell if the different color Brach's hearts are meant to be different flavors. They're more like just fresh sweet chalk.","Hard hearted candy manufactured all year, sold now.",2

"Newtons Fruit Thins (Fig and Honey) / B004FELBH8<br /><br />I was really excited about receiving these cookies through Amazon Vine - I'm a big fan of the Newtons ""fig newtons"" line of products and always have been. It seemed like a transition to ""cookie"" would be inevitably good, but... these cookies just didn't do it for me or my family.<br /><br />I guess I should have been concerned when my husband bit into one of these and said, ""These taste like sand!"" I didn't feel like they were quite *that* bad, but it's true that these are *very* dry and somewhat crumbly. They remind me a little bit of dry graham crackers or dry ""nilla wafers"" - I ended up dunking these cookies in milk to make them a little more palatable.<br /><br />The dried fruit bits in these cookies are nice, but not anything to really write home about. The fig and honey flavoring is very subtle and seems to come across more in the scent than in the actual taste.<br /><br />Overall, I like the sweetness balance of these cookies - they're not overpowering, and the flavor is nice - but the intense dryness of the cookie combined with the sticky chewiness of the dried fruit was just too toothsome for me. If the cookie had been softer, I would have liked these a lot more - as it was, I felt like I was eating very dry crackers and I didn't enjoy the experience.<br /><br />I don't like to waste things, so I'll try to finish the entire bag, but the rest of the family has already informed me that I'm on my own.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll",If you really like graham crackers...?,2

"I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!)

As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""

"I bought this ""flavor"" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3.

When it was time to reorder Rolands I found reviews stated that quality had changed, so I thought I'd return to a brand I trusted.  It seems the quality of many have changed recently, not sure why.<br /><br />In this specific batch, the milk was a bit more watery and oily.  I just use a portion of the can daily in smoothies, so when I refrigerate the remaining milk, the distinct oil separates and forms a hard layer on top.

"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.

"My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to ""spin"" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't ""Paw-centric"" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product.

"The box proclaims ""Sweetened with Honey"", and honey granules are listed as the first ingredient, so I thought, finally, something that is just lightly sweetened.  Uh, no, once I tasted it I double checked the fine print ingredients and saw that there is Sucralose in it.  While honey granules might be the largest ingredient by volume, by taste, it is overwhelmed by the artificial sweetener.  When a maker is so deceptive in the presentation of the product, it makes me wonder what else is misleading in it.<br /><br />I tried diluting it, in order to reduce the sweetness.  Well, the berry flavor receded into the background, but it was still too sweet.  Too bad.....<br /><br />It tastes like punch, and the convenience factor is great.  I love the way there are so many of these little single serve water flavors available now, but the artificially sweetened ones are way too sweet, as is this one.

Illy happens to be one of my favorite brands for making lattes and cappuccinos, so I felt pretty confident that this drink would be good.  I was half right.  This may be one of the oddest things I've drunk yet.<br /><br />At the first sip, it tasted like lightly sweetened, fairly strong espresso, but there was something off.  I took another sip, trying to figure out what it was, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.<br /><br />I decided to try pouring it into a glass to see if this alleviated the strangeness.  I took another sip and, yep, still strange.  It took me a while to realize that the strangeness was that it seemed almost like it was carbonated, yet it didn't fizz.  This made no sense to me, so I checked the label to find that potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate are two of the ingredients.  Bingo.  My guess is these ingredients are conspiring to give this coffee a strange, difficult to describe aftertaste.<br /><br />Ultimately, this ruined the beverage for me.

"Clearly this new Purina line of pet food cleverly capitalizes on recent human food trends such as chef-made dinners.  The stylized food-porn photography on the packaging all target the pet owner that wants to feed the pet version of their own heat-and-eat chef-prepared meals.<br /><br />The advert:<br />Purina's Chef Michael's TV adverts suggest that ""Chef Michael"" is celebrity chef Michael Chiarello. However, non of the shots actually show the face of the man in the commercial although he is of similar height, build and complexion as chef Chiarello and is dressed in clothes of a style and color that Chiarello usually wears on his shows.  After some internet research, and an email to Purina, it can be concluded that chef Chiarello has nothing to do with this food. Wow! Just wow! How tricky of Purina to make a fake chef that is almost like a real celebrity chef and market their product with it.<br /><br />The Food<br />Pros:<br />+ My dog was immediately attracted to the bag when it was delivered.<br />+ My dog was really into this kibble and I managed to use it as treats for training.<br />+ It looks really nice to humans, with coloured bits making it look like it was some sort of dried pet gourmet-stew.<br />+ The first ingredient on the list is beef.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Questionable ingredient quality.<br />- The second ingredient on the list is soybean meal and the third and fourth are soy flour and animal fat.  The soybean meal and soy flour are fillers that also increase the chemical protein measurement of the food.  The fourth ingredient of animal fat from unspecified sources increases the platablity of the food to pets.<br />- Other questionable ingredients include corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn which is again a filler and is also not easily digested by dogs.<br />- Food coloring is also present in this food to make it looks appealing to us so we feel better about feeding this food to our pets.<br />- Mendaione (chemical vitamin K) is also added to the food; studies are currently being done on this chemical form of vitamin K and latest results suggest that it may be linked to liver toxicity, allergies and red blood cell abnormalities.<br /><br />My dog (after 2 weeks on this food):<br />+ My picky dog is inexplicably attracted to this food.<br />+ I can use this kibble as training treats.<br />- This food makes her have gas.<br />- This food makes her have several large greasy poops a day.<br />- My dog has been gagging in the morning and has thrown up undigested food a few times over the past 2 weeks.

When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.

It is probably made from the stems and leaves that are a discarded by-product of broccoli florets.  I am a big fan of Velveeta but I don't think the cheese sauce on this product lived up to their name.  Furthermore if a box says ""Chicken Dinner Kit"" shouldn't the chicken be included???  They should call it Chicken Helper if you're going to have to add your own chicken.  There are other boxed pasta and chicken dinners that come with a can of chicken.  In my opinion, if you're going to have a convenience food, it ought to be all-inclusive.  I actually used some Costco canned chicken in mine and it was by far the best tasting thing on the plate.  Also the nutrition information is based on there being 5 servings per box.  Perhaps if you are a bird!  I'd say 2-3 is closer to the truth if this is being served as your entree.  So in reality, your portion might be as much as 975 calories with 250 of those being fat.  If you're going to eat something that unhealthy it ought to taste a lot better than this stuff.

At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box.

"When I first found that fresh garlic was available on Amazon, I was stoked.  We go through LOTS of garlic at home, to the point where we'd be buying at least six large heads of garlic every week.  Super, I thought, three pounds of garlic delivered so I'll be stocked all the time!  The price for the size of the bag was very good, I thought.<br /><br />When I received the garlic, however, I was very disappointed in the quality.  I began using the garlic the very night I received it, so it was not sitting in my pantry for months.  Here is what I found:  Fully half the bag was either rotten, shriveled, or sprouting.  This is indicative of garlic that has been sitting around for some time and/or improperly stored.  When stored properly, fresh garlic remains fresh, firm, and crisp for weeks... or months.  Many of the heads in the bag were completely rotten all the way through.  Some were just light for their size and the cloves were wrinkled and shriveled.  An equal number were in an advanced stage of sprouting.  Those that were suitable for use were OK, but only just that.  These were not fresh heads of garlic.<br /><br />Very disappointed, I contacted Casa de Fruta via email.  After my second message, they were kind enough to ship a brand new bag immediately.  To their credit, the new bag of garlic arrived very quickly.  It was definitely better than the first, but I still lost about 10 heads of garlic to rot and shriveling; that's still a lot in a 3 pound bag, and what would have been a great deal for a full bag of fresh, crisp garlic turned out to be just a real disappointment and a bad deal for a bag of average-to-poor-to-unusable garlic.  For reference, I went through the entire second bag in less than a month, and it was stored in a cool, dry environment.  It was stored properly, in other words.<br /><br />So, at this point I don't know what to think.  I based my original purchase on the few - and all excellent - reviews and, indeed, I would have rated the garlic at 4 stars + had the second bag contained what I was expecting from the reviews.  That was not my experience, however.  It is possible, I suppose, that I was just twice unlucky.  Still, you'd think that the company would have made certain that the second bag sent, DUE to a customer complaint of quality no less, would have been totally primo.  I've got to go with the odds on this one then, and take my garlic business elsewhere.<br /><br />One final note:  Had it not been for courteous and timely response from the vendor, I would have rated this product at one star rather than two based on the quality.",Disappointing,2

"I have purchased many Premier brand products and liked them, especially the Busy Buddy dog toys.  However, the Tug-a-jug is not one of them.  The treats do not dispense as easily as some of their other products so some dogs may get discouraged.  My dog stopped playing with it due to that.  The  tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass.  If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by.  It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges.

"TLDR version:  Look elsewhere if you want great decaf beans.  These weren't even worth the price at 57% off list.<br /><br />Normal version:<br /><br />I purchased these when there was a deal a few weeks ago, and have been brewing both espresso and drip coffee with them and a caffeinated variety by the same company.  This review is for the Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Decaf Espresso.<br /><br />The first thing to say about Larry's Beans is that they are all packaged quite well in individual boxes which contain the air-tight bag of beans.  This makes them easy to stack in a warehouse, and also prevents warehouse employees from inadvertently slicing open the bag when unloading a crate or larger package.<br /><br />When I received the beans, I immediately fished out some freezer bags and prepared to portion out the beans.  I opened the sealed bag and the beans smelled OK; the smell wasn't overpowering but it was not what I would consider ""gourmet.""  It's not old or musty smelling like some of the other ""gourmet"" decaf bean roasters represented here on Amazon, but it's also not top shelf.<br /><br />Although the beans are evenly roasted, I would definitely not call it Espresso roast.  The roast is more reminiscent of a mild breakfast roast - medium brown, not the dark black I expect when I think of espresso.  Also, the beans are very small - clearly not a premium batch of beans.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to accurately represent the style of roast, and for the beans to be large, although uniform in size.  Neither were the case with these beans.<br /><br />When portioning the beans into 1lb freezer bags, I found that the beans really aren't oily at all.  I surmise that this has to be due to the water process used to decaffeinate the beans, although I don't know this to be a fact.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to be oily enough to leave a clear film on the inside of the freezer bags I package them in, and this didn't accomplish that feat.<br /><br />As you can see, the initial impressions of the look and smell of the beans were only mediocre, not outstanding like the price should suggest.  Now, on to the flavor.<br /><br />Fresh out of the 5lb bag, I hand-ground enough of the beans for a couple of shots of espresso.  Yes, I have a counter-mounted hand grinder that can also be used to make flour from grains!  Anyway, I ran the ground coffee through my pump espresso maker, and what came out the other side had no crema, although the shots themselves didn't taste horrible.  The flavor was reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, with astringent, grapeskin-like qualities that struck me as quite bitter for the mild roast.<br /><br />I have since made pots of drip decaf with this bean, and combined it with a caffeinated version from Larry's Beans, and it's passable (carried by the excellent quality of the caffeinated beans, I'm sure), although still not what I would consider worth the price.  I haven't found any excellent decaf beans on Amazon, yet, so I will move on to another variety once this batch is gone.",Hard to find excellent decaf beans on Amazon.,2

"Since my family loves Spam (fried for sandwiches) I thought I would try this product for a change of pace. Not sure, really, what I expected but was not sold on this at all. Did not have the taste of regular Spam but did not have the taste of roasted turkey either. Not sure what it tasted like. I proceeded to prepare it as I always do for sandwiches....heated up a non-stick skillet and sliced the product. Now I realize that this product is leaner than the regular Spam, and having said that I know now that I should have sprayed the skillet with a non-stick spray such as Pam. The product stuck to the pan like crazy and I was not able to fry it up evenly. This gave the procuct a mushy texture that was not pleasing.

"I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

"These are actual slices of tuna that can be either a treat or a meal for your cat or dog. As others have mentioned, I too had trouble getting the package open. You are supposed to tear off the top and then open a resealable zip closure. But by the time I got to the tuna, the zip was ruined, so it became a meal for my cats. The tuna was easy to handle and broke up into smaller bite-sized bit without any effort. It also was not as ""fishy"" in smell as you might expect.<br /><br />Did my cats like it? Of Yeah! But the problem is price. $9.99 for a 4 ounce package? You can get 12 Chicken of the Sea 2.5 ounce tuna packages here on Amazon.com for $15.54 and this is tuna you can eat too!<br /><br />If it had a better price point and was easier to open, I would give it a better score. But at this price, you are better off buying tuna from the grocery section of the store.",Good but expensive,2
"Fresh ginger is spicy and hot. Clean your sinuses out hot. In all my years of consuming grated ginger, powdered ginger, ginger ale, ginger beer, candied ginger and a favorite when I have a writing project due, chocolate dipped ginger... none of it has ever tasted bitter. Just hot and spicy. A tiny bit citrusy. But clean and mouth tingling.<br /><br />Not this. It is a powder in a foil packet. I boiled fresh filtered water in a clean kettle and poured it into a clean mug. I could taste the ginger and the lemon flavor... then a very bitter aftertaste. Old, gone around the bend, wheat paste flavor. If I was sick with a very bad cold it would serve the purpose to clean my head out... but if you have access to a fridge at all - get a jar of grated ginger and a bottle of lemon juice and mix your own. A teaspoon of honey, teaspoon bottled grated ginger and teaspoon lemon juice with 8 oz. boiling water and you'll feel just like new. Or pour boiling water over a few slices of fresh ginger and a fresh-squeezed lemon wedge and let it seep 5 minutes -- but I have trouble with fresh lemons shriveling in the crisper drawer before I use them.<br /><br />This powder would be good to put in your carry-on luggage to clear your head on a long trip. But I think I actually prefer ... trade secret here ... lemon-flavored Gatorade made with hot water. I think will actually prevent a cold if you drink two cups the minute your throat gets itchy.<br /><br />Oh! Ginger is also good for digestion. Again - I'd prefer a spoon of fresh grated in a tub of yogurt to this powder - but this powder would help if you were traveling.<br /><br />Good luck! May you never need to know what hot Gatorade tastes like!",Bitter aftertaste - but ok for emergencies when traveling!,2

"I dislike writing bad reviews, I'm one of those people that believes that if you don't have something nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all.  BUT, I am a tea reviewer and above all, it is important for me to tell it like it is, and sometimes that requires me to say something is bad when it is.<br /><br />And unfortunately, this Peach Matcha just doesn't hold up to the other Matcha teas that I've tried.  I've tried quite a few of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha (as you can tell by looking at the number of reviews that I've posted), and there have only been two that I've not enjoyed - this one and the apricot.<br /><br />Prepared traditionally using hot water and whisking, this is has a strong chemical taste that is really off-putting.  However ... and this Matcha's one redeeming quality which is why I gave it two stars instead of one ... if you make it as a latte, it ends up tasting much better.  The chemical taste is nearly gone (there are still traces of this taste, but it is very faint) and I can taste the peach and the matcha.  These flavors are also muted a bit because of the milk, but, it makes a nice, tasty matcha latte that tastes of matcha and peach.<br /><br />However, even though the latte was far better than the traditionally prepared Matcha ... I can't give it a higher rating because of that chemical taste.  I do hope that Red Leaf Tea considers finding a better flavoring for the peach and the apricot.  I had high hopes for them.","Unfortunately, this one didn't work for me...",2

"I just returned from Singapore and tried a really wonderful ginger tea.  I brought home two giant bags, I was so impressed, so when I saw this product, I gave it a try.  I can honestly say that there is simply no comparison.  Since I only received a packet as a sample, there were no directions on how much to use, but I had assumed it was one packet to a cup of water.  When I gave it a try, I thought it was going to burn a hole in my throat.  Although apparently mixed with honey and lemon, it only enhances the strength of the ginger.  I ended up dumping half the cup out and filling it with more water to see if it would create a more mellow flavor, but it only decreased the flavor while leaving the burning sensation in full strength.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I don't think the lemon is doing this tea any favors.  It simply ends up tasting medicinal, so if you're using it for digestive purposes, colds, and stomach cramping like most ginger teas are alleged to help, then it's probably the way to go, but if you're looking for a good tasting ginger tea with all the health benefits, I would pass on this one.",Really really strong!,2

"When this product became a ""Helper Complete Meal"" instead of just a regular ""Complete Meal"", they reformulated the topping, which used to be a breadcrumb-based parmesan-cheese blend. The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor is very mild, not ""Alfredo"" at all, but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good. The overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese. It is, however, a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 (or maybe 2 adults + 1 child).<br /><br />What is there is indeed easy to make, and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box. If you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe, then this is OK. However, if you're looking for a high-quality meal, look elsewhere.

Thinking perhaps the catnip was past its prime, I rubbed them in some fresh to entice the cats to at least play with them.  One mouthful of the fringe was enough for each cat.  I gave the third ring to a friend who fosters kittens.  Not one of the five she has would use the ring.  I sure can't call these a good deal.",No joy with the chew ring,2

"I tried this for lunch at work once, and I regretted not bringing something else. The sauce is great, it doesn't taste like a ton of preservatives nor does it leave an aftertaste like these kinds of sauces often do. The real problem is the pasta. It tastes, to put it bluntly, like cardboard. I've had whole grain many times before, and I know it doesn't normally taste like that. I wasn't so disgusted that I couldn't eat it, but the whole time I wished I had something else.<br /><br />The serving size was an additional problem. Maybe good for a really light lunch when you're home, but no good when you've been at work and you'd like something to satisfy you.

While my one-year-old dog gobbled it up (as she does with everything, and may have swallowed it whole for all I know), my six-year-old dog was hesitant at first.  He sniffed it a bit and then had a very hard time taking that first bite into the very hard biscuit.  I think he was afraid of breaking his teeth!  (And he chews on very hard toys/bones/rawhide.)  He didn't seem too wild about the taste either, as he wasn't in any rush to finish the square after he broke into it.

I think my tongue is dead because I could not taste the buttery caramel flavoring that was supposed to be on these cakes.  There was a coating but  not enough flavor.

I held off ordering the rice cakes so they would not be shipped in the middle of winter and ordered them now so they would not be shipped during our rainy season.  I did not want stale rice cakes.  My strategy did not work.  The one cake I tried was almost stale but still edible. I put it in a toaster oven to dry it out a bit and that helped though the coating got tough.

"Yogi Tea's Pomegranate Green Tea has been my favorite tea for years and years, and when my local grocery store stopped carrying this flavor, I started ordering it from Amazon by the case.  It's a good value (cheaper here than at Whole Foods!), but as much as I love this tea, a case of it lasts a long time, and at some point in the months between when I ordered the previous case and my last order, the company sneakily changed the recipe!<br /><br />I thought the flavor was a little off, so I compared the ingredient list on the new box to the list on my last old box, and there was one difference.  Both lists included ""pomegranate flavor,"" but the ""powdered pomegranate juice"" from the old box's ingredient list (also here on Amazon's ingredient list) is missing from the new box!  (I checked the Yogi Tea website, and their info confirms the change -- there's no more actual pomegranate juice in the tea at all.)  I assume real flavoring from a real food became too expensive...  So disappointing!<br /><br />I loved this tea because it wasn't super-sweet like all the other pomegranate green teas out there.  The tartness of pomegranate showed through the added stevia, and there was just a tiny touch of peppermint tossed in to make the flavor really bright -- it was refreshing iced!

I noticed the label said NEW GREAT TASTE.....Well, I won't exactly say YUCK, but these no longer taste like Spearmint at all. I don't know what they are using as a substitute for their original Spearmint oil, but is is a VERY POOR substitute. I now have two tins of these mints to eat. They are edible, but nothing I would buy again. Such a shame ! ! !",New Altoids Spearmint,2

"The herb kit that came with my Aerogarden was superb and I enjoyed caring for my little garden. Once it was time to replace it, I purchased the cherry tomato seed kit. These also grew rapidly, but one day I noticed that they had completely fallen over...how would I stake these on an Aerogarden? And yes, the lights were as close to the plants as possible. I kind of leaned them against each other to keep them upright. But they still fell over several times. So they grew and grew but I never got any tomatoes. :( I also did follow the directions to ensure that they had complete darkness for proper flowering. Fortunately we have several tomato and cherry tomato plants in our outdoor vegetable garden.

If you order directly from the manufacturers web site, you will probably pay twenty dollars or more in shipping which is outrageous!  Now the negatives...  I was born and raised in Hawaii and the delicious shave ice there is a common treat, much like ice cream in the continental US.  Sorry, but these syrups barely taste like the ones in Hawaii.  I sampled the cherry and it tasted very much like cherry cough syrup, yuck!  But that's not what really ticked me off.  Looking at the ingredients listed on the bottle, instead of cane sugar (which Hawaii used to produce and distribute in abundance), the second main ingredient listed after water is high fructose corn syrup.  Double yuck!  I'll stick with the Davinci syrups which use cane sugar and to me and my kids, taste a lot better.

My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.","Dog was a fan, but I wasn't",2

He does like steamed green beans I cook, but not this.<br /><br />I've mixed this with other foods is the only way to get him to eat some because I know its good for him.<br /><br />Good price and value, but not worth it if your child won't eat it.",I don't like it only because Son won't eat it.,2
"I love Smores, the combination of chocolate, marshmallows and graham crackers are outstanding. I also love Emerald nuts, so when I saw this at my local grocer, I had to try them.  Right away, the biggest problem with this snack is the marshmallows, if you can even call them that.  The marshmallows look like erasers from a pencil, and they are as hard as a rock.  I am not exagerrating, I nearly broke a tooth the first time I tried to bite one.  Are they stale?  Expiration date says September of 2012. I am not sure, maybe I got a bad package of these.  I am hesitant to buy another box.  The rest of the snack mix is fine, the cocoa walnuts, honey roasted peanuts, m&ms, graham chunks and oat clusters all tasted as they should.

But after a few of these treats, one of my German Shepherds started choking on it, and I had to pull it out of the back of her throat.  She wanted it back because she loves them so much, but it made me too nervous. I took them away from the other two immediately, even they were having no problem.  I wish they would come up with a chew that was safer.

"I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the ""My K cup"" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang.",Taste is obviously subjective,2

"I like Gustaf's other licorice, the ones I've posted a review on before.  But these, they are way more caramel-y than they are licorice-y.  You know the caramels (Brach's?) that you can buy in a bag and melt after you've unwrapped each piece to make caramel apples?  These are like those.  They have a grainy, very sugary texture.  Although the licorice flavor is okay, it's clear that this ""licorice"" is just caramel in disguise.  They seem way more geared to the American palate than to the European taste. (there's no ""zout"" to these at all.) These Gustaf's licorice caramels are a poor substitute for European ""caramel"" (toffee).  I won't be buying these again.<br /><br />For a better choice or replacement for the famed Callard & Browser licorice that you might remember, try Walker's NonSuch toffee.

"After our experience with other Funbites treats, I thought our dog Snowball would really enjoy these treats, but despite giving him these on different days, under different conditions, when he was hungry and when he was full, Snowball just wouldn't do more than sniff at them.<br /><br />Why?  I suspect that it must be the Peanut butter flavoring.  He's always eaten meat or vegetable flavored food and treats, and the peanut butter must be throwing him.  I may give the treats to a neighbor to see if their dog will eat them, but since these reviews are all about our experiences, I have to give this One Star - Snowball, a dog that I would think would eat ANYTHING, just won't give these a chance.<br /><br />That said, I'll have to buy another Funbites flavor for him to see if he'll like these.

"I'm a big fan of Peet's Black Currant Black Tea, which only comes in tea leaves in a tin. I use it at home all the time and I love it, but at home I can make it in a teapot and I have a personal-sized one that makes two mugs.  So I wanted black currant flavored black tea in teabag form for use at the office, where I just make one mug at a time.  (The teapot shtick is too much trouble at work and takes up too much time.)  So I found this black currant tea and figured it would be good -- it's Twining's after all -- and I went for six boxes of 20 teabags each.  Now I realize -- I probably should have paid closer attention to the illustration of the box -- that it's artificially flavored.  These teabags smell artificial compared to Peet's, and the black currant aroma of these teabags is faint compared to what I experience when I open a tin of Peet's.  When I brew a mug of tea, it has adequate flavor, but the black currant flavor is overshadowed by the artificial boysenberry-like flavoring they've added and that detracts.  I don't want my black currant flavored black tea to smell and taste of artificial boysenberry  I expect better from Twining's.  I'll stick with Peet's and I'll simply drink it at home and have another kind of tea at work.","Artificially flavored, unfortunately",2
"Bought this at a great price and Amazon did a fine job of getting it to me. I guess I wasn't a very informed consumer (my fault) because I was surprised when the ingredients on the bag had a sticker over it that just says ""100% Chicory"". So, there is absolutely NO COFFEE in it. I hate to be Mr. Precision here, but it really shouldn't be called coffee if there is none it. However, I suppose the same argument could be made for Soy ""Milk"". Anyhow, it is called Medium Dark Roast, and we were game since we did like the coffee at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans and do like dark, rich coffees. We made our first batch mixing 50% Chicory/ 50% Starbucks Bold Roast (our regular). We both could only make it through about 1.5 cups because, while smooth, it was way, WAY too sweet....like drinking Molasses. Today, we made 1/3 Chicory, 1/3 Bold Decaf Coffe, and 1/3 Bold Regular. Still way too sweet, and I have the chicory aftertaste still in my mouth.

Cereal tends to be a sweet breakfast treat, and not a staple in our home, so I can overlook the nutrition facts.<br /><br />Probably the best way I could describe Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is ""greasy Kix.""  It left a funky aftertaste and slime on my tongue.  The flavor, even before the aftertaste, wasn't good, though it was not the most horrible cereal in the world.  It was edible so I gave it an one star more than something... inedible.  My son thought it was ok, though not a favorite, but this seems to be packaged as an ""adult"" cereal so his vote doesn't count.  I was done after my first bowl and let him finish the rest over the course of two weeks.  This is unusual in my house as we usually go to blows on who gets the last bowl of cereal.

They analyzed the ingredients in Chef Michael's, concluding that it uses soybean meal, soy protein concentrate and corn gluten meal to boost the protein content, and that it likely only has a modest amount of meat.

"When I was younger, I used to eat the Maple & Brown Sugar Quaker Oatmeal all of the time- I was torn between it and Strawberries & Cream as my favorites. I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.<br /><br />First of all, it tastes different. More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken.

"Dark roast is its own league...the amino profiles of the beans change considerably.  But with that said, I've had high altitude dark roasts that were much better.  In fact, this coffee STINKS when you open the bag and sniff the beans.  I ground it coarsely and used a french press...poured in about 20 seconds...and guess what...it still doesn't smell good.  Drinking it black, it's smooth, not bitter, but flat on the palette.  I don't understand all the rave reviews...this coffee sucks.  I'd rather drink pre-ground maxwell house that's been sitting around for 30 minutes (yuck).  Maybe you can cook with it (in caramel since its not bitter, maybe) but I wouldn't bother drinking it...it sucks.  There is considerable crema and oil...but the taste is flat.

"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning.",Pros and cons...,2

"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.",Our dog's opinions,2

"I've owned cats for all of my life, and I've tried pretty much any cat treat I find in stores over the years. I'm always game to try something new, to see if my cats will enjoy it.

They come in a resealable pouch. They are fairly expensive.<br /><br />My cat loves fresh fish and eats a variety of it. However, she just was not interested in this. Maybe because it's one solid chunk of fish. I tried to break it up for her into more easily digestible chunks, but she just wasn't that interested.<br /><br />I then put the rest in the fridge to try again later. But the resealable pouch didn't do a great job, and she just wasn't interested in eating any more of it.<br /><br />I have to wonder just why this is better - if you're going to go to the expense of feeding your cat real human-grade tuna - than simply buying tuna for far less at your grocery store and feeding your cat that. It seems extreme to buy this special kitty-version of it.<br /><br />Certainly I can see that some cats would enjoy fresh tuna.

"Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.",Not for me,2

"I do not buy coffee because I need a burst of energy or alertness because caffeine does not have a significant effect upon me.  I buy coffee because I like coffee and the stronger, bolder tasting coffees appeal to me the most.  I also do not appreciate coffees that derive their stronger flavor by over burning the beans during roasting.  I like strong coffees that get their stronger taste from significantly lower water content during brewing.  All other things being equal, this high coffee to water ratio gives a fuller flavor, but at a higher cost.  If money were an issue, I would rather have fewer cups of fuller tasting coffee than many more cups of weaker, less full bodied coffee.  This Illy Italian style espresso meets none of the requirements of a good cup of coffee except that it is made from Arabica beans which tend to be less acidic, smoother and fuller bodied.  However, there are some Arabica beans that are better than others and Arabica beans are no guarantee of a good cup of coffee.<br /><br /> I would only drink this coffee under conditions of extreme thirst.  I believe this can of espresso ""tasting"" coffee compromises on so many elements of good tasting coffee such that I would not want to drink it again.  First, the espresso is weak and it probably derives whatever taste it has by over burning the beans at roasting giving it a bitter taste as opposed to a bold taste.  I know that burning the beans somewhat gives espresso its flavor by releasing more oil from the beans which allows for a frothier and smoother coffee when brewed at higher pressures.  This Illy espresso did release some additional oil, but the taste was not bold because too little coffee was used in brewing.  This does not make Italian style espresso, it makes a weak espresso with a hint of burned coffee beans that I doubt that espresso drinkers will find appealing.  Also, this espresso style coffee has a taste that cannot be described as coffee-like.  If anything it has a chemical like bitter taste that is almost sweet.  Overall, it leaves a bitter and unidentifiable taste.  Perhaps some of the metallic taste from the can has impacted the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />I do not know what this product attempts to be because of all of the compromises concerning its taste, its strength, its name, its market and its price, most of which seem to be contradictory.  I think Illy needs to go back to the drawing board to list what qualities they are trying to produce and see if that is possible in the market.  Otherwise they seem to have met none and made a product that I believe satisfies few.<br /><br />Lastly, the qualities of coffee are varied and thus a matter of personal preference.  I have noticed that those who do not really appreciate a good cup of coffee tend to classify coffee into two categories that are sufficient for them.  Those categories simply classify coffee into those that are weak or strong, modified by too weak or too strong.  I suspect that these adjectives are sufficient for a majority and tend to simplify life by not seeking the cup of coffee that is just right.  Of course, such people would use time saved on the search for truly satisfying coffee by substituting wine for coffee or colors of paint on their walls.  It seems that everyone has their specialty product of which they are aficionados.  For kids it might be cereal for blue collar workers it may be beer.  It makes one wonder if writing a review has already been done on a non-published basis for virtually all products where a choice exists.  To summarize, I don't like Illy espresso drink but I do like a fresh Guinness Draft even though I am retired.",What is this product supposed to be?,2

"Given that our dogs don't get rawhide treats often, we thought they might like to try these. However, both our 70 lb Aussie and 10 lb. Papillon rejected them. The Aussie eventually gave in and tried to bury one in the back yard, but never bothered to cover the hole. This is pretty important, because our boys will eat nearly anything! These were a nice size for small or large dogs, but neither seemed interested, despite that fact.  That said, these two dogs of ours love dehydrated cow lungs and organic carrots for snacks, so perhaps their pallates are just too refined for cardboard filled rawhide chews.",Our Picky Dogs Rejected These,2

I can drink a dipping bowl full of habanero sauce with minimal stomach irritation.. but just a small amount of Trinidad Scorpion bothers my stomach quite a bit.

Well, these bars aren't that bad, but they don't taste very good, to me anyway.

"Came packed in mylar bag that is typical of the frontier products I buy. But upon opening the bag it reeked of a very strong chemical smell that completley overpowered any of the sweet smell of nutmeg, I thought it smelled just like insecticide. Was immediately turned off.<br /><br />I went ahead and grated some up. It still smelled awful to me, so I compared it to some preground nutmeg I have in my cupboard for probably at least 8 to 10 years. The preground still smelled great, especially when compared to what I had just grated.<br /><br />So I took about 15 of the nuts and scrubbed them with scrubrush in hot soapy water, rinsed, dried, and then stored in new fresh storage container.

"I recently purchased this product and thought it strange that it showed evidence of grit/dirt (i.e. when I steeped the tea in a glass jar I noticed that after pouring out the tea grit remained on the threads of the jar).  When I opened the 2nd bag that I purchased, about 1 month later, I found a clump of dirt (approximately 1/2"" in diameter).  I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was ""If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund"".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated ""we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)"".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.  Not sure if they will look into this situation more closely to prevent this problem in the future or not but check product for evidence of dirt if you are purchasing this product in the future.<br /><br />Update (2/27/12) - Davidson's did get back with me and sent me a new bag without charge when filling out the Amazon claim form.  Have not opened up the new bag to see if the quality has improved, but replacement bag was appreciated.",Clump of dirt found in product,2

"So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'.  It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions.  I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy.  They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought.  AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes.

"Like many high-carbohydrate instant ""soups,"" the Lentil Couscous Soup is more couscous than soup.  Preparation is easy, although mine boiled over when prepared according to the very precise (1 minute, 40 seconds) cooking time in the instructions.  I would have preferred a more vague time endpoint and directions to watch for boiling.  The resulting food is quite bland as other reviewers have noted, and what this ""low-sodium"" (330 mg) soup really needed was more salt.  The flavors that were present were nondescript, neither the couscous nor the lentils providing a distinctive flavor note.  I kept looking at the package to see what kind of flavor I should have been expecting.  The texture was also pretty monotonous, and the couscous itself did not have the best texture, which was disappointing because good couscous is not that hard to make.  As for healthy eating, the product is essentially pasta with lentils added to provide some protein and fiber, and with 37 grams of carbs the 190 calories are pretty empty -- not all that much different from macaroni with low-fat cheese.

"Bought these in bulk because it was cheaper.  Have the spaghetti, fettuccine, and the rice.  When you open the bag it has an odd odor, not necessarily what I would call fishy, more of a preservative smell that goes away when the noodles are rinsed.  I made fettuccine carbonara last night with the noodles. Honestly, the taste was fantastic, I mean who doesn't love bacon!  The noodles truly have no taste, and take on the flavor of what they're cooked with.  But attempting to chew the noodle was a different story! The texture is like nothing I've experienced and is kind of hard to describe.  You really have to chew these noodles.  The texture is a cross between spongy, gelatinous, and squishy shrimp or meat.  That said, the texture won out over taste, if I focused on the texture it took everything I had in me not to gag! For me texture is as important as taste, and I just couldn't get past it.  Since I have so many, I will be figuring out how to use them and I have some suggestions to make them more palatable.  First, get out your scissors and cut those noodles into smaller pieces, the less you have to chew, the better.  After you have rinsed the noodles in hot water, dry them on low heat in a frying pan with a touch of olive oil.  The noodles retain moisture and Without being thoroughly dried, they can make your dishes more watery.  If you have an iron stomach, and know you can overcome texture, these can be a healthy pasta substitute.  Do not expect them to have a pasta texture though!",Very odd texture,2

"We enjoy our morning coffee and, years ago, bought an espresso machine to stop paying so much money over to Starbucks.  Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.<br /><br />Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.<br /><br />The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.

Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer!

I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested.

I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again.

"Purchasing the Glace De Volaille Gourmet Gold Roasted Turkey Stock from Amazom. I used the reccomended old world gravy recipe of sauteing onions, carrots in duck fat with a cup of wine. It did not inspire me.  The traditional basted American Turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted.  The aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses, exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy.  This cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy, deaden in wine, brown onions and thyme. Maybe the old world tastes are more astute, but my American gravy will remain simply traditional.

The idea behind buying this is to have a natural pick-me-up in the morning.  The problem is they have doses of things in it that are too high.

"Before trying this product, I tried making a native starter, just picking up whatever yeast was flying around in the air in Austin, Texas. That worked from a functional point of view, but had no sour flavor.<br /><br />In the process, I got myself a nice glass jar (formerly a Clausen pickle jar) punched holes in the lid. I made sure to use wooden utensils when mixing. I went to the baby aisle of the grocery store and got a bottle of distilled water to make sure there would be no chlorine present.<br /><br />Everything worked as described all over the place...very active starter...somewhat slow rising...pretty good bread texture...just no sour flavor.<br /><br />So I purchased this product.<br /><br />I followed the instructions carefully, feeding every 12 hours, using a glass container, stirring with wooden chopsticks and using distilled water.  It took three days to activate and another day or two to get very reliable...and at that point it was....indistinguishable from the local starter.

Yes, Yes, Yes, definitely yes.<br /><br />Upon opening the envelope I was overwhelmed by the aroma and checked the envelope again to make sure I hadn't opened a package of loose tobacco. The brewed coffee didn't smell any better as the kitchen was filled with a smell like a dirty ashtray. The taste is not better. I dutifully drank three cups so I could give it a fair assessment, and the last cup tasted as bad as the first. I even added a spoonfull of chocolate powder to the last cup to make it palatable. That only helped marginally.<br /><br />I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It may be low acid and make one's tummy feel better, but it's a big price to pay for the comfort. Now I'm disappointed that I still have a little of this stuff left. Definitely don't recommend this flavor.<br /><br />Why didn't I give this foul tasting brew one star?

Before opening this package I read the ingrediants and daily values. There was an advantage in the lack of saturated fats which was pleasing to me. I had the Olive flavored variety. I found the chips to be tasty but a little dry and lacking the olive flavor I had expected. I THOUGHT I tasted an olive experience in the first bite but did not taste it again. By saying I thought it was dry may have been the thought that the product may have been a little old OR had the same sensation in my mouth as stale varieties I have bitten into in the past.

"Summary: Set an alarm to wake up 4.5 hours after falling asleep, take around 10mL of tincture and then go back to sleep for strongly enhanced dream recall, vividness, and possible lucid dreams, OBEs or other phenomena.<br /><br />I have been a lucid dreamer for over a year now, usually having 1-2 per week as well as remembering 2+ dreams most night, so I'm pretty in tune to noticing a change in my dreams. When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness. Since then I have experimented with a few different doses, and for the most part have had success by taking 7mL+ a few hours after going to sleep.","works, but it takes alot",3

"Generally, I like having a box dinner around for times when I don't want to cook much or run out of other foods.  And we have a homemade chicken broccoli and rice casserole we really like, so I thought we'd like this.  For the first few bites we did, but quickly the cheesy taste became extremely rich and unappetizing.<br /><br />The box contains an orzo pasta, a packet of dried seasonings, a packet of dried broccoli, and a large foil packet of Velveeta cheese. To make this, you brown up some chicken breast that has been cut into bite size pieces, then add the orzo and spices and water.  After it simmers a while, add the broccoli and simmer more, then add the cheese sauce.  It's pretty simple, much like any other box dinner on the market.<br /><br />The orzo pasta was very good, I liked it a lot.  The seasonings seemed kind of bland but were adequate.  The broccoli is nonexistent, really.  It's just about 2 tablespoons of dried flakes that don't rehydrate much when cooking.  You can see little tiny green dots throughout the finished dish, but there is no broccoli flavor to speak of.  Frankly, I thought there was too much cheese sauce as well.  About an ounce less of sauce would have been perfect.  It coated everything well and looked good, but the cheese sauce was the main culprit in making the entire dish overly rich in both taste and texture.  We paired this with fresh raw veggies for something to cut the cheesiness and it still was too much.<br /><br />I think this particular skillet would have been better without chicken in it, instead as a side dish with some chicken made separately.  If Velveeta made a boxed side dish that was just orzo, seasoning, and cheese in appropriate proportions, I would definitely buy it.",too rich and a heavy processed taste,3

Overall, I immensely enjoyed the honey and pomegranate flavoring. It can be a tad sweet but you can always add water or use less mix to compensate. The only concern is the time it takes for the mix to dissolve. Many other mixes are able to dissolve almost instantly; however, with Lipton's, you've got to shake the drink for at least a good five minutes before the mix clumps completely breakdown otherwise you'll be feeling granules of mix grating in your mouth.

"When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)",Just had a glass today,3
"Full disclosure - I worked briefly for the people who make this product back in the late '70s.  Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it.  And it's not bad - it's OK, but it's just a bit odd.<br /><br />First off, the packaging.  These aren't your father's K-Cup, where it's an actual cup.  These have a top like the traditional cup (so they'll fit in the brewer) but the bottom is completely different.  It's almost more like a filter than a cup, and kinda rounded rather than cup-shaped.  They come in sealed plastic bags of twelve, so you need to keep them in a ziplock bag or some kind of airtight container once you open the bag, unless you're planning on using them all right away.<br /><br />Second, the flavor.  It's OK, not bad at all, but it just tastes a little off for some reason.  A hint of odd flavor.  Also, it seems to lack body, for want of a better term.  It doesn't have that rich, full, satisfying flavor I expect from a good cup of French Roast.<br /><br />Lastly, it seems to leave more sediment in the bottom of the cup than traditional K-Cups - not sure if that's a by-product of the design or what.<br /><br />Bottom line - it's not like I'm going to throw them away.  I'll keep them and drink them, but I probably won't buy them again.  I much prefer the flavor of just about any regular K-Cup to these, even non-premium brands like Folger's.<br /><br />UPDATE: After drinking my way through the whole case and comparing them with other K-Cup products, I have a bit more appreciation for these and might consider buying them again, particularly given the excellent price of around 38 cents a cup if you use Subscribe and Save.  One other point I neglected to mention in my original review is that these seem to produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam that appears on top of a good cup of coffee - than most K-Cup products.  Keep an eye out for my reviews of the Rainforest Blend (which I found somewhat weak and flavorless) and Fog Chaser (which just arrived and I've yet to sample) varieties coming soon.","Not bad, but decidedly unlike any other K-Cup product",3

"Ive tried a few other brand energy drinks and never liked the taste of any. Regardless I would drink the horrible tasting drinks to have the energy without the crash when needed and they did work. I found this No Fear Super Energy Supplement to give the same amount of energy but alot more to drink. The taste was not as bad though as the others - it was decently flavored and ok to drink rather then horrible tasting. It has a cherry flavor taste like cola. It is a 16 ounce can though compared to some 2oz drinks so there is alot more to drink. Keep in mind though the can is 2 servings... I prefer the smaller bottles to a big can.<br /><br />When I compare this to 5 hour energy the ones I am use to the flavor is far better with this drink. BUT its alot more can to drink to feel an affect which I actually then prefer the nasty tasting stuff as its a quick gulp and thats it... rather then a whole can to down. I feel more energized wit ha 5 hour energy, you can totally feel the difference. I did not have that same affect with this- it felt like it was starting to work and I was waiting for that full blown kick in energy but it never came. I can take a 5 hour when exhausted and I'm wide awake and alert for 5 hours no problem. With this I  could still head to bed if I desired.<br /><br />I do like the look of the can, its pretty cool looking but, what matters is inside the can. Energy drinks work differently for everyone. I'd recommend trying a few just a can or 2 from each til you find what works best for you. For me, its still 5 hour energy","Better Tasting, Less Energy, Big 16oz Can....",3

"I got a can of the Illy Issimo coffee drink to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I also review the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> which I liked quite a bit.  I wasn't as much a fan of this coffee drink as I was of the Cappuccino.<br /><br />The coffee drink comes in a pressurized can, so remember not to shake before opening or you will have a mess on your hands.  It's a pretty little can and is fairly sweet tasting.  They use real sugar to sweeten which it nice.<br /><br />I thought the coffee drink was a bit bitter despite the sweetness and that it didn't pack all that large of a punch.  It was okay but definitely not the best.  I personally enjoyed the Cappuccino version of this drink better, it wasn't so sweet or bitter and packed more of a caffeine boost.<br /><br />Overall it was okay, it you like coffee convenience items this one is lower in calories and uses real sugar.

"Some might argue that, just as there's no such thing as bad sex, there's no such thing as bad chocolate. (Even the worst of the latter I've ever consumed - in Leningrad, Russia in 1984 - was still edible. My history with the former we needn't discuss.)<br /><br />So, here we have NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE (NOODC). Mind you, it doesn't contain such poncy embellishments such as almonds, macadamia nuts, cherries, pomegranate, mint chips, bacon shreds, rice krispies, orange peel, caramel filling, peanut butter, raisins, walnut pieces, toffee crunch, coconut, red pepper, coffee beans, cranberries, blueberries, white chocolate chunks, or the kitchen sink. It's just 100% chocolate, i.e. evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, and vanilla - all organic, of course. (It must be pointed out, however, that vanilla is used by chocolate makers to mask the flavor of imperfectly roasted cocoa beans. Hmm.)<br /><br />At 54% cocoa, NOODC isn't particularly elevated on that scale. Who in a chocolate company determines the what and why of an optimum concentration, I wonder? Probably the (cocoa) bean counters, I imagine.<br /><br />Because I have a taste disorder described more fully in my review of the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618861882"">Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense</a>, I can't judge the sweetness of this candy, but only the chocolate flavor and the ""mouth feel."" Both are pretty much average and acceptable. Is it better than one of my favorite brands, a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CH40HQ"">Cadbury Royal Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.5 oz, 24 count</a> bar? Uh ... no. But, it's infinitely better than that Commie chocolate eaten back in the nostalgic good old days of the Cold War! I mean, without any of the added embellishments mentioned above, a plain chocolate bar has to work overtime to stand out from the rest of that genre on the shelf.<br /><br />Actually, I was more interested in the subtleties of the label. Paul himself is pictured with Nell, his daughter by Joanne Woodward. Nell started the Organics Division of Newman's Own in 1993, and remained at its head when it chipped-off the old block in 2001. Dad still lent his support, though, before he died. I gather it's Nell`s leadership and participation that's inferred in the confectionary's subtitle, ""The Second Generation.""<br /><br />Again, according to the labeling, the cocoa has been certified by the ""Rainforest Alliance."" Perhaps I'm being cynical, but it makes me wonder how much Nell's company tips this outfit for the granting of its certification, however legitimate such a ritual blessing may be. Similarly, there's the notation ""Certified Organic by Oregon Tilth"" - whatever a ""Tilth"" is.<br /><br />Also, there's the usual CYA disclaimer: ""Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat soy, and egg."" The potential hazards for allergy sufferers aside, how might those possible contaminants affect the organic quality of NOODC if they themselves aren't organic? Inquiring minds want to know. (Perhaps the ""USDA Organic"" sticker carries implications here. I'll certainly sleep better at night knowing the guv'mint is involved.)<br /><br />And the fact that a 1 bar serving size contains only 5 mg of sodium means that my wife could chow down the whole thing - minus the single bite I was tossed - without fear of elevating her already borderline-high blood pressure. After all, dark chocolate is reportedly a health food.<br /><br />Would I buy NOODC on at the local chain supermarket without it being at a bargain, club price? Probably not. I've never been convinced that ""organic"" isn't mostly a marketing ploy to raise the sticker, and NOODC at full price doesn't give more satisfaction than a less expensive bar laden with assorted impurities, toxins, and carcinogens. And both go down equally well with a glass of cold, non-fat moo.",Is there such a thing as bad chocolate?,3

"I first tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MO765O"">EZ-Sweetz 2-ounce bottle)</a>, and I loved the convenience and carb savings over Splenda.  But to make a pitcher of lemonade (which is what I use it for most often), I had to use 60 drops, which got tedious.  So I decided to try this version, since it is twice as concentrated.  This has made it a lot more convenient for me, plus, with the 2-ounce bottle, I was always taken by surprise when it suddenly ran out.  With this three-pack, I know to order another box when I'm down to my last bottle.  Both versions are great, but based on those two advantages, I will probably buy this one from now on.<br /><br />In my experience, the conversion ratio for EZ-Sweetz versus sugar or Splenda in a recipe is not quite as described.  I've always had to use more Splenda than what its manufacturer says is the sugar equivalent, and with EZ-Sweetz, I have to use a little more than what they claim as the Splenda equivalent (I haven't noticed any problem with the claim of this EZ-Sweetz being twice as concentrated as the 2-ounce version; I use 30 drops now).  But still, it's such a huge savings of carbs (and even calories), it's a good product to get.<br /><br />Update 8/27/12 - The first several packages I got were very easy to dispense.  However, the past two packages I've purchased have required a much tighter squeeze to get them to drip.  If you only need one or two drops, it's not a big deal.  But when you're counting out 30 for a big pitcher of lemonade, it becomes downright *painful*.  I thought the first batch was a fluke (though it was all three bottles).  But now this batch (ordered more than a month later) is just as bad.  I've dropped my star rating as a result, and I'll be looking for different product to switch to.","Great sweetener, though overpriced and hard to dispense",3

"It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice. I just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples, and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-I'm guessing it was either expired, or had gone bad so don't let that scare you away from trying it-you might like it. As for me,I need something with bigger particles so maybe I'll just do a homemade scrub with sugar-or better yet, I can add a little sugar to the scrub to make it more effective.

It isn't terrible (or even bad) and I think the price is right....it just isn't a white tea mainstay for me.  -1 for bag packaging too...I know it keeps the cost down but good tins are always nice (especially in bulk).<br /><br />verdict: good buy if you can't afford to always drink silver needle because you drink so much...you will still want to have silver needle on hand though :)",par,3

My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it.,Using to give my dog her daily medicines,3

"I'm counting carbs, and I ordered these hoping they would provide an alternative for me to high-carbohydrate snacks. The similar veggie chips I have bought in the grocery store list 2 grams of carbs; this product lists 18g; fiber - only 2g -- that's 16 net carbs, way too many allowed on my diet. It would be helpful to have the nutrition facts presented on the product page before purchase (or if it is there - I missed it). Sugar is not listed as an ingredient so I am not sure why these are so high in carbs as the similar product with 2grams lists the same ingredients: sweet potato, squash, carrot, green bean, and taro. The other figures are not bad: calories: 130, fat calories, 50, total fat: 6g; saturated fat: 0g; trans fat: 0g. Although on my low carb diet, I don't have to worry so much about calories and fat.

"I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.  The weather here is mild, not very hot or very cold.  When I opened the box and sampled the chocolates I immediately noticed a stale and unpalatable taste.  I recognized this taste from what occurs when chocolate is frozen or exposed to refrigerated air.  I responded to an email from Amazon asking for a review of my purchase.  I recounted my experience.  I received an email from Leonidas claiming that to their knowledge the product was not sent damaged.  Leonidas stated they would replace my order.  They have not.  I emailed Leonidas again asking about their intentions to replace my order.  I have received no reply.  Amazon attached a statement to the email I received from Leonidas disavowing any responsibility for Leonidas' product or the delivery of it.  So, here is my response: I will make no more purchases of food stuffs from Leonidas until a refund or replacement is forth coming.  I understand Amazon's position, but as a consumer of many items purchased via the Internet, I think that Amazon needs to review their policy regarding 3rd party vendors.  This is the first time any product I have purchase from Amazon had a problem.  I am somewhat shocked that their attitude towards my problem is: you're own your own.",Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment,3

"When I opened my Eastman 38237 Jerky and Sausage Gun kit, I noticed that the piston seal made of a nylon like material was damaged with a tear very evident. Perhaps it was damaged when the cylinder was placed over it(inserted) because the cylinder entrance on both sides is not chamfered at all and presents a sharp edge to the flexible lip seal. In any case it seemed like the damage wouldn't prevent me from trying to stuff my first batch of sausage. I only tried to stuff about 3.5 lbs of meat with this device and I would say, that is about the most I would try unaided. The control was excellent in terms of moving the meat mixture into the casing even if slow. My biggest disappointment was the tediousness of filling the narrow tube with fresh meat. It seems like the narrow tube holds a bit under 1 pound per loading. The small diameter of the tube made it difficult to refill with the sticky meat mixture without creating massive air pockets. I have to admit that the manufacturer responded to my damage complaint and sent me a new kit free of charge.<br />It is a completely different model (38239) which I haven't found too much information yet. The tube, piston and mechanism are completely different and the tube is now chamfered. Instead of screwing on and off the tube to refill, the tube slips out of the cage type holder. In addition, the new one's mechanism for advancing the piston is now completely open instead of closed which should allow for the ability to thoroughly clean it. I haven't tried it yet but I think it may be a better choice for small batches than the original one. However its tube diameter (1-7/8"") is even smaller than the original (2"")so it will hold even less meat and be more difficult to refill. These small, caulking gun types of stuffers are ideal for the small home sausage maker, but when I decide to stuff more than about 3-4 pounds at a time, I will have to invest in something more appropriate.<br />I would say that the value was very good for the price, but it's probably a better jerky maker than a sausage stuffer due to its size.",Quality control fair,3

"As soon as I got this I opened it to taste it, very crunchy and sweet. I like to carry this kind of tid bit to nibble on while I am out and about.  I even gave a few to my dog, he liked it, but he'll eat anything.<br />In the morning I tried it with milk, I am not a cereal person but this appealed to me because it seemed like it would have a Cheerios flavor, it does not.  The only problem, which is why I am not a cereal person is the sweetness, it is too sweet.  The longer it lingers in the milk the more sugar oozes out.  I had to pour out some milk and add fresh to cut the sugar.  I must say it stays crunchy in milk, after 6 minutes the crunch was still there.  So if  you like crunch this one is for you.

So we're just rating it as coffee, not as a lower-acid alternative. As coffee, it was pretty average, with a mild, wimpy sort of taste.

"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.",What it is....,3

"I thought this was a fantastic idea - I've never liked the mushiness of Fig Newtons so I hoped this would be a tasty way to get the flavor without the fuss.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the strong flavor of cinnamon.  I mean, it's really strong - I can smell it before I take a bite and it dominates the cookie flavor.  This certainly isn't a problem if you're a cinnamon fan, but it isn't what I expected, based on the package's description.  The cookies themselves are very thin and crispy - rather like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029YA89S"">Moravian Cookies</a> if you've ever had those.  The honey's not really noticeable, other than a vague sweetness that could easily be sugar or some other sweetener.  The real disappointment is the fig.  I can't exactly taste the tiny diced fragments of fruit, because they're so little, but they're sticky enough that I still find them stuck to my teeth after I've swallowed the cookie.<br /><br />I love thin ""cracker-like"" cookies generally, so I was pleased with these overall, but the little fig ""chips"" were disappointing for flavor and mouth feel. I might have to try the other Fruit Thins in the Newton family - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEP5VQ"">Raspberry Chocolate</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GA"">Blueberry Brown Sugar</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968"">Cranberry Citrus Oats</a> - to see if the execution was better with another fruit.",Call it a Cinnamon 'Thin' with fig bits for a more accurate name.,3

"Anyone who has a food processor can make far better... And you can make better by using real bacon!  For what this large cannister of bacon salt cost me I could have fried up 3 lbs of lean crispy bacon, bought a cannister of salt, pulled all the fat off my crisp bacon and tossed that bacon in the food processor with the sharp blade until it was pulverized to a fine powder.  Then I add the salt and pulse it a few times to incorporate as I think that salt probably isn't the best for my sharp metal blade.  Instant bacon salt and way better!  Want the other flavors?  Add a few drops of hickory liquid smoke to pick it up a notch.  Jalapeno bacon salt?  Buy some fresh jalapenos and dry them in the oven then toss them in with the bacon when you pulverize.  This isn't rocket science and I agree with other posts... if ya want to know what this tastes like just buy a bottle of bacos and smash them into a salt like substance to sprinkle around.

"After reading other reviews on this coffee, I was conviced I had to try it.  It's o.k., but really tastes much more like the cheaper WalMart brand coffee.  It doesn't even compare to Starbucks, not even close.  I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.  I'm gonna try roasting the beans a little more myself to see if that makes any difference. I've never done that, but at this point, with 4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans left, I have to try something to make them taste better..  If that works out, I'll post again, but I'm not holding out much hope.  If you want really great coffee, you should look elsewhere, Coffee Bean Direct is just not cutting it...Good luck.<br /><br />July 9th,2012:  Update.  Well, I tried ""roasting"" the beans a little more.  Took a small amount and put them in the toaster oven for 15 min. at 400 degree.  They smelled good, but tasted horrible.  So I'm using the beans as I bought them, and making due.  Still not the great coffee I had hoped for, but drinkable.  Someone wrote a review of these beans talking about how they had a ""chocolaty and vanilla"" flavor.  Way off base! Or, it was someone at coffeebeandirect.com with a phony review.  Not even close.  When I am finished struggling thru this five pound bag, NO MORE..!","OK, but will not order again",3

"These weren't awful, they just weren't good. The combination of flavors is actually nice because you can't go wrong without chocolate and coconut, but the texture just ruins it all. I do understand that often gluten free baking has its obstacles to overcome, but these bars feel like they want to be cake-like but wind up powdery and almost tough at the same time. Basically, they have the sort of texture one imagines a ""gluten free"" product would have (although it doesn't have to be this way!) And while I love almonds, their presence only adds to the unpleasant feeling this bar has in the mouth.<br />Luckily, I'm not gluten free, but if I were I imagine these would be nice in a pinch though I wouldn't seek them out just to have around.",Not so great,3

"At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",Really sweet but sort of tasty,3

"I love cashews and I love pepper. The first time I bought these I thought they were great. Then a friend gave a canister to me as a gift and they had tried Sea Salt& Pepper cashews and they were not sure they liked them. I was surprised by their comment and then tried some of the cashews from their canister and immediately noted that they were much saltier than the cashews I had tried previously. I later tried the cashews they had given me as a gift and those too were much too salty! I thought at that time maybe it was just a ""bad batch"". I had almost decided to not buy any more but then gave them one more try and once again found them delicious and not too salty! I have bought more since then and some are too salty and others are not! I plan on letting Emerald (Diamond Foods) know about the inconsistency because when they are not too salty they are REALLY good!!!<br />Update: 7/12/2012. Diamond Foods responded promptly to my complaint that the product is inconsistent by sending me a coupon for $5.99. But unfortunately the product continues to be very inconsistent.

"Chocolate and healthy just doesn't mix well. These bars are no different. And at 190 calories for one bar (and the bar is actually way smaller than the wrapper)  it's just not worth it, especially if it doesn't even taste all that great. These bars have a consistency of the fake, Little Debbie brownies, mixed with an earthy, dirt texture, and just a hint of bird food. The actual chocolate flavor is very masked and the almonds are completely tasteless.  There is almost no redeaming quality for them, aside from the fact that I've actually eaten far worse chocolate bars. There are FAR better, healthy alternatives for chocolate lovers who actually want something good out of their indulgence. South Beach Living Fiber Fit Mocha Granola Bars are pretty much the best one's I've eaten in the healthy category. At least they actually taste delicious AND have fiber.

"Of course, I like this cereal, it's like frosted cheerios with marshmallows, but I wanted to review the internet buying option. Most food products, especially candy, is a rip-off from most Amazon sellers. However, the cereal is usually cheap. I think the 11.5oz was about $2.60 at Wal-Mart, but I paid  only $6.86 for the 1 package of 3 boxes here on Amazon, so that is about $2.29 for each box. That was a good deal, but now the page says $15 for 3 boxes, which is $5 a box. That is a rip for the 11.5oz box; you can get a 16oz box for only about $3.00 at Wal-Mart. So you have to watch the prices to see if it's cheaper or not.<br /><br />I was worried about the cereal not being fresh, but it is. My Lucky Charms were the new ones with the new marshmallows in them; currently it's the different colors of shooting stars. My boxes from Amazon have the same expiration date as the Frosted Flakes I bought at Wal-Mart, so that's a good thing. They taste good too (just in case there is other problems that could be wrong with them).<br /><br />So overall, check the prices to see if it is worth it, the prices change both in the store and online, alot (mostly they change online, though).

"Disclaimer: A free sample of these bars were received from Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The Pure Natural bars are gluten free protein snack bars.

"The box contains a true cross-section of coffee types, from flavored types to darkest roast. The Rainforest Espresso was a favorite dark roast, and the Columbian Dorado was the ideal medium roaster (IMO). Others in my family have different tastes though, so your mileage may vary as well.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the heavy presence of teas included here, raised the cost-per-cup significantly. Nobody in our home likes hot teas, and although I did get one good iced-tea conversion, the effort expended removes convenience from the picture.<br /><br />Bottom line: Timothy, you need a coffee-only variety pack!!

"We loved these at first.  While we thought the salt and pepper was very powerful, the cashews themselves were large and flavorful, and the whole thing really worked.

"This basket is very attractively packaged; the sweets are well displayed and the basket is fairly nice, as this sort of thing goes.  The bow is attractive enough to save, and the basket holds a good variety, from biscotti to candy.  The frustration-free packaging was easy to open and protected the contents very well.<br /><br />The contents made nice snacks paired with coffee, with flavors running from very good to just so-so.  The Cashew Roca is delicious, as Roca-brand treats always are, to my taste.  The chocolate chip cookies barely earn the name, as they are very sandy shortbread (a texture unlike any I expect when I think ""chocolate chip cookies"") with tiny, scarce chips too small even to taste chocolaty.  The fudge is tasty, although there are only two small pieces.<br /><br />Therein lies my chief complaint:  All of the items are very over-packaged for the amount of food they actually contain, making the basket appear much more generous than it actually is.  For example, the fudge box measures 3 x 4 inches (that's it on the right in the picture of the filled basket), containing two pieces of fudge that measure just over an inch square:  12 square inches of box for about 2 inches of fudge.  The Roca box (on the left in the picture) is 6 x 3-1/2 inches, with three small pieces of Roca in it.  The cookie box was about 24 square inches, containing 2 ounces of itsy-bitsy cookies (each is about the size of a quarter).<br /><br />There is no dishonesty in advertising here, as the basket clearly lists contents of just 11.9 ounces.  However, the appearance is one of a large, bountiful basket full of treats, but it actually doesn't contain very much once all the packaging is disposed of.<br /><br />At the right price, I would suggest this as a nice, small gift with an interesting variety of treats -- emphasis being on small.","Good, but small",3

I called my doctor and he said that was weird, that it should not be the tea.  So, I tried it again.  Those sores came right back.  Maybe it is my body ""detoxifying"" itself?

"I've never had tea before that was in this form. But it really isn't tea. As the name states it is a ""beverage"" not a tea. It comes in a packet that dissolves in hot water. Gold Kili has a very strong (spicy) ginger flavor. It is difficult to describe taste in writing, but I'll try to be clear that this is a very very strong ginger spice. If you like it very strong, I am sure you mayenjoy this. As a ""beverage mix"" (in contrast to tea) it does save you having to wait for tea to steep because it dissolves instantly. In addition you don't have to clean up a tea bag. It also has sugar (sucrose) already mixed in.<br /><br />The downside is that if you prefer your drink without sweetener or perhaps with a no calorie sweetener like Truvia, that is not an option here because the honey is already mixed in.",Beverage comparison to ginger tea,3

"I am a fan of broccoli, especially with mac & cheese.  So, I had hoped there was quite a bit of broccoli flavor in these boxes.  What I got instead was all ""flavor"" and not much broccoli at all.  There are two packets and one has about 1-2 tablespoons of dehydrated broccoli and the other has a flavoring that slightly smells like broccoli but mostly just seems salty.  The kraft macaroni / noodle product is pretty much exactly like Kraft Deluxe thought the noodles may be slightly different shaped.  You get a packet of liquid Kraft cheese and this to me is way too salty, seems just like canned nacho cheese dip.  I think the powdered cheese packets they offer in standard mac & cheese boxes have more flavor and seem to taste less salty.  I found that for the money, I could just as easily buy boxed mac & cheese (any flavor including organic or whole wheat) and add frozen chopped broccoli (which usually comes in a very large bag for just a buck or two).  Considering this box assumes you will add grocery bought chicken anyway, you could just as easily buy broccoli as well.  The extra cost of this box just for the small amount of dehydrated broccoli is not necessary.  I found that I could eat healthier & cheaper for the same cooking time by buying these products seperately, hopefully this will help your decision making.",Not Enough Broccoli For Me,3

When I finally got done, the soup was great.  Don't know if I would buy again unless the salt is cut in half (at least).  I am sure the Ministrone must have suffered from the same problem - I don't remember - I do remember my son & I liked it very much - I have been unable to find it at my grocery again, though.

"I don't have any real ""issues"" with this product.  The small packages are fine for a small batch, which of course is the reason for these small envelopes instead of a large can.  Sometimes you'll open a large can and if you don't use it, then it becomes ""stale"".  But on the other hand, bread crumbs can be a lot less expensive.  Also, if you want to spice-it-up, then try adding a little extra seasoning. . . . For example, a little cayenne pepper or hot pepper flakes.  Perhaps a bit of Mrs. Dash.  How about a touch of garlic powder.  You might also try jerk seasoning. . . Cajon seasoning. .  .or other dry seasoning blend.","Easy, but bread crumbs are less expensive",3

The negatives are that a fairly small serving size (one ounce) has 7 grams of fat because these chips are fried, not baked.

This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.<br /><br />I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.<br /><br />21 March 2012 Update<br /><br />I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose.

"While the premise of this drink is good (all juice, no sugar added), it fell short for me.<br /><br />First of all - the taste. While supposedly Black Cherry, I tasted a hint more grape than black cherry. And, the ingredients label confirms that the primary juice is Apple, then Grape, and THEN acerola and black cherry. It's not a bad taste, but not one I was expecting.<br /><br />Secondly, if you're looking for a dietary drink, look elsewhere. Although the label would lead you to believe with ""no sugar added"", the nutrition facts give the real story for all this juice: 130 calories in the tiny 8.3 oz can!<br /><br />For comparison, that's MORE calories than Coca Cola Classic (97 calories in 8 oz).<br /><br />To be fair, this can of Switch should be better for you in moderation - it has 100% of your daily Vitamin C, and no corn syrup (unlike Coke).<br /><br />One final note - the label claims ""100% juice carbonated"", but this is juice from concentrate, reconstituted with sparkling water.<br /><br />Ultimately for me, the small portion, high calorie count, and just-ok taste will leave me with other choices.

The shampoo and conditioners I am used to cost 3 to 4 as much as these. Because of this, I didn't expect any improvement in the condition of my already very healthy hair after using these products. While I wouldn't consider the condition of my hair improved after seven days of using these products, I was pleased that the condition of my hair was pretty much maintained. Despite my hair feeling okay after using these products, I won't be giving up my usual products. I like to mix it up with my shampoo & conditioner, so I will continue to use these occasionally, but not every day. One of the main things I'm not crazy about with these products is the fragrance. It's not that they don't smell good; they smell okay. Not my favorite scent, but it's fine. The issue is more that I don't feel like the scent stays with my hair. I don't wear perfume and rarely use any kind of body fragrance, so it's important to me that my shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair smelling nice.

"I was intrigued by this Black Cherry carbonated 100% juice. I have to admit, on my first taste, I hated it. But I took a few more sips, I began to get used to it and like it a bit more. I could definitely taste the cherry in the drink and a hint of apple. Although, I'm not big on carbonated drinks that aren't soda. Also it may have a lot of pluses in what it doesn't put into your drink but if you're watching your calorie intake, The Switch Black Cherry has 130 calories and it's no different than what some soda and juice (like lemonade) have.

"It was somewhat thirst quenching, but I was not totally satisfied. Maybe it was because the 8.5 oz. size seems like less than I want after I really work out. Maybe it was because the coconut guava flavor (both are flavors which I actually love) seemed super watered down...they should have added more guava! The upshot?

"I've been a fan of Jack Links beef jerky for a long time.  This product, however, sorta scares me now that I've tried it.  They are dyed red and don't have a sausage-like consistency at all.

An individually wrapped red, soft hot dog steeped in a vinegar-based hot sauce.<br /><br />The heat and tang are good, but the consistency is a bit too soft for me.  I'd love them if they were a bit less mushy and didn't mention the organ meat on the label.  Make sure to try one before buying in bulk.<br /><br />I'm not condemning the product or people who like it.  It just wasn't what I expected.

"I am beginning to think all Honey & Nut cereals are the same. I did not find Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal to be any different in taste from the other leading brands. It has the same sweetness, crunchiness and texture as the others. I would suggest reading the nutrition facts to compare this cereal to your usual brand of honey & nut cereal to see if one is nutritionally better. According to the box, a serving is 3/4 of a cup of Crunchy Nut cereal and contains 140 calories with 1/2 cup of fat-free milk. Each serving holds 1g of fat, 125mg of sodium, 23g of carbs (10g from sugars), and 2g of protein.<br /><br />On a side note, I am finding Amazon to be in line with grocery store prices, especially if you sign up for automatic deliveries and purchase in bulk.

"Despite of my initial disappointment with the distilled vinegar that arrived and the items received not being the same as the ones pictured in the Amazon.com profile I decided to raise number of stars from 2 to 3. 3 stars are for the misleading photos in the product profile and the different items in the package that I received (please read the details below). The mother culture itself is wonderful and produced beautiful, absolutely great tasting kombucha in one week and a gorgeous scoby.<br /><br />The package arrived in a reasonable time. However, the starter liquid came in a PLASTIC bottle and only enough to start one quart of kombucha. The description ( of the product on Amazon.com)regarding the contents of the package was not specific enough. The photograph shows a plastic bag with Scoby and liquid, a mysterious brown bag/envelope and what it looks like instructions sheet. Another photograph shows a jar labeled : Kombucha Starter. NONE of these items were included in the package I received. I received a small ziploc bag with Scoby, instructions sheet and a small plastic bottle labeled: ""Starter Liquid"". When I opened the bottle  I realized it is nothing but distilled vinegar. After studying the ways of how to start kombucha tea process I learned that the starter should be the already fermented kombucha tea. According to the seller: Lifetime Kefir company instructions, white distilled vinegar can also be used. Then why isn't the tiny PLASTIC bottle containing WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR labeled as such? Why use such deception? Starter liquid should be the fermented kombucha tea. I do not think it is so expensive that it cannot be included instead of WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR. The only reason I am not going to return this package is that it is not worth my time.",Somewhat disapointed,3

About an hour and a half after eating one, my abdomen puffs up like a balloon filled with air, resulting in a very sore, achy feeling tummy and (excuse me) painful gas that lasts about three hours.<br /><br />Many people have this reaction to maltitol; if you're one of them, you'll have to learn, as I painfully have, to avoid anything that contains this sweetener.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company can make some maltitol-free versions of these bars in the future.",I Like These Bars But They Don't Like Me,3

"Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.","Good, but not great",3
"I'm a noodle lover. Can't live without noodles at least once a day. I have more than a dozen different types of noodles stocked in my pantry & I love trying new ones too. I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 24 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef ""chunks"" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet.

"Of the different varieties I tried of these Barilla pasta meals, this was just okay.  The wheat pasta was a bit mushy and I didn't like the texture/taste.  My sister and niece (who I was sharing this with) agreed that the pasta could have been a little more al dente, but they liked the pasta and thought this was better than the other ones we tried.  We all liked the sauce - sweet with chunks of vegetables.<br /><br />Overall, the one minute in the microwave was plenty of time - meal was hot enough.  The top - a sealed piece of plastic that you peel off over the sauce to cook then fully remove to pour the sauce over the pasta - is a bit difficult to remove.  I slopped some sauce trying to get it off so if you're making these at work, be careful.<br /><br />Calorie wise, this was just over 300 calories and had 11 grams of fiber.

By the time I got through the entire 12 pack I could no longer bear the thought of having to drink the rest of them. This isn't to say that the product wasn't decent and I might be inclined to want to drink it again, once in a blue moon, i.e., very rarely; it just didn't have the same light refreshing properties that I have perviously found in other brands.<br /><br />As a once a month treat I could find myself enjoying this, but the overly sweet taste makes me refrain from wanting to consume anymore.",Way too sweet for my tastes,3

"I liked the coffee, it was bold but not bitter. I can't recommend though, due to at least 6 k-cups ""blowing up"" in my Keurig.<br /><br />The whole point of the Keurig is that it's quick, easy, and you get a decent cup of coffee out of it. When you're running late in the morning, and the seal around the K-Cup breaks and coffee / grounds go all over and you've got to clean it up, it's no longer a convenience and is a huge of a hassle.<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Tully's, I've gone through 4 boxes (200 pcs) so far and not a single ""blow up"".","Coffee was great, but too many defective cups...",3
"Ok, so my cats aren't really ""petite"", well except for the one, but I think they still enjoyed these snacks.  In fact, 4 out of 5 cats in my household enjoyed these treats.  There are some really great things about this brand, and some not so great things though.<br /><br />We'll start with the good.  This tuna smelled so fantastic that I was half tempted to take a nibble myself.  You could tell they used quality fish and judging by their packaging, they were smart in their harvesting of the fish too.  Its got the dolphin safe logo and the eco-safe sustainable fishing stamp as well.  They go on to say that they take a break four months out of the year so that the fishing population remains intact.  I'd say that's a pretty good way of doing things.  Its also advertised as a natural product.  So that's pretty cool in a earth safe kind of way.  The only ingredients are tuna (wild caught) and water so that's impressive as well with all the additives even being added to pet food anymore.<br /><br />Since I gave all the cats in the household (and that is again 5 between my mother and I) I was able to see the reaction of many different types of ""personalities"" to this food.  The one that doesn't think she's allowed to eat in front of us, went straight for it and started nibbling, but then snubbed her nose.  The old senile cat immediately ate it and then started eating the blanket she was laying on thinking there was more.  The bully cat ate one piece and then looked broken hearted when the smallest cat (who bullies the ""bully"" cat) hoarded the rest of the food.  That just left the one other cat who gobbled it up while meowing her pleasure and then started looking for more.  Overall it was pretty successful.<br /><br />Now on to the not so good things.  My first complaint with this product would be the packaging.  Upon opening I immediately got squirted with tuna water and had to go change my shirt as I didn't want the cats trying to eat me (and you know the old senile one would try).  The plastic was tough to rip at the seals and that could have accounted for some of the problems, but it also didn't have much of a lip for pulling apart either.  Next problem was the size of these things.  It came in three large slabs and I used one slab and broke it apart for all five cats to share as a treat.  And they still got plenty that way.  I'm not sure what they're thinking when they call this food a ""treat.""  And since there's only three slabs, I'm going to get honest here and say that for the price, you could buy quite a few cans of tuna packed in water and have essentially the same thing as what came in this package.  Even if you bought them at whole foods you could probably get three cans for the same price.  So I'm not sure if this is quite a deal even if it is a eco-friendly product.<br /><br />The cats liked it though and if I were feeling in a generous mood I might get it for them again. It just wouldn't be a regularly scheduled treat.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011",Grilled Tuna Treats by Petite Cuisine,3

"I have to admit, that Glico sometimes have made some exceptional snacks with their Pocky range, such as their Pocky Strawberry, which is a blast. With this milk chocolate version, I was not so impressed.<br /><br />The idea is the same: pretzel stick dipped in chocolate. It is not as sweet as some, so those who do not like sugar-induced psychosis will appreciate these snacks.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is ok, but I found myself rather quickly bored with them. Other varieties of Pocky were much more interesting. Having said that, they make a great reading snack, as they do not leave your fingers covered in garbage, and your pages stay clean.<br /><br />Not a bad snack, but a little boring for me.",Better Pocky Around,3

"I love the concept of a mixture in a small packet form that you can add to water in order to transform the taste. I know many companies have embraced this idea and have branched out from juices to coffee and I think it is a good direction to take. A few of these packets in the side pocket of my bag provides a convenient way to have my own beverage when I want it without the danger of a flask or a bottle spilling on your stuff.<br />This concept I give 5 stars and will gladly purchase more in the future.<br />However, as far as taste goes Lipton has sold out to the sugary sweet guys. Lipton's Iced Green Tea Mix really is more like Kool-Aid fruit punch. For my tasting preference, a 20 oz bottle of water is not enough water for one of these packets. I ended up using half of a packet for 20 oz of water. Using more water with the packet brings out the tea in the drink which is normally hidden by the sugar sweetness in the 20oz water.<br />If Lipton calms down the sweetness level in the packet I would definitely purchase again. It isn't very practical to use only half of the package per beverage.",More like Kool-Aid than tea,3

". . .but when you get to the middle of the bag, all the larger pieces are gone and all you're left with are small pieces of dog food, even pebbles.  The food at the top of the bag contains larger, ""fluffier"" pieces of dog food that look very appetizing, and when these pieces fill our dogs dish, she eats the food rather quickly.  But as the bag is emptied and you get to the middle and bottom of the bag, all those larger pieces are gone and all that's left are small round pebble-like pieces of dog food, that my dog usually lets sit in her dish for a while.  Shaking up the bag, or mixing it up could help, but it would be nice to see an even consistency to the food, rather than having all the ""good stuff"" at the top, with crumbs and pebbles at the bottom.  I also don't think the food is very nutritious or filling, as our dog is always looking for more food or appears hungry after eating this. We seemed to go through the bag rather quickly, even though it was a large bag.  Perhaps this is meant to be mixed with regular dog food or only as an occasional ""treat"" and not part of a dogs regular diet.  In my opinion, it's not worth the extra cost if my dog doesnt appears satisfied after eating, which she rarely did with this food.",Looks Good Near the Top . .,3

"This is a strong iced coffee drink in a small can.  The coffee is light to moderate in acidity, clean tasting,with a medium level of bitterness, quite strong and quite rich.  There is no milk or cream in it.  There is a little sugar which gives the drink a moderate level of sweetness that is good and appropriate.  Drinking it straight, the taste is a little too lean and austere.  I prefer iced coffee to have a little dairy for roundness and body.  Coffee of this strength alone leaves too dry a taste and lacking in richness.  That aside, I added a small scoop of vanilla ice cream to this drink and it tasted very nice.  It has all the missing parts filled in as far as I am concerned.  Most bottled ice coffee drinks with cream are too sweet.  This one isn't.  It just needs a bit of roundness from the ice cream (half-and-half will do similarly).  Overall, it is an ok drink.  From a can though, if you have no access to milk or cream, this drink may be a bit too strong and too dry to have broad appeal.",ok,3

"Let me start by saying I really like these snacks. I've not tried the salt or cocoa flavors, but the pepper and salt taste very good. Very nutty with just the right amount of black pepper bite. These snacks are derived mostly from wheat and sunflower seeds with some sesame seeds. In addition to the black pepper flavor there is a slight hint of jalapeno and even less of garlic. While these are a great alternative to peanuts, they are not a low fat or low caloric snack. Each piece, or cracker, is about 10 calories and a serving has 10% of your RDA of sodium. Indeed, they taste very salty and suspiciously are difficult to stop eating.<br /><br />If I like Somersaults so much, why just 3 stars? If you look at the ingredients it seems odd that a high sodium snack has salt as its last ingredient. In fact, modified food starch comes before salt. Where is the rest of the sodium coming from? Look closely at the ""seasonings."" In parentheses the seasonings used in the snack are listed in order of abundance. The very first ""seasoning"" is ""spices"" and the second seasoning is ""yeast extract."" Yeast extract is an analog for MSG (processed free glutamic acid). In short, the sodium is mostly coming from a form of MSG. Please be careful eating these if you are sensitive to MSG.<br /><br />So what do we have here? A tasty snack that contains too much sodium and has a flavor enhancer derived from a form of MSG. I still really really like these snacks and I will continue to buy them, but with so much sodium and the use of yeast extract I can't rate these any higher. Note that this company is not by any means alone is labeling something as ""all natural"" while using a form of MSG.",I really like these; nutty snacks,3

I bought these without a review and without much information about what type I was buying -- I guess I'm a maverick like that (ha). Although I got them on time, and had apparently purchased an espresso that was considered 4 out of 5 in strength, it really tasted like a 1.5 out of 5 in strength. So, I'm NOT impressed with the coffee -- and I am NOT a coffee expert.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I might try them again if I can find out which espresso is strongest. And, I might try them again because I hate the planet-hating, overpriced monopoly that Nestle has on Nespresso pods... but I gotta say that Nestle's Nespresso pods are tastier.<br /><br />So would some entrepreneur mind doing something about this dilemma?

"I looked at the other reviews for this drink, noticed that many said the ginger was way strong. I thought ""Well, I really like ginger, so it'll be ok."" But, really, it's STRONG. Mixing with the instructed 240ml (1 cup) of water leaves a very gingery drink. However, diluting it with about another half-cup of water brought the ginger down to a nice level. At this point it was just SWEET, like ginger tea with 2 packets of Splenda. Way too sweet for me.<br />The lemon is of course overpowered by the ginger. This wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />The one thing I really did like was drinking it with a sore throat. Swollen, aching throat loves ginger, lemon, and hot beverages in general. The Gold Kili drink felt quite nice on my throat and I didn't mind the sweetness or strength of the ginger as much as I probably would normally.<br />Also, it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor. By the time I was almost finished it didn't seem nearly as strong.<br /><br />Coming upon a packet of this, I wouldn't turn it down, but I probably wouldn't buy it. I'd much rather just get tea, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG87Q"">Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea</a>, and sweeten it with honey myself.",VERY Strong... but feels good on sore throat,3

It's a more acidic bean than I like.<br /><br />I prefer the Lavazza Tierra blend, it's oilier and its aroma is less herbal and more chocolaty. It's less acidic as well.<br /><br />All that being said, I tried buying Lavazza on Amazon to get the free prime shipping, but it's not worth it.

"I looked these Halo pumpkin dental chews up on Amazon to see reviews.  I also read the ingredients on them, and found they were wholesome good food products that I would want my dogs eating.<br />  I went by my local animal food store and bought two of these chews for the 25-60Lb size.  One was for my 20lb jack russell who is an avid chewer and the other was for my 40lb aussie/heeler.  Great ingredients.  Since this size has 85 calories a piece, I needed to give only half to the jack.  I gave the jack the half one and the aussie the full one.  Wow, were they hard.  Problem was my jack wanted the whole thing in his mouth while he tried to chew pieces off which he couldn't really.  So I thought uhoh I better get the rest away from him but if he thinks I am coming to take it he will gulp it.  So I distracted him with squirt cheese and took half of the half away.  The aussie promptly gulped the rest of hers fearing I was going after hers too.  So where these were great that they were hard so they actually had to chew on them, maybe not for gulpers.  The dogs seemed very happy with the taste and smell.",Very hard product,3

"I am definitely in the middle of the fence regarding this product. :-(<br /><br />The good:<br />* Non-BPA packaging (as we all know, almost impossible to find for a plain tomato product)<br />* low in sodium<br />* not sourced in China<br /><br />Now for what I consider the downsides (other than the price, which may not be a deterrent to some).<br /><br />First, compared to the no-salt-added product I used to use (Del Monte Petite Cut Tomatoes, No Salt Added), I do think these tomatoes have FAR less taste. The difference is not due to salt content because the sodium content as given on the packaging of both products is the same. IMHO the Pomi tomatoes taste less ""tomato-y"" than what I used to buy (a friend who also tried the Pomi said she finds the taste ""insipid""). But that is not my main gripe.<br /><br />The package claims 26 1/2 oz net weight (approximately, but close enough). However, a LOT of that weight is the watery juice from the tomatoes and thus I was unpleasantly surprised to see how little of that 26.46 oz is actually TOMATOES. So one day I took the time to strain the package and see exactly how much chopped tomato there is, versus their juice. The strained chopped tomato pieces were weighed on my electronic kitchen scale and came to 13.4 oz; the juice which was strained directly into a measuring cup came to just below the 11 fluid oz mark. Also, some of that 13.4 oz of chopped tomatoes also included a little bit of juice as well, since they were impossible to drain completely ""dry"". So this means that for the current price ($2.50 per box of Pomi at my local supermarkets) you are getting only about 13 oz of chopped tomatoes. That comes to about 19 cents per ounce. Hmmmmmm.<br /><br />This made me curious enough to invest in a ""throwaway"" can of my former choice, the Del Monte Petite Cut tomatoes which comes in a 14.5 oz can, to see how they compared. I strained it in the same manner as I did the Pomi. The results: I got 12 oz of actual tomatoes and only 2.5 oz of their juices. The can of Del Monte was $1.29 (at the same large supermarket chain that sells the Pomi for $2.50) which comes to 10.7 cents per ounce... almost half the cost of the Pomi if you are calculating how much actual chopped tomatoes you get for the money.<br /><br />I must also comment that the consistency of the Pomi chopped tomatoes is much ""mushier"" than the Del Monte petite cut or other typical canned ones ... in fact, IMHO the Pomi chopped is more than halfway to ""sauce"" consistency right out of the box, which is okay for some recipes but not good for others. The Del Monte diced served me perfectly in that regard but again... that darned BPA in their cans! :-(<br /><br />I really DID want to love the Pomi chopped tomatoes and if it was only the taste and the consistency that disappointed, I could probably learn to live with those shortcomings. However the realization that they cost almost twice the price for approximately the same quantity of ACTUAL chopped tomatoes compared to the equivalent canned product, is very frustrating especially in today's economy. Because I usually need little or none of the juice which makes up more than 35% of the package's contents, basically I'm paying a 90% premium for the non-BPA packaging.<br /><br />There should really be a better alternative but I've yet to find it. The few tomatoes in glass jars that I have found, have all contained spices (which I can't use, being allergic to garlic and onion) or have high sodium contents. Ideally, I wish Pomi would add a straining step to this product (which perhaps Del Monte does?) so that their package would contain more tomatoes and less liquid.","I wanted to love everything about these, BUT...",3

"The price on this product was quite good.  I was aware before I bought it that it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, which I avoid like the plague because it increases one's triglycerides.  But then so does honey.

"UPDATE 11/17/2011:<br /><br />I'm dropping my rating to 3 stars. After months on this food with great results, our smaller cat started gradually losing the weight he'd gained when we switched to it, losing appetite, vomiting, and even refusing to eat. This prompted a trip to the vet, and as she's suggested that although EVO is very high quality food, the protein content is too high even for many cats. She did a kidney examination and checked for other signs of renal failure (thankfully none). Her feedback was that EVO is hit/miss from cat to cat, and when her clinic used to sell EVO they had many customers complaining of cats vomiting.<br /><br />It still seems to have worked wonders with my bigger fatter cat, but with the little guy it just upsets his stomach too much. I'd probably only switch to this food by a vet's recommendation.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />In my quest to buy more things online and save money I started looking at cat food and investigating what really makes good cat food. The two big discoveries were (I am not a vet):<br /><br />1. Cats are obligate carnivores. They are designed to essentially eat nothing but meat.<br />2. Dry cat food is often made of mostly grains in order to get the moisture level down to make them shelf stable.<br /><br />These two things are at odds with each other. A carb heavy diet is not easily processed by house cats, may not<br /><br />have enough protein, and can be tough on their kidneys. If you've read the other reviews here for this cat food, you know that it's highly recommended for cats with renal (kidney) failure, and there are some miracle stories of diabetic cats no longer needing insulin shots after changing to this food.<br /><br />The EVO dry food uses some patented process that I don't understand, but I can only imagine it involves a combination of wizards and magnets. The end result is a dry, shelf stable food that has much more protein than other dry cat foods, with fewer grains/carbohydrates.<br /><br />Both of our cats were healthy, but one was a bit on the skinny side, and the other was fat and lazy. Within weeks of changing over to this food, the fat/lazy one has noticeably more energy. His weight fluctuates a lot so it's a bit early to say if this has had an effect. The skinny one has definitely filled out and looks much healthier. He rarely begged for food before, but he does now.<br /><br />The food turned out to be more expensive than the Nutro stuff I was feeding them before, but given the immediately visible change in our cats I feel pretty comfortable saying that this food is healthier, and might extend their lives. If it prevents my fat cat from becoming diabetic, I'd say a few hundred bucks over the next ten or so years is well worth it.",Obvious improvement in our cats' health,3
"I gave this product 3 stars  because depending on the type it is a full 5 stars or only 1 star.<br /><br />The herb kit grew quick.  My cilantro seeds didn't grow but they do have a warranty for that.  The herbs grew like crazy although keep the basil trimmed or it will smother everything else.  The choice of herbs is a little odd but they all grow really well together.<br /><br />The cherry tomato kit was horrible.  It's a lot of work to try and get them to grow right and I've only had 1 tomato ever grow.  The stalks want to grow tall but without anything to support them they start toppling over.  Overall, way too much work to be worth it.  It's easier to grow tomatoes in a pot!",Some are great some are really bad,3
"I thought I would give these jelly beans a try after seeing numerous ads in my running/health magazines.  I thought, hey I love jelly beans why not give it a go.  I have used cliff shots, GU, power bars, almost every kind of endurance treats out there.  This was my latest trial.  They were not the best but they were not terrible.  I did notice a bit of a late run boost, but the taste is medicore at best.  I thought I was trying to swallow vitamins.  If taken without water beware of a gagging sensation.  However, I have a very sensitive stomach and low tolerance when I am distance running, so that might be the reason.  If you think they will taste like jelly beans beware, they do not.

I tried a can of crab from the grocery store that was $4 a can. All is was was particles of crab meat kind of like coffee grinds out of a used coffee filter. It really didn't have a flavor to it. I ended up just putting it on some lettuce with ranch and ate it like a salad. I will never buy it again.<br /><br />But I really love crab meat and sushi but I can't really afford it nor do I have the time to dine out much. So I'm looking for some type of substitute for fresh seafood even though I know it won't be nearly as good so I have extremely low expectations.<br /><br />This was more like shredded crab mixed with particles of crab meat BUT there were a few thicker pieces in there like maybe from the leg of a very tiny crab. So it was better than the grocery store kind I tried and cheaper. BUT this brand had pieces of shell in it--the other did not. This one had sugar added to it so it tasted sweet which makes no sense to me.<br /><br />So I might possibly try this again knowing full well I'd do better just going to a Chinese buffet since that's the closet I will get to fresh crab in Appalachia. It's not something I will buy reguarly. Maybe once a month or every couple months. It's cheap. It somewhat has a crab taste if you use your imagination. It basically tastes like tuna.<br /><br />I will save up some money and try lump crab meat in a can next. Wish me luck.,Sweet taste and shell bits (See customer image I uploaded),3

"Since I love French Roast, I was happy to get a sample of this particular roast. I opened the sealed bag and smelled the contents, which were not as robust-smelling as the French Roast I have been used to. I brewed a cup, and tasted it:<br /><br />1) Black no sugar -- rubbery after-taste<br />2) Black, with sugar -- mitigated the rubbery after-taste which was still there<br />3) Cream and sugar -- removed the rubbery after-taste, was pleasant and smooth but not as rich and aromatic as the French Roast I am used to.<br /><br />After four cups (not in the same day) my stomach WAS happier than when on ""normal"" coffee - I determined that the rubbery after-taste was there to stay. However, the coffee WAS smooth and definitely not acidic. But, it's a sad trade-off: low acid, rubbery taste (unless you mask it with cream/soy and sugar/honey). Hopefully something can be done to ""tweak"" those ""settings"".","Smooth, but with a bitter after-taste",3
"I do not suffer from heart-burn or other stomach ills that are related to acidity of my food. I am an average coffee drinker.  I don't have to drink decaffinated coffee, and I don't make a point of drinking only gourmet coffee either.<br /><br />This coffee claims to be the answer for the needs of those who are acid-sensitive.  I can see why, because I can taste the low acidity.  It adds a certain degree of smoothness and drinkability.  The aroma is good, it is inviting, and the after taste is quite pleasent.  Even though I don't have to drink low-acid coffee, I could drink this coffee daily, and I could be content.<br /><br />Then, there is the other side of the coin.  If you are a true gourmet coffee drinker, you probably will be very disappointed with this one.  If you are happy with the ""house-blend"" at ""Starbucks"", you will likely be happy with this one too.  If you only drink some of the specialty brands of coffee from ""Peets"", then you should not even consider buying this one.<br /><br />Finally there is the price.  I am accustomed to pay this kind of price for top of the line gourmet coffee, but I consider it on the high side for this kind of product.","This could be god-sent or ""donau-wasser"" depending on who you are",3

"These lamb and barley treats have some excellent features. I was impressed the certified organic ingredients, the re-sealable bag, and I like that they are large bones, but are scored so they can be broken in half. Left whole, the treats are good for large dogs, but when broken in half would be good for medium-sized dogs. They seem a bit too hard for small dogs.<br /><br />Our dogs usually like lamb flavored food, so this seemed like a good choice. We have three dogs and each had their own reaction to the treat. Our smallest dog, who usually likes anything, would barely sniff the treat and didn't even try to eat it. The middle-sized dog who is more picky wouldn't eat it at first. After playing with it for a few minutes, he finally did eat it. I'm assuming the smell wasn't appealing to him since it doesn't smell like a typical dog treat. Our dogs are used to a variety of store-bought and homemade dog treats. However, these organic treats smelled like hay to me (I'm assuming that's the barley), and therefore weren't very well received by two of my dogs.<br /><br />Our Golden Retriever likes most any treats and she ate this one without hesitation. While the treats might be great for some, since only one of our dogs will eat the treats regularly, I don't think they would be worth the extra cost for our household.","Healthy, organic ingredients...but mixed review on flavor",3

"I have to admit I was a little surprised by the product.  Normally ""treats"" are of the dry variety while this was more strips of something closer to canned food - although quite solid.  The packaging was a bit of a pain to open but once done I placed some down for my two cats.  One thought it was the greatest idea ever while the other ignored it completely.  The same thing happened with the same cats in repeated tries.  This should not be a surprise to most cat owners:  they are notoriously finicky eaters.  The problem is the price point is rather steep for something they might not even like.  I would give it a shot if you have multiple felines as at least one will problably go for it.  But then, there may be treats far less expensive they will eat with equal zeal.",It All Depends ...,3

"As a fan of Stash Lemon-Ginger tea, this Gold kili product seemed promising.  I received a single packet to try in with one 8 oz. (250ml) cup of hot water from the Vine program.  So this commentary is from a single usage.  The ingredients are: Ginger, Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose) and Natural Lemon Flavor.<br />Given that I regularly drink tea and in fact Stash Ginger-Lemon tea;  I'm used to sweetener as optional and not included. I didn't like this aspect of this product as for the most part, I never add sugar to any beverage.  But, I wanted to keep an open mind.<br /><br />The product mixed up easily with hot water and was a cloudy yellow-orange. It was not as dark as the one shown in the product page.  The ginger was strong (which I like) and the lemon astringent (so-so).  I found that odd, as usually sugar balances the overall bitterness of lemon. However overall it had a pleasant taste and you ended up with a little burn in your mouth due to the ginger at the end.<br /><br />I think I would purchase this if it did not have honey in it, as a reasonable substitution for the Stash tea. Mind you, this product costs twice as much.",A nice bite and pleasant taste,3

The price makes it a deal breaker, I just ordered more to add to my collection of different varieties of coffee.

After using this for several weeks, I will have to agree that this is not up to snuff with regular K-Cups---I don't think it's as bad as some think but is not as good as the regular ground coffee.

"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",Cats love it -- but I am concerned,3

"First of all let me state that I love my Aerogarden.  HOwever, there were some issues with the herb kit.  For one thing, I think it's sort of impossible to grow a reasonable amount of each herb in such a tiny space under fluorescent lighting.  IF I grew this again (which I won't) there are certainly some things I'd do differently.  The manual advised not to thin the plants when they sprouted--mistake #1, especially for the basil--one basil took off and shaded the others, which were never able to catch up.  My purple basil and chives grew pathetically.  In fact, the entire time I grew this kit the chives had maybe four sad little stems.  Flavor left a little to be desired as well, especially for the dill.  Barely three months after planting, my herb garden virtually self-destructed.  This I blame on the fact that the company advises you to just keep throwing nutrient tablets in every two weeks, never rinsing out the bowl to keep the salts from becoming too concentrated/imbalanced.  Flushing the system is just basic maintenance with hydroponics!  In my bigger hydroponic garden, I have lettuces that are still going strong after four+ months, so there's no reason this should've burnt itself out so soon.  I think it's a bit of a deception on the part of Aerogrow; properly maintaining the garden would extend it's life greatly and you wouldn't be coming back to buy a new seed kit so soon.  But I was willing to let my herb garden go so I could try the cherry tomatoes.  So far so good with that kit, they are just now getting ready to bloom and I have high hopes for what seem to be very healthy looking tomato plants.  Next time though, I'll probably just buy the master gardener's kit, which gives you everything you need for one year's growth, except seeds, for $40.00.  I have amassed quite the seed collection, so I really don't need any more overpriced seed kits.  Plus, isn't it a lot more fun to experiment on your own instead of following the instructions in a manual?  Like I said, I love my Aerogarden, but sometimes it's a little too ""idiot proof.""  EDIT:  Having grown the tomatoes to completion, I can't recommend that kit either.  I didn't get very many tomatoes.  The ones I got tasted pretty much just like grocery store cherry 'matoes, so okay, but this was more of a novelty than an actual productive tomato garden.  Also, even though I pruned the plants at 5 weeks to make them stronger, they were in need of support.  I tried to tie them to the lamp arm as suggested in the manual, but the angle is all wrong; it doesn't help at all!  One of my plants fell over and died anyway, still loaded with it's meager crop of 8-10 underripe tomatoes.  I think you need more vertical space, a stronger light source, and some sort of growing medium to give tomatoes the support they need.  That said, I STILL LOVE THE AEROGARDEN!  It's cool, and I'm not giving up on it yet.  I just know it's perfect for something, but I haven't found the right plant yet.",Meh...,3

"My boston loves this toy!  It keeps her busy for quite a while and she's a heavy chewer, so it held up... for a while.  Like others, she has managed to chew her way through the rubber rope that comes out the end, but only a little at a time.  I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!

"I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors, but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor.","so-so flavor, too much fiber for me",3

It can be found in smaller packages at most supermarkets in America. All PG Tips products seem to be reasonably priced.<br /><br />The Bad: I personally do not like the flavor.

"This review is based on my impression of the Newman's dog treats, and the reaction of my two dogs. The variables:<br /><br />1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.<br />2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.<br />3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts.<br />4) When they are given a ""treat,"" it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.<br /><br />I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.<br /><br />I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, ""you're not getting anything else for a treat,"" and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don't wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBIP5W"">Milk-Bone Biscuits for Small Dogs</a>.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a texture issue?

If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great - they still make a decent drink.","Not bad, just not great.",3

"I have occasional problems with heartburn, so when I saw that Puroast had released a coffee specially designed to be low acid, I was eager to try it, and I enlisted my husband as a willing co-investigator.  Our verdict:  The coffee does indeed have a noticeably smoother, less acidy taste.  That's the good part.  However, I would characterize the taste--and I'm trying to be diplomatic here--as reminiscent of a slightly old coffee foil pack found in a three star hotel.  I'll admit to being somewhat of a Starbucks addict, and I don't think the Puroast will convince me to change.  However, I think it would be a good option to have on hand for times when my stomach is acting up but I still need my morning caffeine fix, and if my stomach forced me to where I had to choose between the Puroast low acid coffee or no coffee at all, I'd gratefully drink the Puroast.",Nice if your stomach needs the low acidity,3

"The ChocoPerfection ""Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Bars"" are indeed good tasting, but did cause me to experience some fairly spectacular ""gastric distress"". I bought a box of these when they came up on Woot and was excited about getting a Maltitol free, diabetic friendly chocolate bar with only 2 net carbs.<br /><br />While I knew that Maltitol caused me gastric issues, I thought these would be safe since Erythritol is OK for me and ate one before heading out of the house. Sadly I suspect the Oligofructose brought on a very unpleasant reaction that was more than a little embarrassing since it occurred at very public event. Further tests in privacy of my home confirmed that these bars were the cause of the unpleasantness.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor and low-carb count, but make sure you know if they will ""effect"" you before heading out to enclosed places with a lot of people. Ironically, my non-diabetic son doesn't have a reaction to these and enjoys the taste so at least they won't go to waste.<br /><br />CFH","Good Tasting, But Can Cause Gastric Distress",3

We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.,Popcorn,3

"Here's what it says over the label-  Total Carbs 41, Fiber -5, Protected Carbs -31 = digestible carbs 5<br /><br />Now, what the hell are ""protected carbs""?  No one knows.  This is a term that the company coined themselves.  And they don't really give any explaination either.  When you go on their website they claim that these ""protected carbs"" are not digestible.  Really?  Well then why don't you go ahead and tell us what exactly they are then?<br /><br />I asked 2 nutritionists about this and they both told me that they are familiar with Dreamfields Pasta and both stated it is a scam that uses tricky wording on their labels!  One nutritionist told me that her patients would have no insulin spike but then 4 hours after eating the pasta suddenly it would spike drastically.  She believes all this pasta does is slow the digestion to a point where it tricks people for a few hours into thinking they are taking in only 5 carbs.  Both doctors said that the real net carb content of this pasta is actually around 36.  Which is still less than other pastas, but not by much.  I eat this pasta as I am not diabetic and it does taste good and have less carbs, but I have diabetic relatives and I would never cook it for them.  When I'm done with the dreamfields I have left over I'm going to try Carba-Nada pasta...which isn't really low carb, but it's lower than Dreamfields and they don't have tricky nutrition labels.  Haven't tried it yet though so I can't comment on it any more than that.","very sneaky people- HARDLY LOW CARB, but less carbs than regular pasta",3

"I'm not rating this because I've had this particular product, but I've had octopus before in a can and it was just the arms and they were very small and skinny. It was in olive oil and it tasted to me like sardines which I like. I didn't know a whole octopi is sold. There's only a picture and no real product description. Wish I had the bucks because I'd buy this and there are directions online how to cook a whole one. You can boil them, you can deep fry pre-cooked octopus, you can saute pre-cooked octopus and you can pickle them. Just look up how to eat 'em. I don't even know if the canned octopus I had was pre-cooked.<br /><br />I personally adore octopi as a species. They're super smart and they're not the crazed sea monsters horror movies make them out to be. Some are quite shy in the wild while others are just as curious about you. I've seen documentaries where the octopus is having a field day exploring the diver, then swims away.  I've seen an angry one and I've seen a scared one. All they do is just change color and I think there's only one octopus that's poisonious but it has blue rings on it as a warning. But of course I wouldn't want to be a hapless crab then it'd be lights out for good.<br /><br />And to that first reviewer, they're not legs, they're arms and you'd be squishy too if you had no bones. Octopi don't have a single bone in their bodies and they're not mean at all. Wouldn't know about giant squid though because no one has ever found one alive.<br /><br />I'd eat an octopus any time as long as it's dead. Eating a live one can get caught in your throat and you suffocate. Now that is the stuff of nightmares.&lt;g>",Octopus snack,3

"I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon. So, while people like this mix- 99+ people have not (yet) rated this item.","Good texture, flat flavor",3

"The ingredients on this item show several natural fruit juices, but the first one on the list is apple, followed by grape.  Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.  I know this is actually fairly common in beverages that have multiple tastes...apple and grape become the ""base"" and other juices are added in moderation to create a convincing flavor in which the taste of the apple and/or grape fades to the background.<br /><br />Not so in this case of the Kiwi Berry Switch.  It tasted, to me, like apple juice with sparkling water added.  This in not a BAD thing...I kind of like that taste (having spent many years in Germany, the ""Apfelschorle"" (sparkling apple juice) is a commonly served drink which I always enjoyed.  HOWEVER, I was expecting something that tasted like Kiwi Berry...and in this I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's nice that SWITCH makes these sodes without any corn syrup or other additives...just juice and carbonated water.  They're still high in calories and sugar content though...so it's not exactly a health drink.  And I wouldn't say it's worth paying more than I would for another ""regular"" soda.<br /><br />It's a refreshing drink, but I can only give it the most lukewarm recommendation because it doesn't taste like what the can promises, and offers only modest ""health"" reasons, none of which really justify a higher price.",Tastes more like Carbonated apple juice,3

"As sugar-free gums go, this gum is awful.  The taste dissipates in no time, and the gum itself is far from elastic.<br /><br />Yet I still buy it.  Why?  Because it uses only XYLITOL as its sweetener, a substance that actually reverses tooth decay (minor reversal, mind you, but, well... I'll take anything).  It's actually GOOD for teeth.<br /><br />Other gums on the market that taste better have XYLITOL as an ingredient, but they also include other sugar-free sweeteners.<br /><br />Here's what Wikiipedia says about XYLITOL:  ""Xylitol is a 'toothfriendly' sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries. Recent research[7] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then ""starves"" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption.""<br /><br />On top of all this, XYLITOL might actually improve bone density.<br /><br />Taste?

"This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice. These probably  make up at least 80 to 90% of this juice by volume. The juice is a pleasant mild red or pink blush color. The mild kiwi and berry flavor appears almost as a pleasant aftertaste rather than the dominant flavor note.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this has a pleasant but not outstanding flavor. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion (""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.","Apple, Grape and a touch of Kiwi-Berry",3
"This was one of the first bread mixes I tried after learning I couldn't tolerate gluten.  Fresh out of the oven it is amazing to eat with just some butter/jam on it.  It even smelled like real bread when baking and was just incredibly yummy freshly baked.  I could have eaten the entire life, haha!  But I found the next day it was not as good, even with retoasting it in the oven.  It was very heavy and dense and had a strange bitter taste to it.  Because of the dense texture though I think this would work really well for sweet breads.  I tried using it as a pizza crust and it was just way too heavy and overpowering of more delicate flavors like cheese and mushrooms.  The flours used in this were a little hard on my tummy too.  Overall it is okay, but I am not amazed.  I would probably skip this unless I plan to use the whole loaf fresh from baking or just for sweet breads.",Really good when fresh,3

"I should have known when the box said ""cheesy skillets"" and had Velveeta as an ingredient that this wasn't probably for me. It did take the 20 minutes to prepare the Chicken and Broccoli <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80OE"">Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, 14.64-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> meal. I had precooked the chicken, so I am not including the chicken cooking time as part of the 20 minutes.<br /><br />The instructions are clear enough - cook the chicken, cook the pasta, add the broccoli and the cheese. I may have misunderstood the directions because I didn't put the broccoli in until after the pasta was cooked. The water cooked off very quickly, in about 5 minutes for me. I did have the skillet on simmer, so I don't know if this is my problem or the instructions problems. I had to add about 3/4 of a cup more of water to finish cooking the pasta and the broccoli. The broccoli florets were about the size of parsley flakes, so if you are not fond of broccoli, this is a plus for you. I happen to like broccoli. And than you pour the small packet of Velveeta on top of the food. For me, it was too much Velveeta - it could have been decreased by 1/3 and I think it would make a better tasting meal - especially with the addition of more broccoli.<br /><br />For me, I just wasn't that impressed with it. I would have like more broccoli and less cheese.  However, if my picky sons were still at home, I think they would have loved it. Not enough broccoli for them to whine about eating and of course, the Velveeta cheese they love.<br />I would recommend this to somebody who really, really liked Velveeta. It might a good kid's dinner for some folks. But for me, thanks but no thanks.",too much cheese....,3

From the reviews I was expecting the quality and taste of the movie theater's popcorn.  It wasn't so with this product unfortunately.  If you don't put salt on the popcorn there's no flavor at all.  I use the coconut popcorn oil and popcorn salt but cannot tell any difference with or without this product.  I asked several local theaters what they really use (and not what this product's makers claim) and they told me they melt Promise margarine for their corn.  Much tastier and a lot less money.  This product is mostly palm and some other kind of oil with artificial butter flavoring that looses its taste on the hot popcorn.  I really did want to like this product and even purchased 2 based on the comments but both are bland and useless (except adding more oil to the popcorn).  I gave it 3 stars because I didn't want to seem like a negatron.,NO TASTE,3

"Now I have to give this product a 3, because yes it works, but there were some complications. I did not notice a difference right away like some mothers. It was about 3 days after taking 3 capsules 3x a day that i had an increase in my supply. I was able to pump about 2 oz after each feeding prior  to taking the fenugreek, then it increased to about 6 oz after each feeding (i was storing for returning to work) About the time I started getting a result, my son was getting the side effects of horrible tummy pains. It made him constipated to where he didn't have a bm for 7 days, and he stayed up for almost 20 hrs straight screaming at one point. (he was about 2 months old and a very happy baby normally.) For this reason I had to discontinue use. I would recomend it for mothers who are having issues with their milk supply, because this is not the case for all babies, and the product works, but i would recomend discontinuing use at the first sign of a gassy fussy baby because it takes several days to get baby comfortable again once it starts- I got NO sleep for 4 days in a row.... yuck.",No sleep for me :(,3

"Just returned an unopened bag to local pet supplier who kindly took it back.<br /><br />A couple of our cats seem to like it at first, but soon lost interest in it for some odd reason.

"Certainly a great British tea product. Traditionally, such products come to the customers with at least one to two years for shelf life freshness. This end-of-the-2009-year purchase (six big boxes!) provided me with the product expiring in June 2010.

"I've tried a bunch of different peanut butter brands like Skippy and Jif, as well as own-store brands.

"I read many of the reviews on this product before deciding to give it a try myself. I enjoy both lemon and ginger, so I thought there would be a fair chance that I would like this beverage.  I decided to have it one afternoon instead of a cup of coffee and here are my thoughts. It smelled very good after the hot water was added, I used 8-9 ounces.  On my first sip I was overwhelmed by the ginger. Obviously I expected ginger and lemon, but I was hoping that they would be in equal parts so that one didn't overpower the other; this was not the case. I continued to drink it, but after about a 1/4 of the cup I couldn't go on. I thought maybe if I diluted it a bit more that it would be okay, but while this lessened the ginger it made the lemon barely noticeable.

"This product does not disolve easy with just stiring, I threw mine into the blender to get it mixed well. I would highly recommend anybody interested in this product should go to their local healthfood store and buy the individual packets first. These packets are single servings of the product and sell for a dollar something, this is a good way to try the product out to see if it suits your family without wasting a ton of money. This is what my husband and I did, we bought two of the chocolate flavor and one of the berry flavor and have tried both out on my preschooler. She didn't seem found of either of them, the choclate has a very light chocolate flavor and it had an overpowering after taste of the greens. The berry was just way to sweet I've read people compare it to koolaid and that would be about right if you like your koolaid with 2 extra cups of sugar in it. I have used the second chocolate packet in a breakfast smoothie for her with bananas and peanut butter and that seemed to get ride of the after taste and she seemed to enjoy it.If you don't mind being creative and doing a little extra work to mask the flavor of the greens this product could be a healthy addtition to your childs diet.",It's ok,3

"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.",Mixed feelings,3

"I purchased two bottles of this stuff. The capsules of one bottle were dark and the capsules of the other bottle (which I started on yesterday) are a light brown color and I can clearly see the movement of the fluid inside the capsule. With the first bottle, I did not notice an increase in my supply and although I've only been using the second bottle for a day, I came home from work on my break and pumped 4.5 oz in ten minutes. I am usually only able to pump 3oz in ten minutes. I haven't changed anything in my diet to explain this sudden increase so I do believe it was the use of the new pills.<br /><br />I think the first bottle may have been older and so the capsules may have lost their potency. That is the only theory I have to explain the dark color and my inability to see the fluid in the capsule. I guess just be careful with this stuff.

"Okay, it is a good rice. Tilda Basmati is a completely fantastic rice if separate rice grains are an important thing to you.<br /><br />I should say that I purchased a Zojirushi NS-LAC05 rice cooker. If you want rice to make a difference, buy a really good rice cooker. Rice does not have to be a filler substance.<br /><br />Tilda Basmati Rice has extra-super long grains. The grains are so long that many of them curl after being prepared. This is an absolutely superb rice if a fluffy, separate grain rice is of high priority. There is a place for that and I am quite thankful for my purchase for that category of need. Tilda really is a great, high quality rice for common rice needs.<br /><br />Since I got my Zojirushi rice cooker, well, the cooker really brings out the differences in rice. If you just prepare your rice in a saucepan on the stove, it really doesn't matter all that much to buy an upper level quality rice IMHO. No offense to saucepan/stove-top people. Rice is a good and often necessary food item. Stove-top prep is certainly better than not having it. HOWEVER, my Zojirushi rice cooker has really made rice a whole 'nuther deal.<br /><br />And to my point: Tilda Basmati is a really great rice if you want fluffy rice with separate rice grains. Fluffy rice with separate grains is a totally valid category. In fact, it may be what most people want. I feel that my Tilda Basmati is a very high quality rice. My only disappointment is that it is in that extra long grain category and the fact that it produces very separate rice grains, which could be a very positive aspect to many, if not most. I just happen to like rice that sticks together more.<br /><br />I would buy it again in a heartbeat next time I need long grain rice that has very separate grains. Since I purchased a 10-Pound bag, I may not need to buy more for a while.<br /><br />Very highly recommended if you want fluffy rice with separate grains.

"We are very careful about which foods we buy anymore, avoiding anything with grain in it.<br />Cats don't eat grains in their diet on any regular basis, but it is a cheap filler for many<br />manufacturers of pet foods. We found that our male cat gets itchy hot spots is he eats<br />corn or wheat, so we look for things without that.<br /><br />We normally buy Blue Buffalo, but I was looking for another type of healthy food that we could<br />use for their treat balls <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CG40O"">PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball, Blue</a>.<br />(We used to feed them Temptations, which they go crazy for, but also makes our male cat very itchy.)<br /><br />Thought we'd try this. I thought the pea protein was a little weird, but male cat loves peas already,<br />so why not. Chicken is the preferred flavor by both cats (neither of whom like fish flavors. It's really<br />a stereotype that cats and fish are a dream team!), so this should work out well.<br /><br />I should have looked for a smaller bag to give this one a try! Geesh - it's large. I am used to cat foods<br />being packaged in a more verticle-oriented package. This one is large and flat, more like dry dog food<br />packaging.<br /><br />Both cats were very interested as soon as I took it out of the shipping box (of course, they<br />think every box coming in to the house is surely something wonderful for them anyway!).<br />I cut the top open, and fed them a handful. It was inhaled! While I am not overly impressed with the<br />ingredients (they could do a lot better), it isn't the worst by a long shot, and I don't think it will<br />bother either cat. If it does, I'll come back and update my review.<br />Would I buy it again?  Maybe - but right now, I have three gallon-size zipper bags full of it, so it'll be<br />a while! Glad they like it! Otherwise the strays would be eating really well around here! Ha!<br />Not horrible, cats both like it, not full of grain meals, not much smell at all to it, and the pieces<br />are a really nice size/shape for cats. They look like a pencil eraser cut in half horizontally! : )<br /><br />Update as of May 20:  Neither cat is very impressed. They don't really care one way or the other over this one.<br />One kitty has a lot of tummy bloating with it, so not sure what to think, except that this was my first and last purchase<br />of this particular product.

"I like this gum, it gets a 5, but here's my gripe.  For some reason they decided to change the packaging, and the changes are really lame.  This gum used to be packaged in 12 blister packs, each having 12 pieces of gum, each blister pack with a cardboard sleeve.  Now it's 16 blister packs of 9 pieces each, again each with a cardboard sleeve, but two of the sleeved blister packs are stuck together. That's right, way more packaging for the same amount of gum.  The claim is ""now 50% more"" because apparently when you stick two packs with 25% less together, you get 50% more.  Sadly, it's the same 144 pieces of gum, just WAY more packaging.  I hope the marketing agency that convinced Wrigley to do this incredibly stupid, environmentally irresponsible thing is forced to move to a landfill and watch as their offices get inundated by 9 piece blister packs.  The only downside to this scenario is that the process will be a third faster than if they had just left it alone, putting them out of their misery sooner.  By the way, have I mentioned that there's WAY MORE PACKAGING?","Same gum, way more packaging",3

"Like most women, I'm always on the lookout for that next really great beauty product, whether it be a cosmetic, a perfume, or a hair product. One of the basics for me is having healthy, pretty hair. When I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, I was intrigued. The name implies something very basic and healthy without too many chemicals.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it had not been packaged well. Where the conditioner (which was sent in a separate package) had the dispenser taped down and the entire bottle wrapped in plastic, the shampoo was merely wrapped in plastic. Without the tape holding the dispenser closed, the shampoo leaked all in the plastic during shipping. On a good note, the plastic wrapping proved good enough to contain the leakage so that it didn't even touch the cardboard box.<br /><br />When I removed the plastic, I was immediately stunned at the pungent perfume smell of the leaked shampoo. I had expected something light and `clear' and not this heavy perfume stench. Once I finished washing the bottle off, the scent stayed on my hands for hours afterwards, lasting through several thorough hand washings. For someone like me who prefers most products to be unscented, this was a huge turnoff.<br /><br />Although the shampoo has a heavy perfume scent, it isn't quite as bad when used in the hair as it had been when it was leaked out of the bottle. It is still a stronger scent than I like, but not as bad as I feared.<br /><br />The shampoo washes fine but I have to say that it doesn't do any better than the Pantene Shampoo that I have used for some time. It also doesn't seem to make any difference in my hair's volume than my Pantene offers.<br /><br />Once this bottle is finished, I will return to Pantene. I prefer it's lighter, fresh scent and am very satisfied with how it cleans my hair.","'Clean' shampoo has a pungent perfume scent, works OK as a shampoo",3

"Okay, this will teach me twice about checking the weight of something before I buy it!  I love these gummy candies and always stock up on them whenever I hit the Asian grocery stores.  So when I saw them online, I admit to being a bit lazy and thought 'hey, it'll be nice to take advantage of getting them shipped home for free' and wrongly assumed that the price of the bag meant that they must be jumbo-sized or something.  So yeah, a bit surprised when the package arrived and it's the same size bag that I can usually get for a few bucks cheaper in a store.  Also, the bag was past its 'best sold by' date (not that the candies tasted stale).<br /><br />Still, these candies are delicious, a nice sweet/tart gummy treat that's individually wrapped (great if you like to share or put something unique out for people) and has a good fruit flavor.

"I am a lover of dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, this chocolate will disappoint true dark chocolate lovers.  Its waaaay too sweet!

Also, the Newman's chocolate is broken into six relatively large 1.5 x 1.25 inch squares - IMO just a little too large to just put one square in your mouth and allow it to melt away.  The Dove is broken into 1 x 1 inch squares - the perfect size to melt on your tongue.  Even the wrapper on the Dove is better as it is true foil and easily allows you to keep the remaining chocolate wrapped up tight.  The Newman's comes in gold paper meant to look like foil, but its only paper - it does not close well.  Overall, disappointed.","nice dark chocolate, but too sweet for my taste",3
"Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it.

The third dog seems to enjoy all of it just fine, which is the reason for my 3-star (average) rating.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was that the bag was as large as an 8lb bag of dry kibble, but only half the weight.

"On the back of the package there's the question ""What makes a well rounded meal for adult dogs""?  Well, according to the Chef Michael recipe it's MEAL.  Though beef is listed as the first ingredient (and is about 28%) the rest of the meal is meal.  Soybean meal, corn gluten meal, poultry by-product meal, plus soy flour, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, ground yellow corn (corn flour), ground wheat (isn't this flour?), pearled barley and glycerin.  Additives include animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols and animal digest (duh!).  Other fun stuff like salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor (so it tastes like steak not meal) dried green beans and dried potatoes and a lot of chemicals.  If you're wondering why so many meal and other flours, it's so that they can say that Beef is the number one ingredient.<br /><br />The bag says all the stuff up above makes it ""Grilled sirloin steak flavor and potato & green bean garnishes"".  A ""garnish"" is an item or substance used as a decoration or embellishment accompanying a prepared food dish or drink, per Mr. Collegiate Webster.  In other words, it's there to make things look better, but better for who (or is it whom?).  Now my dog doesn't have that sophisticated a palate, he's a rescue from a West Virginia and he likes a garnish of dog poop with his road kill, vegetables are for 'sissy' metro-dogs.<br /><br />This is a 'well rounded meal for adult dogs' containing 23 essential vitamins and minerals. (Since so many of these Vs and Ms are supplied by those unpronounceable chemicals, I feel like I'm poisoning my dog while I'm making him healthier.)  Per the bag they (Nestles Purina PetFood Company) prepare it with care (no added artificial preservatives, just lots of natural chemicals) and you then serve it with love (love is not included, you have to supply your own).<br /><br />""Animal feeding tests using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures sustantiate that Chef Michael.... provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs.  (Just remember to change their oil every six months, rotate their paws and vacuum their coats periodically. 'I confess, I made that up.')  'The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a non-profit organization which sets standards for the quality and safety of animal feed and pet food.  ... there are non-voting advisors on each AAFCO committee who are mainly from industry, such as the National Grain and Feed Association, Pet Food Institute, and American Feed Industry Association. Unlike the FDA, AAFCO has no regulatory authority.'<br /><br />OK, let's remember that it's dog food.  Years ago we never bought dog food, the dog ate what we ate, with a little oil added from packed sardines to add luster to the dog's coat.  Dogs are carnivores.  In the wild they are scavengers and eat anything that isn't tied down, or tied down to long.  All these meals and flours are added for one reason and one reason only, 'THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN MEAT'.  Like most pet food, it's made to look and smell better to owners, most dogs could care less what it costs (unless they're an economics major) so I buy the cheapest I can find.  Make your own decision.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz",Especially good if your dog is a Vegetarian,3

The issue is I seem to crave it when I'm so comfortable on the couch after a long day and don't feel like warming up milk, mixing in cocoa, sugar, and a touch of salt to get delicious hot cocoa.  So where does this leave me?  I could, for about 20 cents per packet, get swiss miss hot chocolate packets and dump it in water and drink it, is it delicious? Not really, but I get my fix.  Problem is, you have to heat the water, pour in the powder, mix it, and deal with the clumps and clean up.  Not my favorite thing to do at 930pm (do your best to not think I'm completely worthless).  Now that I have a keurig, I thought this would fix everything AND give me great hot cocoa.  Well, I do have convenient, clean, easy to prepare hot cocoa, but its...about as good as swiss miss.  So yes, it does satisfy my fix, and at only 70 cals and 5 g sugar, I can deal with that as well.  I'm sure if mixed a little land o lakes low fat half and half in there it would be significantly better.<br /><br />I'm astonished by all these negative reviews of k cups in general, the idea behind k cups was convenience, not necessarily the BEST beverage available.  Lets be honest, using a burr grinder, fresh beans, and a french press  = best coffee ever, loose leaf teas and kettle of water = best tea ever, and the aforementioned steps to hot cocoa from scratch = best hot cocoa ever.  The problem is, all of these methods require time to be spent on ourselves, something our society so heavily frowns upon.  With my keurig, I wake up, walk down stairs, have a true American sized variety of well marketed beverages, pop one in, and have piping hot average to above average coffee and teas in less than 30 seconds.  So if you want GREAT beverages, make it yourself.  If you want GOOD beverages that are convenient and clean, get a keurig and lower your expectations a smidge!","Tastes like swiss miss, but so convenient swiss miss",3

"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food is like McDonald's for dogs.  The stuff looks tasty, smells great (apparently), and must taste really good because my papillon practically swallows the stuff whole without chewing.  But, is it healthy?  Not really.  If you read the ingredient list (and read a few of the user reviews), you'll see that this dog food is really not that healthy (or that great of a deal, considering how much more the dog needs to eat in comparison to a high quality brand to get full.<br /><br />If I were judging this dog food just based on favor and reaction from my dog, this would be a winner!

"I love the flavor of this gum and I love that it is healthy.  All 5 flavors taste great to me.  I think the price is also great.<br /><br />That being said, I will be trying other brands and options before buying this again.  The flavor lasts right around 30-45 seconds of normal chewing.  I usually pop in a new piece every few minutes depending upon my mood.  Sometimes I'll chew up to 10 pieces in a 30 minute timeframe.  I like to have flavor for at least a few minutes and this gum does not do this.<br /><br />Initially when I tried these, I would have given them 4 or 5 stars.  But now that I'm so used to the flavor disappearing on me quickly, 3 stars is the perfect rating for me.<br /><br />I would maybe buy again.

"This is not a bad beverage but great either, and given how messy it is to make I wish I hadn't bothered with it. The serving size is huge; I used my biggest mug and I still had to stop the machine early to keep it from overflowing. It uses 2 milk cartridges and in between them 1 espresso cartridge. It's hard to taste the coffee at all in the result because there's so little of it compared to the milk. Unsurprisingly the milk tastes like reconstituted powdered milk and the flavor is just a bit off compared to natural milk. So you get a huge serving of milk that doesn't even taste great, with a tiny bit of coffee somewhere in it. I ended up making it with just 1 milk and 1 espresso cartridge and even so it tasted a lot more like milk than coffee.<br /><br />The visual effect of coffee sandwiched between milk looks beautiful on the packaging, but keep in mind that you won't see it unless you actually have transparent mugs or heat-proof glasses.<br /><br />Finally there's just no good way to remove the used milk cartridges from the machine without spilling hot milk on your fingers and making a mess. They're only half empty when they're done and if you don't flip them over extremely fast, you'll get hot milk on your fingertips. I am particularly sensitive to heat so this might not be a problem for others - however the issue about the cartridges dripping over the machine and all the way to the trash can will always be there.<br /><br />The beverage has an interesting flavor and it's a pretty original idea for a coffee machine so I don't regret trying it once, but it's not worth bothering with on a regular basis.","Messy, huge servings, more milk than coffee",3

These crackers have a nice, creamy taste to them and they pack 7 grams of fat per serving. Yes, that is fewer grams than potato chips, but for a cracker I think that's pretty high in fat content. The taste, however, is very good and these would make a good snack if consumed in moderation. One concern for me was the state of the crackers I received. I tasted these as part of the Vine program and the box I received was very smashed up and the crackers were partially obliterated. If I were buying these crackers, I would have been upset about their smashed-up condition. Perhaps it would not be a good idea to buy these in bulk until you can verify that shipping of these crackers won't damage the product.",Quite tasty but high in fat content,3

"Most energy drinks don't live up to the buzz.  They taste awful and the energy boost never<br />equals the hype.  So it was with some trepidation that I tried No Fear Super energy Supplement.  One large can contains two servings so I split it with a friend.  He thought it tasted like a strong strawberry soda but didn't notice any energy boost.  I would describe the flavor as a grapefruit.It was pretty good, excellent for an energy drink with only a slight and short lasting metallic afertaste.  I too noticed no discernable difference in my energy. I am a heavy coffee drinker however my friend does not imbibe so I can't attribute the lack of effect to caffeine resistance..

"I love tea.  Iced tea, hot tea, green tea, black tea, all kinds.  I was excited to try this product because I am always short on time and thought a powdered, just add water mix would be great.  One major problem, this ""tea"" has zero tea flavor.  It also claims to be ""sweetened with honey"" but it is actually sweetened with sucralose in addition to ""honey granules"".  Because of this, it has a very strong ""diet"" aftertaste, something I am not fond of at all.  Overall the drink was far too sweet for my liking even though I made it with 20oz of water instead of the 16 recommended.  I was really disappointed by this product.  I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; ""Sweetened with honey"" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention ""no aspartame"" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.  As far as powdered diet drinks go, this one would be low on my list.  Even drinks like Crystal light do not have this strong of a diet aftertaste.",Misleading and far too sweet,3

"Review update - 7/12/2012<br />I'm sad to say that the new, purple box packaging for this tea contains artificial flavors.  Why, oh why, did Good Earth have to change this tea, when it was perfectly fine and good the way it was?  I am terribly disappointed by this change, and have amended my star rating to reflect this.<br /><br />Original Review - 10/4/2010<br />First, to the Natural/Artificial concerns - it really does say Natural Flavors in the ingredient list, NOT artificial as some of the reviews state.  Box also states ""No sugar, caffeine, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives"".  I've submitted a picture of the ingredients list to Amazon, which you can view at the top of this item page.<br /><br />Ingredients list:<br />Red Rooibos, Chicory Root, Natural Flavor, Rosehips, Cinnamon, Lemongrass, Peppermint, Papaya, Chamomile, Panax Ginseng Leaves, Anise Seed, Dandelion Root, Ginger Root, Orange Oil, Orange Peel.<br /><br />I was given my first box of this tea by a friend who knew I liked cinnamon tea.  Up to that point, my favorite tea was Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice.  But when I tried Good Earth, I fell in love!  Now I cannot find it anymore in any of the local stores that carried it, so I signed up for the regular shipments from Amazon.<br /><br />Everyone I have shared this tea with tell me how much they enjoy it, that it hardly seems possible for tea to have such intense flavor and not need sweetening.  I have to be sure to get some before my husband & kids finish the box without my getting a chance to have a few myself!  Seems like every time I visit my mom now, she makes up some of this for us to share as some iced tea.<br /><br />I do not use any sweetener, which says a lot because I use sweetener with pretty much every other kind of herbal tea I drink.  Good Earth is great hot or cold, and it sure does give my tastebuds a gingerbread-like warmth on a fall or winter morning.  There is no tea-ish, bitter taste or aftertaste.<br /><br />If you love cinnamon, gingerbread, or a really good caffeine-free tea that doesn't need sweetening, give this one a try!","Updated Review - The original was best, why change?",3

The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.

"It was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from Amazon but I decided that I would ""give it a go"" since I like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and I figured that these could only be better since they'd be fresher when microwaved.

Regardless of the taste, I can't seem to get used to the smell.  Secondly, when it comes to popcorn, I have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn.  I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldn't be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.

Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description.

I do not think this is as good. It does have a bit of smoke flavor, and that's pleasant, but I find it has a noticeable artificial taste that was missing from the jalape&ntilde;o sauce. It's almost a rubber-like taste (not texture--that's fine), and I'm not sure how much it would have to be diluted to make it go away. We tried it straight on tacos, and while my husband said it was good enough, it still tasted a bit like a tire to me. I'm not sure whether this means I am a delicate and sensitive flower, or that he is an oblivious lout with no sense of nuance. I will allow that I might have been looking for it after taking a taste directly from the bottle--not the best idea I've ever had.<br /><br />I'll work with it some more to see if I can find a dish it goes with well; it's not a total loss, and we'll finish the bottle--eventually.","All right, but not extraordinary",3

"I have 4 mini dachshunds and 1 is very picky. They have tried FunBites CalciBone chew sticks, and 3 out of 4 dogs loved them, so I was hopeful for these bones. Unfortunately, the picky one didn't like them again, and one dog, who usually likes every bone she can get, was easily distracted. She chewed on it a little, and then lost interest. The other two dogs, however, loved them.<br /><br />They are much bigger than the Chew Sticks- about an inch in diameter. There is a hard rawhide outside and a dry mixed tube of a peanut butter mixture on the middle. In some bones, the middle is firmly attached to the rawhide, making the chew time much longer (a plus since it keeps them busy longer), but in others, the rawhide is pinched and the middle tube slides out with a little chewing. This made the bone disappear quickly.<br /><br />An odd thing might keep me from buying these bones- there are 7 bones in a bag. By not having an even number, it means I have to buy 4 bags to give each dog one without leftovers. This wouldn't matter if you had a different number of dogs, but for me, it is an issue. Since the dogs were lukewarm towards them, I would probably choose to buy a bone with an even number in the bag.

"I've made red velvet pancakes from scratch before but I bought this to make Sunday morning breakfast prep go a little quicker. The pancakes are good, the recipe for the frosting is good, however - the box says to use 2/3 cups of water with 1 cup of pancake mix. This is NOT correct, I ended up having to use almost half the canister of mix for that 2/3 cups of water. I don't know if this is just a mistake on the can but it was annoying that I've now used half the can on one breakfast for two (when there is supposed to be a lot more servings than that per canister). I'm not sure I would repurchase, this is more convenient than making them from scratch but in the end I don't know if it's worth the price if I only get 4 meals out of it.",Wrong Directions?,3

"When I saw this PETITE CUISINE GRILLED TUNA TREATS product for cats, I KNEW I had to let me Muffin, Ginger and Peaches try it for themselves. I'm all about feeding them healthy and the omega-3/omega-6 fats in this were a huge plus in my book. When I opened up the package, I was impressed to see the tuna actually looked like tuna and not some fake tuna-like substance. And there was a little zip lock on it so you could portion out the amount of treats for your feline friends and then reseal it. Cool. But what was not-so-cool was just how messy it was to take out of the bag, dripping wet and splashing all over the front of my shirt, big long chunks that has to be broken up by hand before sharing with my cats. While they devoured this special treat as soon as it hit the floor, their owner was busy washing his soiled shirt and trying to get that awful ""fishy"" smell off of his hands. There's got to be a better way to get the treat chunks into smaller pieces and not so messy...maybe individually wrapping each bite-sized portion would be better. It's not a bad product, but it could be better.","Cats Devoured It, Quite Messy For Us Humans Though",3
"Pricey:  About $12.56 per gallon with Amazon'z 15% discount and free shipping or $14.77 per gallon with free shipping and no discount.  To much for me.  You can buy a bottle of soda water, cherry juice and sugar for a lot less and it will taste similar.  Additionally, it seems like just a few months ago that we moaned every time we had to fill the gas tank for $4 a gallon.  That was gas and even with our gas guzzler that goes into heat every time it sees a gas station, it was a  tad cheaper than Switch.<br />Sweet:  With 33 grams of sugar this is just too much.  That produces an eight ounce can's 130 calories.  If you drink a 16 ounce container of this drink you will get 250 calories.  A regular Coke or Dr. Pepper each has fewer grams of sugar and therefore fewer calories compared to Switch.<br />Colored Water:  Calling this 100% Juice is probably permitted by our government or whomever sets those words in practice, but this is mostly carbonated water.  I guess carbonating the water makes it more expensive but that expensive?<br />Taste:  Pleasant and not a lagging post taste.<br />Bottom Line:  Buy it in the store:  No.  Buy it anywhere:  Probably not.

"Each box contains 6 individually packaged (""Packs To Go"") cookies.<br /><br />The cookies list out at 1.48 oz each and 180 calories.<br /><br />The cookies are anywhere from 3 to 3.25 inches in diameter, and uniformly about a half inch thick.<br /><br />They do come out of the wrapper pretty soft and when you break the cookie in half it splits pretty well and doesn't crumble too much.<br /><br />I noticed a great deal more almond pieces in my cookies than chocolate ""chunks"", but I also noticed some of the chocolate had melted int he wrapper and was maybe left inside.<br /><br />The texture is good, but once you start chew the cookie just kind of come apart in your mouth, but in my experience that is how most ""Soft Baked"" cookies are.  Plus, these are oatmeal cookie so the texture is much looser, you do definitely see and taste the oats which is nice.<br /><br />The flavor is okay, the chocolate is nothing special, I would say the almonds are of good quality and flavor.  The cookie itself is sweet, but not too, with an okay butter and vanilla flavor to them.  Which is surprising since there is no butter in the ingredients, I can only guess the flavor was added.<br /><br />Overall a decent cookie, nothing special, but they are soft, and come individually wrapped so you don't have to worry about them drying out.  I think without much effort you could make something just as good at home, but if you are looking for something to throw in the lunchbox that provides some fiber (4g) and some nuts (3g protein) you wouldn't be too far off going with these.<br /><br />If you have a question feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer.",Not too bad for a soft baked cookie,3

"I admit I have been addicted to hazelnut coffee for years, especially for the first pot in the morning. Even when I find something I like I can't help but experiment.  I think I am like many coffee lovers, always looking for that perfect blend, no matter how much we may like what we already have.  I drank Harmony hazelnut for years.  It is a staple item at one of those warehouse markets here where I do my regular shopping.  There is no question that Harmony is a bargain for flavored coffee.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a better deal on a hazelnut blend anywhere, even here on Amazon.  And there is also no doubt that it is a decent coffee, I drank it for years as already stated.  However as also before mentioned, when it comes to the perfect cup of coffee, I just can't help but wonder if the grass over the next rise is really greener.  I one day picked up another Hazelnut and realized then that though the Harmony is a decent blend and great bargain, there is no doubt in mind that is it most definitely a weaker blend. Even compared to other regular supermarket brands. And I found it very ""hollow"" tasting in comparison to other fancier hazelnuts on Amazon that do not cost that much more, (like Melitta's Hazelnut Creme, much stronger).  I have since parted ways with Harmony and gone for the stronger brew in a variety of blends that cost a little bit more.  In conclusion, I recommend Harmony if you are a hazelnut junkie and have limited funds to support the habit.  However if you are someone that like me is on a never ending quest for the cup of java to die for, I suggest you skip this bargain and keep looking.  You may not settle on what I have, but it's my feeling you will come to the same conclusion that the Harmony is a good deal, but a weak competitor at best...<br /><br />PS:  A recent review of this blend has shown that it is no longer the great bargain it used to be.  Not only is Harmony not eligible for free shipping, but it is also not available for the subscription service where one gets a discount, and free shipping.  I have since lowered the rating of this coffee to 3 stars.  No longer the bargain it once was, but still just as weak...",A Great Bargain Hazlenut....But Weak,3

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:31 Mins<br /><br /></span>Maybe living in Seattle has made me a bit of a coffee snob, but this caffe lungo does not really impress!<br /><br />See video for demonstration.<br /><br />The instructions have two ways to pull the beverage. 4 ounces for a ""long espresso"" (this is a lungo) or 6 ounces for an Americano.

"Cereal with nuts and no preservatives can develop a rancid taste pretty quickly if it's not consumed before the ""sell by"" date.<br /><br />Unfortunately the order we received from Amazon was over two months past its expiration date, and it noticeably tasted stale.<br /><br />It took quite a while to find the sell-by date. The Alpen box is a very light tan color, and the date is printed in white on the box top. It's practically invisible. I had to angle it just right toward a light source in order to read it.<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns of grocery items, which is a good policy, but they did give a prompt refund.<br /><br />Judging from the other reviews, I'm sure the cereal is excellent when it's fresh.

"I've had some of the Nut-Thins crackers before, and I enjoyed them.  That being said, this wasn't my favorite flavor of them.  It just didn't have that great of a taste.<br /><br />I love pretty much anything flavored ranch.  Dressing, powder, popcorn, etc., it's all good.  This however, was not as good of a ranch.  It started out with a good initial flavor, kind of a buttermilk light flavored ranch with a punch of garlic, but then the taste quickly devolved into a pretty gross tasting after-taste.  And I think this was from the rice flour used.  I'm not a fan of rice flour, there's just something slightly sour about the taste that I really don't like the taste.  So to go from a lovely ranch to that just ruined the cracker for me.<br /><br />I was surprised at how many ingredients were in these crackers since they are natural and gluten free.  I'm guessing most of it was the flavoring, but it was still quite long.  And the first ingredient was rice flour.  So right there's where I had my problem.  The next was the almonds luckily so at least they were right up there, and then the rest was the ranch flavoring.  I was surprised that there wasn't that much garlic in there, because it was such a predominant flavor in the cracker.  It also had a few ingredients I couldn't pronounce, but always make me wary.  Although it's hard to say without an intense research if these are natural or not.  And I'm just not that ambitious.<br /><br />Calories are 130 a serving, and that's about 16 crackers.  So in all, that's actually pretty good.  It's perfect for accompanying a meal or you can just snack on them without worrying too much.  And there's about 4 servings per box.  Sodium is slightly high at 220mg a serving, but sugars are only 1 gram.  And there's 3 grams of protein.  For vitamins, there aren't a whole lot worth mentioning; it's not the main point of these crackers.<br /><br />Ok crackers, I like some of the other flavors, but I won't be buying this flavor again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",Almond Nut Thins Country Ranch,3

"The bars are about 3/4th the size of a Clif bar and have the same sort of consistency. The smell of the coconut is pretty powerful when you open the package and the bars themselves don't really have a decent taste. I don't know if this is because it's gluten-free or what, but it tastes sort of like a dry tasteless oatmeal cookie. The chocolate didn't help add to the flavor. It's moist to the point where it feels damp and you can easily break it apart but I thought it was kind of bland and I felt like I needed to wash it down with lots of water.<br /><br />I'm a guy who likes snacks, and I'm a sucker for chocolate chip granola bars. This should be right up my alley. But it doesn't taste that great. If you're under certain dietary restrictions, you might feel differently but I wouldn't buy this as a snack.",Average tasting bars,3

"A single pouch of this tea makes a small very strong cup of ginger flavored tea. The small grains dissolved instantly. I could not taste any lemon flavor and very little if any honey flavor. The Ginger was almost medicinally strong and somewhat bitter, though it did not sting the throat like fresh ginger does at this intensity, nor did it clear the sinus. I think this is too strongly flavored to accompany most food, though it might go well with some cookies or possibly cheese. I do not know if it would be effective for motion sickness or other nausea and so far as I can tell this is being marketed as a beverage. It is not particularly sweet but also has none of the tartness one expects from lemon. The strength reminded me of  a very strong ginger ale without the fizz.  I can see that this might be convenient to take on the road  but for day to day use I think I will stick with making my own ginger, lemon and Honey drinks with fresh ingredients.",intense ginger flavor,3

"These bars are high in calories which is a good thing when hiking or performing some other strenuous exercise.  But they are not very high in flavor which is not such a good thing when eating them.  The bars are soft and have a brownie like texture.  The chocolate flavor is not pronounced, it is a dry cocoa flavor and texture.  Almond slivers are in the bars, there is a crunch every couple of bites, but the almond flavor is overpowered by the cocoa.

"""The Switch"" seems to be another take on carbonated fruit drinks. It immediately reminded me of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO"">Izze</a> line of drinks that I've tried in the past...same size, and same basic idea of just fruit juice and carbonated water. After trying this one sample though, I'd have to say I prefer Izze. The black cherry Switch that I tried had a decent enough flavor (very mild cherry flavor but still pleasant), but it was really sweet, and had even more sugar per can than Izze, which was already pretty high. I think these drinks are a nice alternative to sodas, if you just have to have something with fizz and can't take artificial sweeteners. Definitely a better choice for kids who want something sweet but at least a tad healthier since these are natural sugars with a lower glycemic index. But it's still a simple sugar, and there's a LOT of it in this drink, 33g in 8.3 oz. The price is also pretty hefty, at almost $1 a can. Personally, I think I do just as well getting fruit juice of my choosing and adding some club soda to it for fizz. But when I am in the mood for something sweet to pack for a hike, etc. and just have to have something, I'd probably look for Izze drinks first.",A bit too sweet for my liking,3

"I have been using this shampoo for a week now. I have been using it alone, without the additional conditioner. My hair is long, straight and very fine. I use volumizing shampoos as a matter of routine. I usually move between <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ISB3AG"">Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139353Q"">Paul Mitchell Thickening Shampoo, Lemon Sage</a>. Both of these work great for me, although they have different issues. Pantene is instant volume, but coats your hair. Lemon Sage, if used with the conditioner, works well but costs a good bit more. It also creates build-up, but not nearly as quickly.<br /><br />I found this shampoo pretty much on par with those (left my hair soft, full and pleasantly but not strongly scented), with one exception - my hair looks pretty good immediately after I wash it, but not so good the day after, and since I typically wash my hair in the evening this means I don't get the benefit when I want it most. Both Pantene and Lemon Sage seem to last from shampoo to shampoo.<br /><br />Like Pantene, this product does build-up. The effect of this is to actually weigh down your hair and make it look flat and greasy. This can be counteracted by periodically using a good clarifying shampoo - weekly or every other week. I'm in-between at the moment, as the one I've used for some time has gone off the market. I wound up picking up <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027C9CS"">Suave For Men, Deep Clean Peppermint</a> even though I'm not a man, because it was the only one the store I was in seemed to carry, and I was out. But I'm in the market for something better. This one strips away the build-up, but it's very harsh; it actually burns my scalp.<br /><br />I experienced the same problem many others have reported: while it was only a small amount, my bottle leaked in shipment. I doubt I lost much product, but who would want to lose any? If I ever decide to pick this up again (and I may not, given the next day issue), I'll probably look for it in a store.<br /><br />I'll note that the product may perform better with the matching conditioner, but it might also lead to quicker product build-up.",Serviceable shampoo perhaps better suited for buying in person,3

"I am doing this review simply as a 'heads-up' for those who may think this is coconut oil for cooking - it is not!<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my kitchen for cooking - this came up on an Amazon search for coconut oil, but it's not for cooking, it's a hair oil.  Yes, that's clearly stated in the Product Features, but some folks may not see that.  It may not be eatable, for there's something in it that is keeping it from solidifying at room temp as normal coconut oil does - perhaps a chemical.  But as you can see, Amazon is treating it as a 'Grocery' item, and that alone will cause some to order it as a food item.  In my opinion, it should be labeled as a hair oil, and more clearly stated in Amazon's description.<br /><br />Be careful.",Be Careful Here!,3

"I've long been a fan of the Haribo gummi bears, and in fact won't even eat most other gummy bears. We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.",A bit harder and more stale than Haribos generally are,3

"This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 130 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, acerola, and cherry juice reconstituted with carbonated water with added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement of vitamin C. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a ""natural"" beverage.<br /><br />I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Black Cherry didn't compare well to what I'm used to in that regard.<br /><br />The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing on the mouth as juice and seltzer.<br /><br />The black cherry flavor didn't appeal to me. This formulation doesn't have the bite that usually comes from tartness that I'm used to in juice-flavored beverages. The taste starts feeling a little blah and ends on a strong cherry-cola-like note that's stronger than I like.<br /><br />As a result, the effect is more like drinking cherry cough medicine with carbonation than it is like tasting something tasty, light, and refreshing.<br /><br />I wouldn't seek this item out again in this flavor, even though I like black cherry flavor.<br /><br />I do know that peoples' tastes vary. This flavor reminds me of the flavors that I used to taste at Heublein in pre-mixed cocktails which didn't appeal to me but which many other people found delightful.",Carbonation Makes 100 Percent Juice Lighter.

"There used to be a product called, ""Mrs Allen's Stop Shed."" There were separate products for dogs and cats. In March of 2006 Farnam Pet Products announced that it had acquired Mrs. Allen's Shed-Stop from Stabar Enterprises, Inc. Once acquired, Farnam changed the ""Stop Shed"" name to ""Shed Solutions"" and then discontinued the one specifically for cats. This is a case where a company acquires a product/brand (in this case, Mrs. Allen's) and messes a good thing up. I used the original products on dogs and cats for years and they were terrific. I emailed the Farnam in December of 2010 and explained my frustration that they no longer produced and sold the product made specifically for cats, and was politely told to go elsewhere for my cat shedding problem. So, now I use the ""Shed Solutions for Dogs"" for our family dog and cat. They both seem to like the favor, and it does help. Is it as good as the old product? I don't think so, but it definitely helps. We are stuck with this product until Farnam dusts off the original formula and offers one for dogs and cats, or Mrs. Allen comes out of retirement!",Change isn't always good!,3

"What this product (the original, not the flavored) does for coffee is nothing short of heavenly. It smooths away bitterness while allowing great coffee flavor to come through.

"I live near Seattle and have drunk ""Pike's Place Roast"" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side.

"I honestly think I've been through the entire world's selection of dry cat foods.  The winner?  Purina Pro Plan's Salmon formula.  That's wolfed down entirely and no teeth marks in them either.

Now, I have had dog food that had a smaller kibble than this stuff has - but he really wanted to eat it so being the dedicated cat person that I am, I smashed a few of them and hand-fed them to him.  The guy just gobbled them up!  He just loves the flavor, but I can't buy it unless I take stock in Sears - all those hammers I'll have to go through just to break it up small enough for him.

I put the bag down and went back to it later. on my second attempt I began to feel the same thing. Maybe it was the grease/fat (although it does not appear greasy) from the baked cheese, I'm not sure. Everytime I went to bag after a few bites I got this same feeling in my stomach. I let other people try them and they liked the taste and crunchy texture but I noticed no one finished one of the 0.5 oz bags.

"I purchased a couple of cases of Vita Coco coconut water on a whim, having heard great things about it from others and having read positive reviews for it online.  First off, for anyone unfamiliar with the product, or coconut water in general.  Coconut water does NOT taste anything like what you'd think.  I mean, come on, coconut water.  Sounds delicious right?  I hear coconut water, see the picture on the box, and imagine myself sitting on a beach banging open a coconut with a rock and drinking the sweet sweet juices inside.  Coconut water, unfortunately, does not match these expectations.<br /><br />When I first tried it, I couldn't quite place the taste.  It wasn't until a student of mine tried it and cringed, made a face, and commented that it tasted like glue that I recognized the flavor..no, I've never tasted glue, but if you taste the Vita Coco you'll understand what I mean.  There's a slightly unpleasant aftertaste as well.  I've never tried any other brand of coconut water, so I don't know if this is specific to this brand, or just what one should expect with all coconut waters.<br /><br />With all that said, the product actually isn't that bad when frozen to a slush.  I froze a half dozen of these and took them to the ball field with me, and after a half hour of baseball, these did a fantastic job of quenching everyone's thirst, with minimal wrinkling of noses.<br /><br />So to sum up, the product, if you are purchasing it primarily for the high potassium content and as an all natural sports drink, does its job admirably.  It rehydrates you and definitely helps in preventing any muscle cramps.  However, if you're thinking about purchasing this merely because it sounds as if it'd taste good, I'd suggest you think twice, or try a single box first to make sure you actually enjoy the taste(I believe they are sold at many supermarkets, I know I've seen them at Whole Foods before).",Tastes a bit like glue..,3

Nowdays it seems a bit watery to me and not nearly as flavorful as before and I have even bought a can or two that have been mostly watery sauce as opposed to full of beans.

"Celestial Seasonings is branching out and using Rooibus as a base for some of their newer fruit flavored herbal teas. Rooibos is naturally caffeine free and high in antioxidants.

Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

The best gluten-free crackers I've found so far are the brown rice crackers that come in a cellophane ""log""...at least you can see what you're getting for the money and they are crisp!

"I was researching different flavors and reviews on K Cups. I came across Jet Fuel which was supposed to be one of the ""Boldest"" K Cups available. They arrived this morning and I could not wait to try them in my machine. I was quite surprised on how not so ""Bold"" they tasted!<br />I have tried quite a few other brews and I found the ""Jet Fuel"" to be the same or less ""Bold"" than the other ones.<br />I would suggest if you are considering this brand due to its ""Bold"" flavor that you only purchase a small amount first. I purchased 2- 50 count boxes and sure I will use them but I will still use the other brands that seem to be more ""Bold"" such as ""Expresso Roast"" and others.",It's OK!,3

"Lipton's Tea & Honey Iced Green Tea, the Blackberry Pomegranate flavor this time around, has a perky berry taste I like, unfortunately with the slight after taste of a diet drink (possibly the sucralose sweetener).

I appreciate being able to make some bottles ahead of time.",I love adding it to my water bottles!,3
"Very good peanuts if you like the taste of Szechuan peppercorns.  They had a very strong peppercorn flavor and also a nice amount of flavor and heat from the chili peppers.  These nuts also have much more crunch than American roasted peanuts.  I like it, but some people think the Asian nuts are too hard.  My only real problem with this product is the price.  If you have an Asian market anywhere near where you live, you can buy these for less than 1/2 of what I paid for them -- and I bought them from Amazon at clearance sale price.","Good nuts, but way too expensive",3

"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked.

Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.",Prefer other flavors,3

"I have had some of the other cheese snacks, and liked the nacho flavored.  If you have not had these before, they are literally cheese formed into a small disk and baked until hard like a cracker.  Being a low carb guy, I like them because they are easy to pack along, and are reminiscent of the crunch you get from crackers.  This particular flavor though, is underwhelming, there is not enough jalapeno flavor, and the whole thing tastes a bit like bland cheese.  Still, they are ok, and I will eat them, but not as tasty as some of the other offerings.....",OK as a low carb treat,3

"Have been enjoying this tea with the warmer days here. Easy to mix and toss in a couple of ice cubes.<br /><br />If not for the following two complaints, I could give this product 5-stars:<br /><br />1) Half a pouch is deemed a serving. Okay, 5 calories vs. 10 calories isn't a big deal, but seriously who is only going to use half of one of these tiny tubes? Most people don't even understand how little 8oz is. Starbucks serves 8oz short drinks, but they don't list it on the menu and people would probably laugh when they saw the size...just as an example.<br /><br />2) Advertising that there is NO aspartame is hugely misleading because it 'suggests' there is no artificial sweetener since honey is prominently displayed and listed. Yes, there is no aspartame, but there's sucralose, which is also an artificial sweetener. And WHY even have an artificial sweetener when honey is the very first ingredient listed?<br /><br />I don't get why it's difficult to reconcile such issues as the ones I've noted here.<br /><br />Like I said, the tea is tasty and refreshing, but those who make the product, package the product and market the product need to get real.",Tasty and refreshing,3

"PAMELA'S OAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COCONUT WHENEVER BAR, with a glass of cold skim milk, was my after-dinner dessert this evening. While it served its purpose as a cap to the evening meal quite nicely, it left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, coconut was the only flavor discernable by me in the gustatory experience. Though obviously made with oats and containing chocolate chips, a taste of neither of those two ingredients came through.<br /><br />The ""mouth feel"" of the bar is pleasant enough. It's of medium density - as compared to the heavy density of a Bobo's Oat Bar (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714"">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) - and moist. Though the oat fiber is recognizably present in the texture, it's the flaked coconut that's most perceivable. The chocolate chips, while visible, contribute nothing at all in my opinion. (Again, if you're seeking a taste of oats, go to the Bobo's Oat Bar, which is very strong in that regard. If you're seeking the taste of chipped chocolate, don't dither about; go to a chocolate chip cookie, gluten-free if desired.)<br /><br />Pamela is apparently promoting an alternative snack for the nutritionally conscious and/or challenged as the packaging all but screams ""Wheat-Free"", ""Gluten-Free"" and ""Non-Dairy"", though the last claim is asterisked and clarified in the ingredients list with ""chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment.""<br /><br />The box also lists ""180 mg Omega 3 Fatty Acids"", ""9 Grams Whole Grains"" and ""0 Grams Trans Fats"", apparently for each 40 gram, 180 calorie, single-serving bar.<br /><br />To allow the buyers to feel altruistic when purchasing the product, it's also noted in the fine print that ""Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue and Autism Support Organizations."" Celiac sprue is caused, of course, by dietary gluten intolerance.<br /><br />While I'd otherwise award at least 4 stars to this bar, I'm only going as high as three because the product's taste potential seems so badly misrepresented by its name. Unless you especially like coconut, you may do better seeking gratification elsewhere. And if you dislike coconut, definitely steer clear.","A flavorful bar, but misrepresented",3
"I assume Kellogg is marketing this product towards adults who want a healthy cereal that does not lose its crunch over time. Why? The name is Crunchy Nut. The image on the box contains no cartoon characters. In fact, the box design is rather bland. Other than some text stating that ""It's Morning Somewhere"" therefore you don't need to wait until tomorrow to enjoy the ""perfect blend of sweet and nutty in every crunchy bite"", it's a pretty uninspiring package. Not at all for the kids...<br /><br />Is the cereal tasty? Yeah... I enjoyed it. Though immediately felt the need to workout even harder the next day.<br /><br />Why? The nutritional information states a serving size (3/4 C) contains 1 g of fat. If you add 1/2 C of skim milk, the fat content goes up. Carbs? 23 g before milk. Fiber? A meager 2 g -- a negligible amount. Protein? 2 g.<br /><br />Tastes good. Is crunchy, even with milk. But be prepared for that sugar crash late morning.<br /><br />I don't predict it will be around long. I'd much rather eat a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios... Similar taste and crunch with additional nutritional benefits.","More of a ""Kid"" Cereal",3

"This is marketed as ""thin style"", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars.","OK, but not great",3

"I love the idea of carbonated juice - I really do. I love carbonation. I love juice. Put them together and you should have a sweeter version of what you can make with club soda and juice. So one star earned for the idea. One star for the convenience of me not having to mix my own club soda with juice and one star for convenience that it is in a can. As for taste - I didn't like it much at all. It was just too sweet. I like soda, but this was just over the top. This particular version my wife and I both agreed that it tasted really close to strawberry poprocks, which in and of itself is a good thing. I just didn't care for it as a carbonated fruit juice.  I'm going to give this a partial fail. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't buy it again.",Overly sweet and tastes like poprocks.,3
Special K granola bars with Chocolate and Peanut Butter wasn't the best granola bar I've ever eaten.  It was pretty run of the mill.

Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown.

"I tried this Strawberry Acai Decaf Green Tea Mix along with my two daughters ages 10 & 12. My 10 year old didn't care for it, on the other hand, my 12 year old liked it and said it tastes like liquid strawberry jello. A serving size is 1/2 a packet and 8 oz of water, only 5 calories, and 1 gram of sugar. It is sweetened with honey and also sucralose. It is perfect for the 16.9 oz water bottles which would be double the serving if you are counting calories but still only 10 calories and 2 g of sugar. It does say it's Decaf Iced Green Tea, strawberry acai flavored. I don't taste any iced tea at all, if you like strawberry flavored drinks then you'd probably like it, because strawberry is definitely the only flavor you taste. It's great drink for kids being so low calorie and so low in sugar as compared to the usual juices for kids and the packets are also very easy to open. I only gave it 3 stars because for me it just wasn't the flavor I was looking for, I wanted to be able to taste the iced tea. I would try a different flavor or maybe just the plain iced tea.",Sweet Strawberry drink without all the calories and sugar,3

Some other brands have larger pieces. I've found a few pieces of the scratchy part in my bowl, now and then. And the flavor isn't all that well distributed even after I stir well.","Good, but not the best",3

"These apples taste fine, since there are no artificial additives, but they sure are small.  The average piece is 1/2 an inch by 1/2 an inch, which is quite pathetic and unsatisfying (for me).  I have to eat multiple pieces at once to notice any apple-like aromas.  I do appreciate the crunch but they also detracts from the sweetness, because its harder to dissolve and release the sugars when the pieces are this dry.  It's not a bad product, but I would not buy it again.",Why are the pieces so small?,3

"I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.<br /><br />I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello-like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.<br /><br />The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.<br /><br />At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture.",Good to know it's organic; not so great tasting,3

I am not thrilled with the Teriyaki flavor but it's ok, not too salty. The sweet hot is really hot so beware. This brand is the first jerky I am willing to re-order, which says a lot. Usually I get grossed out by the amount of sinew in packaged jerky but I have not found much in this brand yet.<br /><br />Updating after opening all 4 bags that came in an order: 3 bags were good but the 4th bag was all gristle and fat.

"I just received these so-called Cheddar Skinny Sticks, and a lot of reviewers who said that these ""Cheddar"" Skinny Sticks had a mild or non-existent cheddar flavor were right!  However, they were ok (I know this seems contradictory) but needed cheddar flavor (CHEDDAR PLEASE. Or, please, don't misleadingly call it cheddar).<br />  Or, at least enough to justify calling this product ""cheddar"". This snack only has an  extremely barely noticeable (only a slight hint of) cheddar flavor.<br />  The taste was very light/airy- kind of like Corn Flavored Bugles!  That's why I thought that they were ok (per my giving it the 3star 'ok' rating).  And, if you have a taste for a nice corn snack with a, virtually, nonexistent Cheddar flavor, then here they are.<br />  But, most are here looking for Cheddar Flavored Snacks vs others because we want to taste the Cheddar!  So, 2stars off for the makers neglecting this crucial fact. I really wanted to like these- cause, yes, admittedly, I am trying to get skinny and need a good cheddar flavored healthy snack.<br />  How cheap can you be to call something Cheddar, then, when you make it- barely include a cheddar taste within it??  The makers of this product need to SERIOUSLY read the reviews and consider putting some Cheddar Flavor in this product before they can be honest about calling it Cheddar. I'm disappointed- but this makes an ok corn snack.<br />  You want something that, truthfully, advertises itself having a certain flavor and lives up to it:  Like Doritoes or Cheetos? Or, even near that? Then, honestly, you need to keep looking.<br />  I hope that I've been helpful.","Honest, It's Ever So Slightly (barely) Flavored Cheddar Corn Air",3
"Well, when I ordered this I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it sure wasn't a roll on deodorant container filled with stinky liver flavored liquid.  For me personally, I've always stood by the belief that while the dogs are the one enjoying the dog toys and treats, the are more made for the humans than anything else and there is something totally repugnant about a dog eating from a deodorant container.<br /><br />Jilly, my puppy, loved it.  She kept on trying to take it out of my hand and bite at the container until she realized she had to lick but she did love the flavor.  The only real negative is that Jilly got ""liver breath.""  Also the ball in the container didn't spin and I had to squeeze and I got a drip or two on the floor.  I have wood floors so no harm no foul, but if you have carpeting you might get a stain, but Jilly helped with the clean up.<br /><br />But I couldn't quite get over the container and even though Jilly loved it the doggy breath and the fact I didn't like her licking a deodorant container was a big turn off.

"This is the first product I ordered from sprouthouse.  I used Kitchen crop sprouter to make sprouts.  But somehow more than 50% of seeds doesn't germinate.

But when I tried the plain alfalfa seeds which I got as sample pack with the sprouter,  they germinated fine and I got the good yield.  Later on I tried the Raddish mix from the sprout house and they seem to be doing fine. But this mix no matter what I do,  i.e., watering more number of times, keeping in dark place etc didn't help.

"These chopped clams are good- not great, but good. I add them to canned clam chowder to boost the protein content, and they are quite adequate for that. They aren't quite as sweet as my previous brand- but pricing was good, and because I'm disabled, the delivery to my door is also a perk.

"Seriously, there's a 'do not shake' warning on the can and it's there for good reason - the contents are under pressure so... you shake it at your own risk.<br /><br />As a coffee drinker, I can't say that I'm impressed by this canned Espresso to the point that I'd stop making my own but I suppose that's not the point of the 'illy'. No canned coffee can challenge the flavor and aroma of a freshly brewed cup but when that is not possible, here comes the 'illy' and... it's passable.<br /><br />If comparing canned coffees to canned coffees, the 'illy' espresso is okay as in 'decent' and probably preferable to most other canned brands but to call it 'espresso' is a bit of a stretch. It's got 'sugar' for starters, 50 calories worth of it and I don't know too many espresso drinkers that would tolerate sugar in their espresso drink. And it's not espresso-strong. It's a little stronger than the normally bland canned coffee but maybe only half-way between regular coffee and espresso. As for the taste, this is supposed to be made of 'Arabica' and maybe it is but it tastes more like instant coffee to me. Maybe Arabica-based, cold instant coffee.<br /><br />So... if stranded on an island or anywhere a decent cup of real coffee is not an option or you aren't in the mood or don't have the time to make your own, the 'illy espresso' is an option and at least as good, possibly better than alternative canned or bottled coffees. In other words, ""It's Okay"" (3 stars) if used as directed and your expectations are reasonably low.<br /><br />________________________________<br /><br />Note: Should this be chilled before use?

"This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.","decent dog food, but Fromm's is better",3

"I typically spend a lot of time on my reviews, checking facts and spelling and phraseology, hoping not to be horribly embarrassed when I re-read a review.  This product is not worth the effort.<br /><br />Chicken and Broccoli Skillets is relatively easy to prepare.  Essentially, everything goes in the pan and you simmer for a while.  The required chicken breast is not included.  The box says preparation time is about 20 minutes, and that seems about correct.<br /><br />The problem is what happens when the cooking is done.<br /><br />First, Cheesy Skillets looks unappetizing.  The color is off-white and looks absolutely nothing like the picture on the box.  The little pieces of broccoli from the box mostly disappear, covered by the cheese sauce.  In fact, the whole thing appears to be one color.  One way to help the appearance is to throw actual broccoli into the mix.<br /><br />Second, the flavor is plain.  When I say plain, I mean exceedingly plain.  I suppose if you are trying to cook in a way that is unlikely to offend anyone, the flavor of this stuff is it.  It reminded me of school cafeteria or chow line food.  I was able to detect a vague broccoli taste in combination with a mild cheese flavor.  Those two flavors were the sum total of the flavor experience.  I have no idea how to save the flavor.  This bland concoction needs a kick of some kind, but I am not sure what kind.  Since this is supposed to be a cheese based product, perhaps jalapenos.  Unfortunately, it would take more experimentation than I am interested in conducting.<br /><br />Third, the rice felt funny in my mouth.  I typically eat Asian style rice, which is somewhat sticky and has a nice body to it.  The rice in cheesy skillets is difficult to describe.  It seemed to have a vague pasta texture or consistency.  The rice was definitely slippery.<br /><br />Many products exist that have sort of base to which you add meat.  These product encompass hamburger, tuna, and chicken, at the very least.  We have been fans of Velveeta brand cheese for many years.  We will not be adding Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets to our list of favorite foods.<br /><br />Good luck!",Bland,3

"Well, hubby liked these and I did not.  He liked the variety of ""stuff"" in them--oats, choc. chips, coconut.  I thought they were a bit dry.  They are deceptively packaged.  Each box has 5 bars in packaging that is about twice the size of the actual bar. I anticipated that these might be a healthier choice but, after reading the ingredient panel, was disappointed.  These have as much junk in them as other bars on the market.

"I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.",Flavor Not What I Was Expecting,3

"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.","If it looks good, is it good for the cats?",3
"I like this item because it enables you to freeze baby food in larger portions than ice-cube trays, which is a good thing if your baby is a little pig like mine is.

I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.

"I love peanut sauce.  I hadn't tried a dried-sauce mix before.  This one has potential; the flavors are not bad underneath.  But the ""underneath"" is far underneath a lot of sugar.  I finished the original meal I made with the sauce but threw out the second packet in the box.<br /><br />Tastes differ, and clearly, this mix has fans.  I rarely post negative food reviews because many people interpret the criticism personally.  If you know that you like it, then Amazon's price is a bit lower than my local grocery store's where it is sold 2/pack. I'm posting this review to suggest that if you're thinking about buying the box of 12 on the basis of reviews alone--don't.  Try it first.  I've tried many new, locally unobtainable food items on the basis of reviews here, and usually, the reviews are reasonably accurate.  Not in this case.  But this mix is available in my out-in-the-sticks grocery store, so it might be in yours, too.  The sauce mix seems to be more widely available than the peanut bake mix.","Okay flavor, but awfully sweet",3

"I thought this was a great toy, but my shepherd mix (supposedly very smart according to several different trainers we've worked with) never really got into it.<br /><br />He likes tug toys, but this is not a great tug toy because the dog will grab the rope end, and you'll grab the plastic jug end. If your dog is any good at playing tug at all, you will lose every time.<br /><br />He did not seem to enjoy chewing the purple spiky part either.<br /><br />There was some interest in getting the treats out, but it never lasted very long. The treats have to be fairly small to come out. I spent nearly an hour cutting up treats to make them easy to get out, and that helped perk his interest a little, but he always went back to other toys.<br /><br />Maybe its too complex for him. He does LOVE another puzzle toy we have. Its like a buster cube, but its a tough rubber ball (melon sized) with a maze like center. You put treats in one side by pushing them through a crossed slit, and after some rolling they fall out a hole on the other side. He loves that toy. I think its cool, too, but I fear what might be growing inside it, and the only way I've figured out to clean it is to soak it in vinegar and then put it in the dishwasher and hope.<br /><br />This toy is at least easy to clean.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to a neighbor to see if her dog might like it better.","Cool toy, but dog not really interested",3

He is still considered to be in the puppy stage, but Merrick discontinued Puppy Plate so we decided to start him on adult food a few months early.

"Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally.","Perfect size, but goes quickly",3

"I was pleasantly surprised by Taco Bell's Ranchero sauce, so decided on a whim to give this a shot.  Lo and behold, we all liked this sauce even better.  It works better as a dipping sauce than does the Ranchero, and was really good with some quesadillas we prepared.  It also has the smokiness which I would expect from some with ""Chipotle"" in the name, and enhances a chicken taco without overwhelming anything.<br /><br />If you are looking for raw heat, this isn't going to do the job for you.  Our heat-crazed teenager simply mixes in one of his pepper-extract sauces and that appears to make him happy.  I was actually expecting this to be a bit more hot than it was, but it would appear that Taco Bell is trying to keep the boldness, as it were, under some control.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  I liked the Ranchero sauce enough, but didn't see it becoming a staple in our house.  However, I can see myself replacing the increasingly empty bottle of the Chipotle sauce.  Well done.",Really good!  Much better than I expected,4

"Bigelow Green Tea with Mint has a good flavor.  I drink mostly black teas, followed in frequency by some herbal blends, but not much green tea.  When I do grab the occasional green tea bag, though, I prefer this Green Tea with Mint variety over a straight green tea.<br /><br />Green Tea with Mint doesn't add any other flavors.  The package lists only green tea and mint leaves as ingredients.  The mint's presence is quite strong, even sharp, when I give a freshly opened tea bag the deep sniff test (my favorite moment with tea!) before placing it in the cup.  Once it is steeped, though, the mint is less pronounced, and I think the mint flavor is less strong than in Bigelow's Plantation Mint black tea.  In fact, in the aroma of the steeped tea, the mint is not particularly noticeable--the most noticeable scent to me once the tea is steeped is one very similar to that of fresh grass cuttings, and I mean that in a good way.  The smell is pleasant.<br /><br />For a mint tea, I prefer the Bigelow Plantation Mint, but then, I mostly prefer black teas.  If you like green teas, Bigelow Green Tea with Mint is a good variety.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.","OK, but Bigelow has better mint varieties",4
"this Markers are great, they smoothly write in fondant, gum paste and even chocolate! they arrived on time and the only reason why they did not get the 5 stars is because they need to be cleaned often while working with chocolate, the tip scrapes the chocolate a bit when you write and if left without cleaning, it won't write.<br />These are great for details on cake pops, they work wonderfully on candy melts.",Great marker!,4

"Rich and smoky. This is a good French Roast. The packaging allows you the fragrance of the ground coffee, which you don't get with standard K-cups. A box of 36 comprises three sealed plastic bags of twelve cups each. They are not resealable, so after I open a bag, I put it into a plastic storage container to preserve freshness. San Francisco Bay Coffee's K-cups will remind you of what it used to be like to open a coffee can. If you miss the rich coffee smell, but you don't use a basket accessory or one of the reusable K-cup accessories to hold your choice of loose ground coffee, consider giving this a try.",Good Flavor with the Fragrance too,4

"This tea had a refreshing, fruity flavor that was really delicious. Unlike most other Texans, however, I prefer my tea unsweetened most of the time. So, the Lipton was a little too sweet for my taste. Even knowing that it was honey flavored, I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is. As a comparison, I like the Lipton Citrus Green Tea in bottles, but it is right on the edge. This was maybe twice as sweet. However, the mango flavor was excellent. Over ice, this tea was great.",Tastes good but a bit too sweet for me.,4

"These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes great! I liked their blend of kiwi and berry because you can actually taste the kiwi in this drink. The carbonation is just right as well, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.<br /><br />So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....<br /><br />Personally, I like more than eight 1/2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1/2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories --- 134!<br /><br />Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.<br /><br />Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.<br /><br />I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories.",Refreshing & High Calorie,4

"I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.","Mild taste, easy to mix, will buy again",4

"I have to eat gluten and dairy free, and my husband and kids are nut allergic.  It is real difficult to eat on the go.  We keep these bars handy (I eat one every day at work).  I always keep a few in my purse and more on long road trips.  They are not the greatest tasting, but for the being gluten free and having less sugar than similar snack bars they aren't bad (ie don't expect a cookie or candy bar taste like those overly sweetened snack bars).  The sun butter crunch is my fav flavor, but The differences between flavors are not all that great.  They are however just the right amount of nutrition to get me through a few more hours of work, travel, or errrands until I can get home to safe food.  I have noticed the differences in bar shapes.  Seems like sometimes they are longer and thinner and other times shorter and fatter.  The shorter and fatter size can make a person feel like they've been cheated on product because there is so much space left in the packaging, but I could not be certain that the actual weights were any different.  This is definitely the cheapest place I've found to buy them.",Great portable nutrition for allergy sufferers,4

Still this is just a sauce, so I don't consider that too big deal, but mention it for those who might.<br /><br />Bottom line, yes, this is good on chicken and adds a nice smoky, spicy flavor which is what you want.","Better than I expected, not bad, fairly spicy.",4

"I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me).

"First of all, I am subscribed to receive two boxes of the variety pack every month. My cats LOVE the food and refuse to eat other canned food. I have tried to give them more expensive, better quality food but they only want Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />That said, I am quite disappointed at P.C.'s customer service. After researching on menadione, I emailed P.C. and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future. I never heard back from them. Before this, I received an email from them with a coupon code. I tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work. I emailed their CS and they told me that the coupon was working. Come to find out, they misspelled the coupon on the email. The code contained the word ""cuisine"" and they misspelled it. I emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction. Very disappointing indeed...<br /><br />In the future, if I find another brand that did not contain menadione and had better customer service, and I would instantly switch over to the new brand.

If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!",Yummy G/F Alternative!,4

"While the product was as expected as I had ordered it before in smaller packaged quantities, the larger volume bag ordered arrived in an Amazon box opened and out of the sack.  The contents were spilling out of the carton even as I picked it up and loaded it unto my car.  I left a little trail of kibbles as I finally arrived home.  That was my only complaint and as I did not think the product itself was compromised I simply kept it rather than go through the process of returning the item.  My dogs of course love it so, the cost is much better than purchasing from the pet store and the convenience of having it shipped to my PO box is nice.  Next time though perhaps I should have it delivered to my home residence. Will definitely order again but will probably order in smaller bags so as to avoid the ""opened"" bag experience.",Product was as expected.  Arrival condition of product was poor.,4

My kids really like juice and this has great flavor but even though it is 100% juice it is a little intense on the sweet side as it is made with juice and concentrates.

"I am a devotee of freshly made espresso coffee every morning which I make at home with a vacuum espresso pot. The results are a very full-bodied, strong coffee(I use Costco's Kirkland brand Columbian Supremo) that I add just hot water and half and half to. Similar to a double shot Cafe Americano at an espresso bar.<br /><br />I am absolutely NOT a fan of Starbuck's overpriced and over roasted coffee. I also despise coffeemaker Folgers coffee, if I can avoid it! And other instant coffee tastes bitter and watery to me.<br /><br />However, these little packets are quick, pack anywhere--like a purse, glovebox or suitcase--and make a fascinatingly GOOD cup of coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, on the strong side but no ""Burnt"" taste, and close to freshly brewed coffee as -- sheesh, it tastes like a fresh brewed cup. I am impressed. I add water and my half and half and it's better than good. I love Columbian coffee and this is the flavor I hoped for.<br /><br />Starbucks has done this right!<br /><br />The Downside: The cost is really an issue. I paid $5+ at Starbucks for a 3 pack. Then I got a 3 pack at Walmart recently for $2.99. This offer gets you more for about 80 cents each, but for instant? So I give the VIA coffee a 4 star rating even at the cheaper price.<br /><br />The quality is there though, so I plan to get some for my business trips out of town (no more running out for an expensive espresso) or as a backup in my purse. But I still use my espresso maker for my everyday cup.","Surprisingly Fresh, Rich Coffee Taste for Instant, but Pricey",4

"What can I say, since I haven't tried it myself? The fat one likes it way too much and the skinny one doesn't like it enough. If I could find a food that produced the opposite effect, I would be pretty happy.

"I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)","Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg",4

"We love these bars because they are low sugar and high protein for a reasonable amount of calories. However, some of the bars seem to be old or dried out, and one bar was very strange looking with spots all over it. I couldn't find an easy way to get a partial refund or replacement of only one out of ten bars, so that one bar was simply a waste of money. The product itself is excellent, but we're unsure whether we ultimately save money by buying it from Amazon when we may randomly have to throw away bad bars.<br /><br />Bottom line: awesome product, but there are some issues with quality control.","Great flavor with lots of protein, but there is one problem...",4

"Considering I've tried many different types of ice creams, gelatos, and frozen yogurts, I had high hopes for Arctic Zero. My creamy, cold, partially frozen desserts have got to taste good, melt in the mouth, and satisfy the craving appropriately.<br />Don't expect Ben & Jerry's or full-fat quality from this ice cream. By reading the ingredients alone, there's no magical spell that can transform monk fruit, water, and whey protein into egg yolks, granulated sugar, and cream.<br /><br />Arctic Zero's Cookies and Cream ice cream is a smooth and slightly slippery textured sweet treat. My first experience with monk fruit was in this ice cream and I've got to say it has a nicely sweet flavor to it without the cooling effects of artificial sweeteners. Taste is great, in my opinion! It definitely reminded me of a watered down cookies and cream flavor. There is no texture or cookie bits in here, though.<br /><br />The color is a slightly off grey, purple hue. I really liked it. If you've ever had taro flavored milk or bubble tea, it looks just like that. It also tastes similar to taro bubble tea. Maybe this is why I enjoy it so much!<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a shot to try in the grocery store before you go buying a mega pack. You will either love it or leave it.

As someone who grows his own mint leaves and fancies himself a mojito connoisseur, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this product.

In fact, it is somewhat interesting how boring companies like Kraft and P&G can invent new products to entice consumers to spend their money - even on products that have no caloric or nutritional value.

"I have two maltese dogs, a male who is 13 and a female who is 11.  The female will eat nearly anything that doesn't try to eat her first.  The male will hardly eat at all unless you beg him.  Both of them liked the grilled sirloin part pretty well.  The ""potato and green bean garnish"" part tended to stay in the bowl a while, though my little girl would eventually eat that, too, usually.  Dogs are not fans of veggies of any kind and so I was not surprised.  But overall, they liked it pretty well, which is saying a lot for what is mostly a dry dog food.  I have not seen this in the store where I buy my dog food.  When it does (and if it does) the price will determine for me whether I'll start buying this brand or stay with the brand I was already using.

"I bought this for my last birthday, thanks to a gift card I was sent.  I should say that for it's price, this is a perfectly decent brand of white truffle oil.  I use it for making omelets, sauteing vegetables and even as an ingredient for salad dressings.  If you like a garlicky white truffle flavor, this is a good brand and can even make a good gift, depending upon your budget.<br /><br />There is a bit of confusion.  When I read about this on-line, it says it is an infusion.  Other places both on-line and by the manufacturers say it is ""truffle-essence.""  There is a world of difference between these two things.  An infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils, truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil.  An ""essence"", on the other hand, generally means it's been made to taste of white-truffles, perhaps even using very synthetic methods.

"I love cheez-Its from the get go but these mozzarella cheese ones are truly scrumptious.  They claim they are creamy...... and they really are creamy tasting.  From the first cracker in your mouth you think 'creamy'.  Sooo DELICIOUS!  There is 180 mg of sodium per each of 13 servings/box at 25 crackers per serving.  They do have 7 grams of fat/serving but no trans fats.  From a diabetic point of view, the 19 grams of carbohydrates and 150 calories/serving is a lot even with zero sugars and 3 grams of protein per serving.  I try to restrict my consumption to one or two serving each time I grab the box for a snack but I have to admit this is really hard to do.  They just taste so darn great!  If I have a complaint, the only one I have is that this product contains monosodium glutamate, MSG.  I am highly allergic to this well known neurotoxin and MUST be very careful with my intake of this dangerous chemical.  It is on the very bottom of the ingredients list so hopefully there is not a hugh amount of it in these crackers.  Since I just ate them, I'll know if there is too much MSG if I develop a headache and lock jaw type symptoms tomorrow.  Makes me wonder WHY put it into this delicious snack in the first place?  I do highly recommend this scrumptious treat if you can tolerate the MSG.  I'll have to limit my intake due to the MSG.",These are great.,4

"""Bounty"" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. You can easily buy them ""over the counter"" here in Australia. But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!<br /><br />Theo.",Melt in Your Mouth Delicious!,4

"This is the first time that I have purchased Haribo Gummi bears and they are chewier and the taste is more subtle than other gummi bears with which I was familiar.  However, they quickly become addictive and that is why a 5 lb bag would spell disaster for me because I would be unable to stop eating them.  I like the fact that the gummi bears are chewier because it slows me down.  Initially I ate several gummi bears at one time and it was hard to distinguish the different flavors.  I currently find the taste to be more distinctive if I eat the same flavor at one time.<br /><br />I will buy Haibo gummy bears again because I like the consistency and taste which I think is more subtle than others that I have tried.",12 Pack Order Helps to Limit My Intake,4

"I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).

"I got a sample of the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix, and I truly enjoyed it.  It easily dissolves in hot water and it has a very soothing scent.  You can definitely taste the ginger, but it's offset by the lemon and honey blend.  Although ginger, lemon and honey are considered healthy ingredients and may have medicinal qualities, this is not a diet drink.  According to the label, there are 73 calories per serving, so please keep this in mind.  However, it is caffeine free, so it would make an ideal evening drink alone or with a dash of milk.

The reason I'm holding back a star is because two out of three of my dogs -- my greyhound and my sheltie -- are seniors and this is a harder treat than is really comfortable for them and the treats are hard to break into pieces. (Soaking in water for a couple minutes seems to help.) Some dogs genetically have really made tartar prone teeth and that's these two and there have been extractions over the years.

Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here.

"When I first tried this coffee it had a dark, rich, overly strong flavor and color. In fact it was a bit bitter and was definately not a blend I would recommend. I decided to work with the amount used for each pot and ultimately ended up using less than recommended and it turned out to be very good. I like my coffee black but not bitter or unduly strong and usually use Starbuck's or Seattle's Best French Roast. I still prefer them over this brand but would definately buy a bag of this without hesitation. It had a very low acidity content and even after being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it's flavor and aroma. If you like a strong, rich blend this is the coffee for you. By using the recommended amount you will end up with a strong, rich, flavorful cup of very good coffee. The fine grind is a nice touch and gives one the feeling that all of the ground beans are being used. Definately a vast improvement over the usual store varieties.

"This switch kiwi berry tasts like the Red-Bull energy drink...bit of sour and sweet but not too much sparkling gas. The overall taste is not bad (I like it), but I could not taste the kiwi or berry. If you are looking for kiwi or berry taste, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The label says no suger added, but the ingredient table shows 33g sugar? I guess the sugar all comes from the 100% juice itself. So much suger level is such a small can. That's kind of high...<br /><br />Overall, I like the taste and I think it's an enjoyable drink. But I won't recommend it due to the high suger level.","Nice taste, but sugar level is high",4
"The pasta is fine, tastes very good and the package is plenty for 5-6 people.  The problems I have are A) one of the bags arrived with a tear and some of the pasta was spilled inside the box and B) package says cooks in 3 minutes but that is NOT true. It takes about 10 minutes unless you like your pasta REALLY firm. The quick cooking was a major part of the reason I made this purchase so that, combined with the torn bag are the reasons I won't purchase again.",Not quite as advertised,4

"Overall, Switch tastes just fine but the predominate flavor is really apple juice. In fact, the smell of apples greats your nose from the moment you take your fist taste. While the product seems to be a rather good one, especially since it consists of real fruit juices that that been carbonated, it fails on the account that it really does not taste like black cherry. The cost of this product (at nearly $1 for an 8.3 fluid ounce can) is also prohibitive. At this time, I can see myself purchasing it as it is far more economical to buy other fruit juices.",Tastes like apple juice,4

"Usually when I think of nuts and chocolate together, I imagine the typical chocolate-dipped candy that happens to have a nut inside.  These Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds were a surprise departure from the ""candy"" path.  The nuts are dusted with a fine layer of dark chocolate power, meaning that the almond flavor is primary with a subtle chocolate background.  As a person who loves both those flavors, I felt like I was getting the best of both worlds...  a healthy snack that had a bit more ""zing"" than the typical offering.<br /><br />If I were in the mood for something to munch on without resorting to candy, this would be something I'd now consider as a possibility.  Another nice feature is the packaging...  the lid measures out a serving when you use it as the ""bowl"" for the nuts.  That goes a long ways towards avoiding the typical over-estimation of portion size.<br /><br />Good flavor, helpful packaging...  This probably won't be my last purchase of these almonds.",mmmmm....  chocolate....  almonds...,4

"Four out of four cats will eat it, as long as it's not for every meal. Kitty with kidney disease doesn't mind it, but won't eat it consistently. The fact that he'll eat it at all is amazing, because he wouldn't touch any of the vet diets. From can to can it's a little inconsistent in terms of moisture content - cats all definitely prefer the cans that are more moist, have a little extra juice. I'll buy it again.",kitty food,4
"I love trying Kashi products because they are attentive to whole grains, low sugar, etc.  This product has 12 grams of protein and is less like candy than other nutrition bars, which I appreciate. It is, however, sweet enough that it is a pleasure to eat. I am surprised that what I am asked to review is called a Turtle Bar; I just re-read the description and what I got was definitely not the Turtle bar because the center was vanilla and not chocolate.  I don't really care because I was looking for a tasty Kashi product, hoping for something less sugary than other meal replacement bars and these goals were met. I will be trying other flavors anyway.  One caution: this bar requires a good set of teeth to eat--lots of crunch and chew (which make it more satisfying, in my opinion).  If you like Kashi products in general, you will probably like this one.","GOLEAN roll bar, over a dollar each but very good",4

I have been searching for a nice strong coffee for my Keurig that doesn't leave a bitter or flat aftertaste.  This a very nice bold flavored coffee that seems to fit the bill.  I am a bit spoiled after tasting Barista Prima's Italian roast as it has such a nice rich full-bodied flavor.  It is a bit pricier so the Double Black Diamond is a nice close second at a more affordable price.  I like my coffee black or with a little milk and this does not leave you wondering where the coffee went!,Nice Bold Flavor,4

"Nature's Path Organic Love Crunch is a rolled-oat granola with little chunks of dark chocolate and bits of freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  The quality of the ingredients is very good so it does tastes fresh and it is quite crunchy.<br /><br />My primary criticism is that it is much too sweet to eat for breakfast:  it even turns the milk sweet and gives it a slight chocolate flavor.  This granola is much better eaten dry as a dessert.  It would also be good as a topping for apple crisp.<br /><br />The suggested serving size of 1/4 cup has 140 calories and I would think a normal serving would be much larger than that, possibly a full cup or 560 calories. About half the bag arrived in tiny pieces from shipping so even the suggested quarter cup would probably contain more calories and it is not low-fat, either.  3/4 cup has 27% of the suggested daily value for fat.<br /><br />Note:  ""evaporated cane juice"" is better known as ""sugar"".<br /><br />Ingredients:  Rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, soy oil, spelt, dark chocolate chunks (evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, vanilla), flax seed, dried coconut, cocoa, freeze dried berry blend (freeze-dried strawberries, freeze-dried raspberries), rice starch, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, tocopherols (natural vitamin E).<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving size 1/4 cup (30g)<br />Servings per container:  about 10 (total in package is 11.5 oz or 325 g)<br /><br />Per serving:<br />Calories - 140<br />Calories from fat - 55<br />Total fat - 6 g<br />Saturated fat - 1g<br />Trans fat - 0 g<br />Polyunsaturated fat - 3 g<br />Monounsaturated fat - 15 g<br />Cholesterol - 0 mg<br />Sodium - 55 mg<br />Potassium - 105 mg<br />Total carbohydrates - 20 g<br />Dietary fiber - 2 g<br />Sugars - 6 g<br />Protein - 2 g<br />Vitamin A - 0%<br />Vitamin C - 2%<br />Calcium - 0%<br />Iron - 4%","Good quality, tasty, but too sweet for breakfast",4

"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Banana Bread Bar as part of my Influenster Summer Beauty Vox Box. I'm staunchly anti-banana, but this little treat sounded right up my mum's alley, so I had her eat it. This is what she thought. Keep in mind, Mum is already a big Quaker fan, and an even bigger fan of banana nut bread. She had Quaker oats for breakfast this morning actually. As prompted by the directions, she microwaved it for 10 seconds. She liked the packaging, since you could see the product, it had a full ingredient list, and plenty of nutritional information. The bar is 1.48oz (42g).Mum's initial thoughts were that the bar seemed to have decent nutritional value, and would make a convenient lunch time/after work snack. When she took her first bite, she seemed really impressed that it tasted ""like real banana nut bread!"", and said it had a crunchy but chewy texture with lots of almonds. She said the banana and nut flavors were well balanced.  She really liked it, she ate it super fast (she always yells at me about eating too fast ;_;). She saved tiny morsels of it for both our dogs, who agreed it was delicious.Overall, Mum really liked this Quaker bar. She said she'll probably buy a box of them next time she goes to the grocery store (provided she can find a coupon). She thinks full price ($3.30 MSRP for 6 bars) is reasonable, but like me, she kinda loves saving money. Her only complaint about Quaker's Soft Baked Banana Nut Bread Bar is that it contains corn syrup, aside from that, it was a hit. She gave it a 4/5.","Good Texture, Balanced Flavors.",4

"While this isn't the best ever curry mix available, it IS pretty good. What makes it worth buying is the simplicity. You literally just boil the bag in a pot of water, cut it open and pour it over cooked rice (or noodles) and you're done. Instant curry dinner for one. (or two if you are just snacking) The box is marked ""Hot"" and it's got a decent level of spice or heat, but it's not hot by my standards, if you're looking for fire breathing hot curry, you'll want to add some spices of your own and do some doctoring here. But again, for a quick curry fix or snack, it'll work fine. There are some small carrots & potatoes in the packet already & they are ok, totally edible. I usually cook a small lamb chop or pork chop to add to the rice for a full meal after a busy day - makes a nice enough cold weather meal with a favorite movie type of thing.","Nice flavor, single serving, super easy to cook",4

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was how it arrived--most of the cookies in the box were crumbled, which would probably make a good ice cream topping.  Still, I would have preferred if they arrived intact.",Tastes like caramel...and cream!,4

The protein count is 28%, fat 16% and fiber 3%.<br /><br />Beef is the first ingredient, then soybean meal, soy flour and soy protein are all ingredients that are appropriate protein.  Brewers rice is the small pieces left over after the husk is milled.  Questionable ingredients include animal fat, which could come from anywhere, corn and corn gluten meal, poultry by products, the parts of poultry that are unfit for human consumption, and animal digest, again parts of any animal that is unfit for human consumption.  They also added food coloring, food dye.<br /><br />My dog is spoiled.  Her food is kept in a container in the pantry and anytime she gets hungry she goes in and paws the container to tell me that she is hungry.  With this food she has been asking for extra servings of food.  It isn't good to switch a dog to a new food so I mixed it with her regular food, but she loves it. She has had other soft type food and has not has this reaction to it.<br /><br />I keep my dog on a natural dog food without the questionable ingredients that Chef Michael's contains so I will not change to this full time, but I will include it for a treat now and then.",The dog says it is delicious!,4

"Schar gluten free bread is one of my favorites. I usually alternate between this and Udi's bread. Schar has a great taste and a pretty good texture. It doesn't need to be toasted in order to be enjoyable. I like this bread for sandwiches. The only minor downside is that like most gluten free bread items, Schar is a bit crumbly and can fall apart easily. Many times there is one piece in the bag (which I buy from a grocery store, not Amazon) that is broken. Udi's has managed to avoid the crumbly texture, but for sandwiches and untoasted uses I generally prefer Schar.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon (6 packages for $48) isn't great. Even the more expensive store around me has it for a little less than that. I'd generally  expect to pay $5 per package, not $8. Although if you are rich or you simply can't get gluten free bread anywhere near you, Schar is a good choice.",One of my two favorite gluten free breads.,4
"I usually drink Crystal Light and my favorites tend to be the simple flavors. This was neither and that was good.<br /><br />First off, it is 10 calories per packet - it says 5 calories per 8oz serving size but there are 2 servings per packet and it is intended for a regular 16.9 fluid oz bottle of water and I really dislike when marketing tries to get all tricky like that.<br /><br />Adding the dry contents of the packet to my bottle of water I was initially worried because it was taking longer to dissolve than I was used to with the Crystal Light packets and I was worried I was going to have little gritty stuff at the bottom of my bottle - Didn't happen.  All the ""grit"" dissolved perfectly - it just took a minute longer.<br /><br />The taste initially was too sweet and I got immediately the taste of pineapple and mango (I had just sipped the plain water though and almost anything after plain water is too sweet).  My second and third sips were much more to my liking.  I still got the mango and pineapple sweetness right away but the taste after that was more mellow with the hints of honey and green tea.  I normally don't like green tea but the sweetness of the pineapple and mango and honey really lessened the bitter taste I sometimes get with green tea.<br /><br />All in all I really liked the smooth taste of it.",Mango Pineapple Honey Green Tea,4

I guess this is the proverbial tempest in a teacup.<br /><br />In any case, I like this jasmine tea.  It's not too perfumed, and does have a smooth taste.  No snails.  But . . . wait!

"I have 2 dogs: a rescue greyhound and a rescue pit mix.  The pit mix has very strong jaws and is a heavy, strong chewer.  The greyhound is, like all greyhounds, weak-jawed.  My pit mix can manage these hard treats, but the greyhound was not able to chew through to get to the peanut butter center, and eventually the mix stole it from him.<br /><br />These are rawhide chews with a peanut butter 'flavored' center.  Why they don't use real peanut butter is beyond me.  They claim to be good for the teeth, which I assume is true since they take a lot of chewing.  They also claim to be good for the digestion.  I don't know if this is what is meant but they seem to go right through my dog.  (Not a good thing in my book... I can't give her one when she is home alone.)<br /><br />I don't downgrade because my greyhound can't manage them; that's a greyhound thing.  But I do downgrade because they are flavored artificially and because they give my dog the runs.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Dogs think they're tasty, but the weak chewer can't manage them.  Artificial flavors.  Seem to go right through the dog that can manage them.",Good for strong chewers,4

"This is the second Kraft Velveeta Skillets Dinner Kit we've tried and we found it surprisingly good. The pasta is orzo, which if you're not familiar with it is the size and shape of rice. The kit comes with the pasta, a flavor packet and cheese sauce. The cheese is your standard Velveeta and the flavor packet has a mild broccoli flavor. Like rice, orzo tends to pick up the flavors around it. Also like rice, orzo is easy to over cook, so pay attention to the instructions and the stage your pasta is at. These are mild flavors and smooth consistencies, which may make them appropriate for children as an introduction to broccoli. We enjoyed it quite a bit.",Liked it More Than We Thought We Would,4

"When these came home, I was less skeptical about what I was getting. The name says it all, oat, coconut and chocolate, in a bar form. Sounds more like a cookie to me. Tasted a lot more like a cookie than a bar that was healthy for me. Which is good. I want to taste my food and know it's healthy, than not want to taste my food while knowing it's healthy. There was plenty of chocolate in the bar for me and it wasn't concentrated in chunk or random chips. The chocolate pieces used had melted nicely, so the chocolate was very prevalent throughout.<br /><br />I definitely could taste the coconut, but it was a more fresh flavor than say something you'd buy in a bag at a store. It also did not overpower the rest of the bar. Coconut is a powerful ingredient. It's good to know it was used in moderation. The oats and the cookie part of the bar lend well into reminding me of a great oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I could take a bite and got plenty of the cookie texture I want more of, with bits of oat and smaller but still flavorful coconut.<br /><br />I think it'd work well to think of these less as a bar (like a healthy food bar) and more of a great tasting, small cookie.",Reminds me of a cookie,4

"Tootsie roll pops, the first lollipop with a chewy center, were born in 1931 at the Sweets Company of America. The company changed its name to Tootsie Roll Industries in 1966. Tootsie Roll Pops are the number one selling lollipop. Bought singly or by the bag, one might pay from 16 to 20 cents for a single pop. The cost conscious consumer buying them by the box of 100 will pay 8 cents or less per pop.<br /><br />A .6 ounce tootsie roll pop has 60 calories, no fat, no cholesterol, no protein,15g of carbs, 10g of sugar, and no vitamins. It's a low calorie way to get that sugar fix if the consumer limits himself/herself to one or two pops. Pops last much longer than a chocolate bar without the high fat and calorie count.<br /><br />Mrs. Spudman is almost addicted to these confections. I buy them by the box of 100 at BJ's. She takes out the flavors she likes and gives the rest to me to enjoy for myself or take to work for the students. (I just bit into the center. Just couldn't help myself.)<br /><br />They are a popular commodity and disappear quickly although I've noticed that the ones in the green wrappers are always the last to go.<br />I like that they last so long and satisfy my sugar cravings. Also I can pop one in my mouth and continue to type or do whatever with my hands free, only occasionally taking the pop out of my mouth to check on its progress or diminishing shell.<br /><br />The price for a box of pops here is a bit high, but consider that it is being delivered to your door.",Pops are Tops,4

"I'm always in the market for new product that will add volume without weight to my not-so-fine fine hair.  After reading multiple reviews on this shampoo, I was a little worried that I was in for yet another disappointing, weighted-down hair experience.  What a pleasure then to note on first use that it not only supplied more body but was helpful in controlling those unfortunate waves that develop with age.<br /><br />I think this shampoo builds up over time; I get good results with occasional use, but regular use makes for a sorry, drowned-rat effect. Interesting though, while humidity (of which we have little here in Denver) is my hair's worst enemy, rain on a Clear Scalp shampoo day did not raise that dreaded halo of frizz.","Mixed results for fine, thin hair",4

Just mix some into your coffee to get started until your drinking just teeccino.The stuff tastes great - similar to but better than coffee. They say that it's actually good for you.

"These tortilla chips have an ""all-natural"" feel to them, and a somewhat unique taste, which is both good and bad.<br /><br />First off, I'll just comment on the packaging.  The singular bag is made of a relatively thick foil-like material and is air puffed tightly.  The result is freshly crisp, unbroken chips in the bag.  A nice bonus and much better than standard lunch-sized chip bags you find from most common companies.<br /><br />As for the taste of the chips, they're pretty good.  I liked the olive and garlic flavor when I was eating them by themselves.  However, when I paired them with some salsa, the olive taste didn't match up that well.  They might go better with a french onion chip dip instead (though I didn't try that).<br /><br />So if you want fresh, never-broken tortilla chips to eat just by themselves with no dip, these do rather well.  If you're looking for a chip to go with your bowl of salsa, you may want go elsewhere.","Interesting chip, but maybe not the best for salsa",4
"To be honest, I expected this to taste terrible, so I was pleasantly surprised when I cracked open the can after leaving it in my fridge overnight and shaking it well before opening it, that it did indeed taste like a slightly melted vanilla shake.<br /><br />I work out 3-4 times a week and find on those days after working out that I will be hungry quite quickly as my metabolism is set on high for hours afterwards, but I don't want to over eat. I could see this shake as a great option for those times. While I was only given one sample can to try, so can't attest to long term effectiveness, I can say that it is a tasty, filling shake, (it should be for 370 Calories) that would be a good option for someone to consume after working out or playing a fast paced sport.","Make My Protein Shaken, Not Stirred",4

"The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.",Looks like good stuff!,4

"Yum, I loved those chocolate covered marshmallow cookies. I have a weakness when it comes to chocolate :)<br /><br />I especially love that those cookies are covered with tasty and sweet- but not too sweet- chocolate. Once you bite into the cookie, you'll get to the soft marshmallow center and a tasty cookie bottom.I really enjoyed these chocolate marshmallow cookies. Yesterday I was hoping that they would arrive, so that I could also give some of them out on Halloween. But when they arrived today and I tasted them, I changed my mind! I'm keeping them for me, and only sharing them with family... or better yet I'm hiding them in the fridge then I'll get to enjoy them for the whole week lol.<br /><br />On another note: Health wise, every two cookies (which is the size of a serving) has: 120 calories, 5 g fat, 18 g carbohydrates, and 12 g sugar. So be careful not to eat a lot of those.<br /><br />In the end, these are very tasty, I liked them a lot. But I do think that they are a bit expensive.",Chocolate Delight,4

"I bought this for my 3 month old puppy, thinking it would keep her busy and entertained. It took her about 20 minutes to figure out that she could lay in her bed with the bottle tilted against the side, and the food would keep coming out if she just moved it periodically. I ended up giving the toy away because she was able to be too lazy with it. I gave the toy 4 stars, though, because I doubt this would happen with most dogs. Quite frankly it shocked the heck out of me when I saw what she was doing.","I liked the design, but my pup's too smart for it",4

"My cat enjoys these, and buying them off Amazon saves money, but I've noted she's less enthusiastic about this flavor, and she'll only eat it if we're out of every other treat and she's completely desperate not to eat her regular food.  It's not just my cat either; my friend's cat doesn't like them as much as the ones in the orange or blue bags.

"These cookies are very good.  I bought them as a gluten-free substitute for vanilla wafers in banana pudding.  My daughter, who does not need to eat gluten-free, commented that she likes these better than vanilla wafers for that recipe-they don't get all soggy when the pudding is refrigerated overnight. I had been looking for a gluten free cookie for this banana pudding recipe for awhile and was very pleased with the result.  My husband thought they were great too.  I would have rated these a 5 star, except Amazon did not package them well and every single cookie was broken in shipping.  They refunded my payment promptly when I reported the problem, though.",Tasty!,4

"This toy has worked out well for our dog!  We try to buy interesting and safe toys for us to give her while we're at work. It's tough and has withstood our large Bernese Mountain dog puppy chewing at the neck of it and throwing it around the room. It took her a few days to figure it out.  I had to show her how to use it, and she seemed uninterested, but then I left it in her crate with her, and when I came home later it was empty.  Since then, she's a pro at it.  The rope didn't last that long, but we just took the rope out and use larger treats with it, and it's still a challenge for her.  Our last thing that we tried in it was baby carrots - she loved it and it took her a good 30 minutes to get them out.",Good food toy for the rotation,4

"Roland's chicken-flavor Noodles Cup is one of the best instant noodle products I've eaten. What makes it so good is the savory taste the chicken flavor packet imparts to the noodles. Additionally, I like it because it contains a minimum of ingredients. The only remotely ""controversial"" components are yeast extract and hydrolyzed soy protein, which some people have likened to MSG, as they are chemically similar. They add great flavor, though.<br /><br />I would like to point out that when I make these, I never use the little packet of dried vegetables. They don't rehydrate very well. However, the ramen is excellent without them.<br /><br />Additionally, Amazon has a great deal on this 12-pack; it's definitely less than I would pay for 12 of these in a store.",Roland: King among noodle cups,4

"Switch certainly lives up to its name - it is definitely a switch from your normal drinks. Packaged like an energy drink, the Kiwi Berry Switch almost has the texture of a soda, and almost tastes like a sweetened fruit juice. Its a little of both, and actually manages to pull it off.<br /><br />Some people might find the drink a bit too sweet, but I found that the excessive sweetness wasn't accompanied by a lingering aftertaste, or a sticky, sugary residue that just makes you thirstier. It actually is quite refreshing, which is remarkable for a drink which almost tastes like liquid candy.<br /><br />The kiwi part of this kiwi berry drink it almost nonexistent, but the berry flavor almost makes you forget this. The size of the can is the perfect portion size for a drink of this nature; you wouldn't want to drink too much of this in one sitting. But the serving size is perfect for a taste of something sweet and refreshing.",Like a cross between a soda and a juice box...,4

"I ordered this since my pediatrician recommended carrots and peas for my 7 month old who has been having rice cereal and bananas for a couple of months now. We tried the carrots and my baby loved it so much he finished about 3/4th of the 2 oz jar. However carrots are constipating and I had to give him 6 oz of apple juice mixed with water a day to relieve the constipation. Lesson learnt- when introducing new foods-especially rice cereal, not very ripe bananas and carrots, start with only about a tablespoon and then move up slowly.According to what it says on the jar, once opened it can be stored in the fridge for 3 days.<br />I like that Earth's best is supposed to be organic and not genetically modified food.

I love Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shampoo because it feels great (the Tea Tree oil in it is refreshing), and I like Fructius's anti-dandruff product.  The Clean Men Scalp Therapy really works well in reducing dandruff and leaves my hair really clean and manageable.  It has a luxurious feel to it.  My only negative is that the label claims that it has mint, but you wouldn't know it.  You can't smell it or feel it when shampooing. I'm not sure exactly what makes this a man's shampoo.  My wife likes it as much as I do. Of the bazillion shampoos on the market this is one that, in my opinion, stands out as one of the best.",It Works--No More Dandruff,4

I added a tiny bit of sugar once I stirred the packet into boiling water. The ginger scent was divine and the subtle taste of honey was there too. The drink went down easily but the ginger was a bit overwhelming and could be a little less spicy. I would love to have had this drink when I was pregnant as it would probably help with morning sickness and it would also be great when you are nauseated or ill.  The kids tried it and the ginger taste was overwhelming to them so maybe adjust that in future blends.  I would buy it in addition to tea to keep on hand for the flu or when solids won't stay down.  I read that another reviewer added it to green tea and I tried it and it cut the spiciness of the ginger and made it smoother to drink.,Perfect drink for nausea or upset stomach,4

Very good product from Bajaj. It takes only 3 to 5 minutes to fully heat the 15 litre water. Capacity is also ok for small families. Only drawbacks are-1) Bajaj didn't provide the connecting heat resistance pipe with the geyser.2) Bajaj also didn't provide the wall mounting bolts.3) Installation was not free.

"I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Chipotle which I am reviewing now, and also the Jalape&ntilde;o and the Spicy Ranchero sauces.<br /><br />The Chipotle is my second favorite of the three. (I like the Spicy Ranchero the best). It definitely has a distinct smokey peppery chipotle taste to it, with of course the creamy base.  This sauce goes well on taco salads and (as I used it on) beef burritos.  I suppose you could use it for french fries or tacos as well.  I felt that because the sauce had such a bold flavor that probably its uses would be more limited than the Spicy Ranchero flavor that was much more mild and subdued.  But if you like a bold chipotle flavor I think this would really be for you.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle.  You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top.  Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings.",2nd favorite of the new Taco Bell sauces,4

"This a light-medium roast mild flavored everyday morning coffee.  I bought it because the special offer price was too good to refuse and am pleased that the taste is acceptable.  I would compare it with the store brand of ground coffee from our local Food City supermarket.  Many of the more famous brands of coffee (like Starbucks or Gevalia) are too bitter for my taste.<br /><br />I have been using 3 coffee scoops (the scoop that comes in the can of ground coffee) per 7 cup pot of water.  A lot of people would prefer a stronger flavor using more coffee and/or less water. If you want a really robust coffee (that's silly - robust coffee drinkers don't buy decaf do they?) this is not for you.  If you want a ""gentle"" pleasant cup of coffee, try this brand.<br /><br />I would not pay more for this brand, but if it goes on sale again at the special offer price I would purchase it again.  At a higher per bag price I will go back to purchasing fair trade organic brands.",Fine for everyday morning coffee,4

"Apparently, I have been raised on the generic version of Mallomars, because this is the first time I have tried Mallomars.  At first look, I did notice they were smaller -- maybe about the size of the covered oreo cookies.  The marshmallow doesn't taste as sweet as the generic I've eaten for years and the cookie part seemed to crumble every time I would take a bite. So, I either dealt with the messy crumbs or shoved the whole cookie in my mouth at one time.  As an adult, when I splurge and eat cookies, I want to savor them and make them last longer, so I prefer not to put the whole thing in my mouth.  All that said, the chocolate on the Mallomars is out of this world!!!  It is fantastic!!!  I think the goodness of the chocolate almost completely counteracts the crumbly cookie.

"I bought this unit as an upgrade a month ago, to replace my manual Breville machine. From the get go this machine performed very well. In the short time between my Brevilles design, purchase and my subsequent use, the tech has come a long way to ""more affordable."" this machine is great for those who don't want to have to do all the work and have an extra grinder appliance on the side.<br />This machine pulls great shots, with a fully adjustable grind and volume controls to tweak the shots to your preference. On a whole the machine is quite easy to control and seems to require very little upkeep at present.<br />You'll read that the unit can seem to have a cheap feel due to the use of plastic just about everywhere, and this is true. It's the trade off I think for getting such a good unit for such a low cost. I recommend this unit for anyone looking to upgrade that has some cash but don't feel like breaking the bank.",A great product,4

I didn't add anything to it, because the flavor was nice as it was, without sugar or honey.<br /><br />Be aware that this is the flavor of fresh ginger, kind of hot and spicy, and not sweet like gingerbread.  Just saying, because if you're not used to the heat, it might take some getting used to.  I drink fresh ginger tea when I have a cold or fever, and I know it has many other medicinal benefits.  There is a light taste of lemon.<br /><br />I will drink this again, and recommend it if you like fresh ginger teas.","Good drink!  (fresh spicy ginger taste, not sweet )",4

"These dog treats are great motivators. At first the price seems high, but they last a long time because only a few need to be used in each training session.

"subscribed to receive 2 bags of this coffee @ regular intervals. pleasantly surprised. it's not the best coffee i've ever had by a long shot, but is quite drinkable. definitely much better than expected. for the subscription price, i think it's a good value. two bags delivered for the price of one bag of starbucks in many stores. if you're looking for a good coffee that will help cut what you spend if you're buying starbucks, peets, etc. try this deal.",good subscription deal,4

"This is a great tea. Loose leaf tea is to tea what whole bean is to coffee. The first thing I noticed upon opening the can was the aroma. It was rich and full. The tea is wonderfully dried with consistently large pieces with some white tips evenly dispersed.<br /><br />The tea steeps nicely with wonderful, but not overpowering, flavor with only slight hints of bitterness often found in Earl Grey. The Bergamot was not too strong and added nicely to this great cup of tea.",Great tea! Wonderful flavor,4
"I never buy pre-ground coffee, we grind our own; however, I was tempted by the ""low acid"" offer, since I often have heart burn when I drink coffee.  I was extremely surprised with how GOOD this coffee tasted. Seriously, I had very low expectations, and I was blown away not only by the fact that I had less heart burn, but the taste was great!  It not only didn't taste like ""low acid"" coffee, it didn't taste pre-ground.  That said, I was reviewing the prices for the low acid coffee, and it is waaay expensive.  Not sure I'll be buying it - probably just stick to my big mug of sweet tea.  If you can't leave coffee alone and you have heart burn, however, go ahead and try it.  Recommended for taste and low acid, not for cost.","Excellent, truly is low acid!",4

"These pearls have been good in the past for use in tapioca pudding (which goes really fast in our house) They are easy to soak and simple to use.<br /><br />The problem is the recipe calls for the egg to be used in a manner that most will find gets them ""chickeny"" smelling tapioca pudding when the finished product is finally cold.

"I am a mom concerned about BPA and wanted to find something I could safely use in the freezer, and found this one among others and I liked that this one came with a lid and they style of it is pretty cool.

When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.

"Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids.

"Guayaki organic yerba mate' was the first organic mate' I ever purchased. The flagship label in the Guayaki line is their traditional ""yellow"" organic label, which is ok but has about 25% stems, seeds, and whole leaves. I like this San Mateo Guayaki organic ""green"" label better. It is, at least to my taste, a fuller flavor than the standard Guayaki. As of 5/28/11, it is substantially cheaper than the standard Guayaki label. The San Mateo label also seems to show less yerba stems and seeds. The reason I deducted one star is the presence of (even still) too many stems and seeds as well as the uncompetitive price. Guayaki badly needs to filter their Yerba leaves in their existing products or offer a different label with pure, refined leaf. Other yerba mate' vendors offer this and it is a gaping hole in Guayaki's product line. Even though this product is more affordable than the rest of the Guayaki yerba mate' line, it is still very expensive compared to other organic and traditional yerba mate' labels from other companies. An adjustment to competitive pricing as well as attention to filtering the yerba leaves would give this product 5 stars.","Better than the standard ""Yellow"" Guayaki",4

So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS.

"The best feature about this dog food is that dogs (I have four) find it especially palatable. When it arrived, they sniffed the unopened package and would not leave its side. When it was finally offered to them (as a test for this review, of course), they were quite excited and gave it thumbs up. Note there is a package warning to mix it with old food over a number of days for an adjustment period).<br /><br />What's to like: The pieces are semi-soft and come in various shapes so they are closer to dogs' natural food in the wild. The drawback is that the semi-soft pieces will not contribute to teeth cleaning as does hard. But the dogs certainly find it more appealing and it makes their mealtime more enjoyable.<br /><br />(As I write this review, the dogs have gather round my computer as I placed the bag on the desk for referral purposes. Hope I can get through writing this piece without too much commmotion and distraction!)<br /><br />Some of the ingredients are nice: especially the vegetables (potato and green beans); there are a variety of vitamin supplements and the food definitely has a grilled sirloin steak odor. The beef is real along with grilled sirloin steak flavor.<br /><br />What is not particularly appealing is the poultry by-product meal (there is some nasty stuff in poulty by-products; four food dyes (they are labelled ""colors"") make the food look pretty but I would prefer the by-products and food dyes were eliminated. They seem to only serve a commercial purpose.<br /><br />Because of the semi-softness of the food, it can be served to all sizes of dogs (mine range from a chow chow to a bichon-poo). I would say if there is any problem with dogs not finding food offerings very appetizing, try  this food. In that department it's a winner.","My Dogs Say ""Yes!"" to the Flavor",4

When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!",A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!,4

"Switch Kiwi Berry Soda:<br /><br />First thing you notice is the light pink color of the soda. It is very lightly carbonated as there are almost no bubbles, yet it is carbonated. It has a pleasant aroma, light yet fruity.  Its taste is also light but sweet. Fruity with definite berry overtones.  There is though, a slight metallic aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but I notice it. The can has just over 8 ounces and may not be a large enough serving for those used to 12 ounce cans. I on the other  hand find myself often spilling out a few ounces of soda so there may be less waste overall, for me.  As in the other flavor I sampled (Watermelon Strawberry) Kiwi , Raspberry and Strawberry are mighty low in the list of juices in the soda. Still I find this flavor far more palatable than the other. I give it 4 stars and find it an acceptable fruit soda.",Pretty good berry soda,4

"As everyone has said, this cereal seems to be served primarily at mid-tier chains-- Hilton and Marriott branches. I've never seen it in stores, at least not in my area.<br /><br />Anyway, it's as good as any prepackaged cereal I've had, and better than some; sweet enough to satisfy those morning cravings, but not a sans-sustenance vehicle for sugar like so many others. You'll want to remember, however, that ""low-fat"" does NOT mean ""low-calorie"" -- a single 2/3 cup serving has 230 of them, higher than just about any boxed cereal I have in my cabinet. Still, it does its job of keeping you full most nicely; you won't be hungry later.<br /><br />Add to yogurt if you wish-- it keeps its nice crispy crunch and has a flavour far more sapid than pre-packaged yogurt/granola blends.<br /><br />Quick tip: if you've never ordered perishable goods on Ammy before, Super Saver is plenty fast enough for this item.

Would I go out of my way to get this product instead of Starbucks? No, I would not. In my area, this product is significantly more expensive than Starbuck's.

"This coconut water is superior to any other that includes sugar. Period. I've tried ""80% coconut water"", ""83%"" etc. but they're just too sweet to savor the fresh coconut taste.

It's slightly sour, as the real thing is.<br /><br />Problem is, if you don't use a straw - I prefer not to so I can easily re-seal the pack - the design of the pack leaves some water sloshing around at the end which is hard to get at without using a straw, cutting open the pack, or trying to bounce it out the opening. Which is really annoying, considering the thought of missing even a sip of this stuff.<br /><br />It's pricier than a lot of other options, but when you just have to have the sensation of drinking coconut water, you have few alternatives.

"Last month a friend brought me back a package of  dried mangoes from the Phillipines. I stared it for a week or so before opening it, not sure it would be to my taste.  But it was, and then some.  Yum.  Was delighted to discover I could get more of the same here on Amazon. (Well not exactly  the same, but both this brand and the one my friend brought back were from Cebu.) Makes a great between-meals nibble.  No bad fats. No cholesterol. Lots of Vitamin C. Also a first-rate take-along snack, as the pieces are dry and chewy but not sticky or staining or drippy at all. Nothing gets on your fingers.  Nothing noisy to annoy the moviegoers sitting next to you. No wrappers or residue that need throwing away.<br /><br />If anybody reading this knows another brand sold here on Amazon that has all the virtues mentioned above but is a little less sweet,  I'd be most grateful if you'd add a comment directing me to that brand.  Till then, this is my  ball-game, road-trip, woods-walk & between-meals  nibble of choice.  Highly recommended.","What a treat. Tastes great, no mess, no noise,  goes anywhere.",4

Have the rest of you coffee lovers nearly fainted over the sharply rising price of coffee? When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day. Just give it a try-some of you will not like it-but some of you will find it to be an excellent and reasonably priced supplement to those very expensive k-cups that we all love.,A Great Cup & Storage is not a problem,4

"These are made with mostly air and egg white and have a fantastic nutritional profile for bodybuilders and people losing weight or maintaining a weight loss.  I've lost 160 lbs through diet and exercise and like the reviewer who had surgery, I don't want to eat the amount of sugar found in normal meringues.  The fact there's a reasonable amount of protein in there is a bonus.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up I appreciate having a treat to bring to parties and dinners that I can both share AND eat, while staying within my daily nutritional target.  I like to bring them to church for coffee break after the service.<br /><br />I can find the chocolate ones in a grocery store 40 min from my home, but the vanilla ones nowhere.  This price beats the other online offers and you only have to buy 6 containers at a time.<br /><br />The chocolate meringues taste better by themselves than the vanilla meringues, although neither is to die for.<br /><br />Paired with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIZ9O"">TAZO Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion Tea, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, however, the vanilla meringues are fantastic.

"We all know by now that eating a balanced diet leads to a over all better quality of living.  Will this product be the end all fix for tricking your kids to get the proper amount of veggies a day.  No way, but that doesn't make it a bad product, just not a miracle in a pouch.  Each pouch is one combined serving of fruit and vegetable.  That  doesn't mean one serving of veggies and than one fruit but only one serving made up of both.  The taste isn't bad at all.  My kids inhale them as soon as I ration out their daily allowance.  I noticed the amount of sugar in these and only allow one a day.  My kids would love to drink these all day long if allowed.  They pass the kid taste test approval.  I subtracted the 5th star and only give a 4 because of the amount of sugar to volume, and that the juice is not 100% juice.  I would love to see a Super-V drink with 100% juice and not the 66% it currently has.  The Berry is the best tasting one in my opinion, but since we also buy apple, and fruit punch Super-V I notice they all go just as fast when offered to the kids.","No substitute for a healthy diet, but the kids love it",4

"Our daughter's school always has a gingerbread booth as part of their annual fundraiser and we wanted to offer a gluten free version for the kiddies, like our daughter, who can't have gluten.<br /><br />I figured this mix would be a great base to start with, as shortbread cookies are crunchy and often cut with a cookie cutter into a special shape. It did work great for gingerbread cookies with just a few modifications on our end.<br /><br />We followed the instructions exactly except that we used 1 whole egg, a 2nd yolk, and saved the extra egg white if the mix seemed too dry (it will indeed be dry as the instructions say, but if it's so dry that it flakes apart when trying to move it to the cookie sheet, absolutely add more egg white!) We then added an extra tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to alter the flavor to be more like gingerbreads. You can add powdered ginger if you want, however, our daughter prefers this milder ""spice"" recipe than when we add ginger, so we didn't use any.<br /><br />There was tons of positive feedback about the GF gingerbread cookies from both Gluten free folks and regular people - the recipe was a great success! We also thought they were incredibly tasty.<br /><br />Tip: ABSOLUTELY use the parchment paper when making these cookies! put it as a liner on the cookie sheet, also use it to roll out the dough on and also as a layer between the dough and the rolling pin. It made a huge difference! I've also heard that if you refrigerate the dough for an hour before rolling it out that it works better - we didn't try this though.<br /><br />So! whether you want to make G.F. shaped cookies for Halloween, the winter holidays, or whatever, this is a great mix to adapt!<br /><br />Happy Gluten Free Baking!",Used for G.F. gingerbread cookies - worked great!,4

"This might seem like an absurd idea, chocolate-flavored vinegar, and I can reassure you that the uses described on this product page -- especially marinating meats -- are guaranteed to nauseate your gourmet family and guests. But there is an interesting use for this and for the other Xtreme balsamics ... in home-made ice cream!<br /><br />Vinegar-flavored ice creams are currently a flourishing fad in parts of Europe, especially in Spain. The idea is to streak thin veins of vinegar through an otherwise too simpering a flavor. Balsamic works very well with strawberry, which is normally too sweet for my taste. This chocolate balsamic works in only very specific flavor contexts: with medium dark chocolate, with raspberry, with orange or blood orange (ice cream, not sorbet).

"I had been waiting for my regular coffee to become available again (Jet City Whole Bean Espresso), when I received one container as a gift and brewed it in my drip coffee maker just as it came out of the package.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee.  I had no real expectations that it would be any good.<br />It was better than most commercial Mainstream coffee, but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />Then I decided to run this ground coffee through my Capresso Conical Burr Grinder (with it set to the finest grind), and lo and behold this coffee was transformed into a pretty damn good cup of coffee. I purchased a pack of 6 and it is the best commercial coffee I have ever used.<br /><br />While I prefer my Whole Bean Jet City, this coffee is far more than just acceptable.<br /><br />So, if your regular coffee is not available, try this one and Grind it on Fine and give it a try.  It will hold you over until your favorite is available and the price was not bad at all.",Surprisingly good for mainstream coffee,4

"I ordered the 2 lbs, not knowing how many pieces will end up arriving.  In the end, I made 24 candy bags filled with about 8-9 pieces. There are much more small pieces (with two circles) than any other sizes. I got clear treat bags from art store and the colorful pieces looks reatlly great in the bags.  The colors were slightly different from the picture.  They were pink (or muted red), light blue, mint green and bright yellow, no whites or browns as shown in the picture.  As for the taste, the candies are hard, like the Sweathearts.  However, my son who has very picky taste for sweats loved the candy.  He usually won't even eat similar candies.

"If you are used to Hawaiian Punch, Snapple, sugary Kool-aid, or other ""fruity"" drinks, you won't find the same high fructose corn syrup kick in this product.  It actually tastes like real fruit juice...imagine that.<br /><br />I'll admit I like sweet fake-fruit drinks as much as the next person, so my first few sips of Izze's pomegranate sparkling water made me question my selection.  I had expected something more akin to lightly flavored water, but the taste was an overwhelming tartness.<br /><br />I have learned to enjoy though and wish my parents had given me this as a kid so that my tastebuds would consider this ""sweet"".  It is still a little strong and tart for me, so I mix it 1-to-1 with water.  Diluted by half is still enough flavor for me, so each 12 once can actually doubles in size when I drink it.<br /><br />Lastly, everything about the company suggests they will appeal to progressive-minded individuals, from their use of all natural products, their green endeavors (factories powered by wind) and their philanthropic operations.","Strong, less sweet taste",4

"I'm a casual coffee drinker who is more likely to like McDonalds or Duncan Donuts coffee than Starbucks, which I find too burnt. I also like sugar and milk so I'm not obsessing over subtleties of flavor. This coffee was noticably better than supermarket brands and, in my opinion, milder and superior to the fancy brands as well. It is a good quality coffee at a good price and, as a result, a good value. I'd recommend this and would consider this as an every-day brand.",Excellent coffee for the price,4

"Cheez-IT crackers are a great little snack - easy to eat, full of flavor and with a good shelf-life they are easy to keep on hand. Although I'd mostly stuck to the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONVON4"">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Original, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavor, a sale at Kroger's Grocery Store last year had me experimenting with some of the other flavors. Although the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYNTZ8"">Cheez It Baby Swiss Crackers, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN22"">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Duoz, Sharp Cheddar & Parmesan, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN9K"">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, White Cheddar, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavors were good, my particular favorites were the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZXFWP2"">Cheez-It Snack Mix, Baked Snack Assortment, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317ERWQ"">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Italian Four Cheese, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavors.<br /><br />Now Kellogg's has added a new Mozzarella Cheez-Its flavor, and I couldn't resist trying them. I have to say they aren't bad, but they aren't even close to being my favorite flavor. I think one of my favorite parts of the Cheez-Its experience is the bold flavor in their crackers, and the Mozzarella flavor is a bit too mild to suit me. Like I said, they aren't bad, but I wouldn't say they are great.<br /><br />Of course, something like flavor is a really subjective thing. Other people may prefer the mild flavor of the Mozzarella Cheez-Its to the bolder tastes in their other offerings.<br /><br />In all honesty, after discovering the Italian Four Cheese flavor, no other Cheez-It really comes close for me, with the exception of the Snack Mix, which is really completely different from just a Cheez-It.<br /><br />Do I recommend the Mozzarella Cheez-Its? I think they are an interesting flavor and are worth trying yourself. Everyone's tastes are different, and although I prefer the other flavors, you might very well consider the Mozzarella your own favorite.","Mozzarella flavor is interesting, but not my favorite Cheez-Its",4
"I like this. I have had more expensive truffle oils before, but I am perfectly happy with this. Just because it's not from france doesn't mean its not good! A good sparkeling wine (champange) from california, is still better than a bad one from champange france. The tase is waht I expected. Mine were packaged in shrink wrapped plastic and padding stuff, and arrived ok. Truffles, I understand, grow in many places in the world. I haven't tasted the finest quality (cannot find it, much less afford it), but this tastes similar to the other black truffle oils I have tasted (that were more expensive). I have no reservations recommending it, as long as you understand its not as subtile as white truffle, i.e its a bit stronger of a taste. It all what you like and can afford. Its great stuff!<br /><br />The other reviewer should have asked for a replacement, not a refund. You shouldn't derogate the product for something that is the fault of the shipping carrier, and possibly the packer.",good stuff,4

"I agree with all the other positive reviews here.  I too discovered this blend from a single pouch offered as part of a selection at a restaurant.  It has the flavor of black tea without the acidity.  The notes of fruit offer just a hint of sweetness, and does not dominant the flavor, which I like (I'm not a fan of fruity herbal teas). After brewing, I mix this dark, rich tea with warm milk to make a tea latte for morning tea.  I don't think I could make this a blend I drink every day but I do enjoy having it around for variety.",Very nice blend!,4

"I found this pasta in a local shop and the unique shape intrigued me; even when cooking for one, shouldn't dinner be a little special? The shape of the pasta can be very important to the flavors of a particular dish because of how it ""holds"" the sauce. I made this maccheroni al torchio with bolognese sauce and it turned out simply delicious.<br /><br />Remember to salt the water as you would with any pasta. These are pretty thick and cook up a little on the tender side; don't worry if you followed the directions and it seems *slightly* over boiled because after it sits in the colander for a few minutes it cools perfectly to al dente.<br /><br />The sauce clings really well to the pasta and the curls hold the meat from the sauce so every bite is balanced in flavor.<br /><br />I've added a photo so you can see the shape of the pasta a little better.<br /><br />Whether cooking for one or many, I think you'll enjoy this tasty, unusual shaped maccheroni.",molto bene!,4

"The Switch Kiwi Berry is a reasonable alternative for soda pop drinkers who want a more natural alternative and the juice drinkers who want something with a bit more fizz.<br /><br />The taste is somewhere between apple and strawberry though kiwi juice is in the ingredients (maybe I just don't know how kiwi juice tastes!).<br /><br />*** Positive Points Include: ***<br /><br />- Light Carbonation<br />- Made from 100% juice (blend of apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry, with a bit of vitamin c added.<br /><br />*** Negative Points Include: ***<br /><br />- A bit on the sweet side, then again most juices are<br />- Not a low sugar drink with about 33 grams of sugar<br />- Somewhat high price<br /><br />Overall this should be a good alternative drink for kids who cant seem to kick their soda pop habit.

Decided to buy one after using at my uncle's house. Absolutely love it except for the cup size. The larger mug option doesn't fill up a travel cup. I have to brew one cup of the larger and then one cup of the smaller for the travel cup to fill up. I use the same k cup and the coffee to water ratio is perfect for me. I also bought the reusable cups for the machine but find that they don't work very well and tend to waste coffee. It doesn't brew a strong enough cup. Maybe I have not perfected the grinds. I'll stick to my press for the weekend and k cups for the weekday. I love how quickly it brews and the temperature is perfect.  I do wish the resevoir was larger though. It is a pain in the butt having to refill constantly. You do have to run it a few times when first using as the other reviews say. There is a strong plastic smell that took about 5 brews to get rid of.,Fantastic,4

A couple of sniffs and then the treat disappeared.<br /><br />If I could change anything with the treats, I would love for them to come in a single bite instead of two biscuits together.

"Having just evaluated all of the CLEAR male hair products, it was time for the women in my house to evaluate the female hair products.  Both the male dandruff shampoo and the female ""strong lengths"" nourishing shampoo are advertised to feature Nutrium 10, some sort of vitamin nutrient compound that is supposed to make hair healthier and strong.<br /><br />I can't really speak much to if it makes hair stronger, but the shampoo certainly feels good going on and being lathered.  The shampoo itself appears about the same consistency of the male shampoo, a thin runny cream, but this one is pink.  The smell is quite nice without smelling like cheap perfume, and the smells tends to linger without being overpowering.<br /><br />The bottle itself is easy to use - snap down one end and the other end pops up to dispense shampoo.  Amazon had some issues shipping the free Vine samples - mine had leaked.  Hopefully they are more careful when shipping orders.<br /><br />After a few weeks of this shampoo, I'd say hair is clean and smells good, and the members of my family rate it highly.

"Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering.  Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature.  It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet.  Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you.  For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice.",Creamy & Delicious...but...,4
"This may not be the best truffle oil out there but for the price, it's very good, especially for an avid home cook. This oil is very aromatic and the flavor stands up well in soups and other foods. I use it a lot in soups. The best part for me is that this is affordable enough to try on all sorts of dishes I make at home. I've had truffle oil infused dishes at fine restaurants and I think the biggest difference, for my palate, is that the more expensive oils are slightly smoother in after taste. My husband can't tell the difference. But that is mostly due to the type of olive oil used from what I've been told, which makes sense since olive oil taste varies from brand to brand (and quality!). Nonetheless, I think the Urbani White Truffle Oil is a great way to add that extra dazzle to meals at home without sacrificing taste or money.",Very Good!,4

"When I bought this popcorn, it was because Amazon recommended it or at least showed it with the air popper. As other reviewers have said, this popcorn does not work in the air popper. It hasn't got enough weight  to stay in the popper long enough to pop. That same quality - lightness - is actually what makes it good popcorn otherwise. I recommend it for stove top popping in a deep saucepan with a lid.",Not for air poppers,4

"So I went to a local pet store in town that carries a LOT of dog food. When I stepped inside, I had no idea what I was looking for or what the difference was between hundreds of different dog foods. So a helpful employee gave me some tips. He explained to me that the 'low quality' dog foods, like science diet, purina, kibbles n bits, etc. contain a lot of fillers. That is, ingredients that provide no nutritional value to the dog. Translation = WAY more poop to pick up. Then there is the mid-grade dog food, like Nutrisource, that contains fewer fillers. That means the dog eats less, poops less, and is getting better nutrition from his food. I checked the labels of probably 15 different foods and this nutrisource brand looked like it had the best value. Yes, it's more expensive than your lower quality stuff, but the dog will also eat less of it. When my dog was on purina, he was eating about 3.5 cups a day. Since switching to nutrisource, he eats about 2.5 cups. So in the end, this better quality food is not a whole lot more expensive. I know it's unplesant to think about, but I should mention that since switching to nutrisouce, my dog farts a lot less and his poop stinks a lot less too, a very nice bonus for the responsible dog owner who needs to pick it all up.<br /><br />I would recommend this food for any large breed dog. My dog is 70 lbs, german sheppard/chow mix. The ""large bites"" food should be used for any dog over 35 lbs or so, as the chewing will also help keep their teeth clean!",Good dog food,4

"I liked this.  As far as meals in a box go, this had a pretty good flavor.  But calling it ""chicken and broccoli"" is a bit of a stretch.  The packet of broccoli was about the same size as the packet of seasoning.  I think there might have been as much salt as there was broccoli.  This pasta also looks like rice.  It doesn't taste like rice because it's much softer so there's a bit of a disconnect between your eyes and your taste buds when you eat it.  In the end though, this isn't a bad option, just make sure you have a vegetable on the side.",Not for broccoli lovers,4

">I received one packet from the Amazon Vine program to test and review.  I tried this one afternoon when it was rather cold and damp outside.  I was feeling a bit under the weather myself.<br />>I added half a packet to hot water and it dissolved very easily.  The tea smells like ginger with a whiff of lemon.  The flavor is predominantly ginger, very light lemon flavor.  I didn't taste honey or any other sweet flavor, just the ginger.  It has a strong lingering in the mouth flavor, so strong in fact I was very, very happy that I had only only added half the packet.<br />>Within a few minutes of that first sip, I started feeling a bit better.  This unquestionably helped settle my stomach and relive some of my congestion.<br />>I had planned to try the other half packet as a cold drink, but the hot tea was so soothing, that I fixed it up the next afternoon instead.<br />This is not an everyday, thirst quenching drink to me, but rather a home remedy for cold & flu symptoms.",Relives a Stuffy Nose and Upset Stomach,4

After an initial try I ordered the 6 pack of my 3 favorite flavors.  I've been really happy with my breakfast every morning of oatmeal and tea.  My only issues are the small amount of soy used and freshness.  I'd prefer they used something else or at least be sure the soy is organic.

"I am not a diehard tea drinker and am a diet coke junkie.  That said - I liked the idea of trying the health benefits of green tea and, lately, have found a hot cup of tea a great way to start/end the day.<br /><br />This tea is fruity and not bitter.  I add a packet of sweetner in the AM and it is perfect.  I highly recommend this one!!","Flavorful, fruity green tea",4
"The bottom line is that I recommend these treats.<br /><br />We've been feeding our dogs organic food and treats for years. Our pooches were just as happy to eat Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog Treats as they do their regular organic treats. Taste wise, they seem to rate 5 stars.<br /><br />Take note that these treats are hard. If your pooch is a gulper, you might need to break it into pieces. Our dogs are all chewers and took their time right down to licking the floor to get the crumbs.<br /><br />Price wise, these treats cost slightly more than the organic brands I usually buy. It appears Amazon will eventually provide these through the ""Subscribe and Save"" program. If / when that happens, the 15% discount will bring these down in price. Until then, I'm knocking off one star for price.<br /><br />If you question whether, in general, it's worth paying a premium price for organic foods and treats, read on.<br /><br />Treat prices and ingredient quality vary wildly. Higher quality almost always equals higher price. Products certified ""organic"" usually add yet another premium.<br /><br />Whether or not you buy organic pretty much depends on whether or not you've given thought to what your dog is eating. In our case, we admitedly gave it little thought. At the super market we always bought name brand foods and treats and figured that doing so made us good gaurdians.<br /><br />Oliver, our 8 year old dachsund, suffered loose stools and had trouble keeping down food for years. After a really bad case of him having the runs, it was recommended that we try changing his diet to certified organic products containing no wheat or corn.<br /><br />We learned that grains used in most super market dog food and treats are often a mixture of wheat and corn said to cause allergies that can cause stomach problems.<br /><br />Additionally, products not certified organic are allowed to be inconsistent. Between batches, the amount of meat by-products can vary wildly.  By-products include lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, blood, bone, and stomach and intestines.<br /><br />Also, non-organic pet food can be leagally made from meat sources rejected for human consumption. Shockingly, even brand name pet food manufacturors are often a legal dumping ground for dead, dying, disabled and deseased animals.<br /><br />Making the change to all organic food and treats made a difference with Olliver in just a few days. It's been years now since I've had to clean up one of his messes.<br /><br />Olliver's canine housemates had no qualms eating the lower grade food. While they don't seem to care we made the choice to feed them better, we sure feel better knowing what it is they're really eating.",Our Little Gourmands Rated These Five Paws!,4

"I was wandering the aisles of my local Wegmans supermarket recently and saw Brad's Raw Leafy Kale--Naked flavor on the shelf. We use fresh kale all the time for our smoothies, but I haven't been able to get myself to eat ""raw"" kale, like just-picked-from-the-garden-that-we-use-for-our-smoothies kale. So when I saw this ""raw"" kale snack I thought, they're not really ""raw."" They are dehydrated (under 115&#730;F) and seasoned, to make them palatable. And they are DELICIOUS. I love them. I am hooked. They have a slight crunch, but not a chip crunch, more like a firm bite. My kids like the initial taste but don't like the aftertaste. I love the whole thing. The problem is that they only come in a 2.5 ounce clear plastic container (supposedly 2.5 servings), which I can easily eat in one sitting. "" If you look at the nutrition facts, you'll notice they're not totally healthy. They have 9 g of fat per serving, or 22.5 g of fat per container, which realistically is what I could eat at a time if I were hungry. They are also a bit pricey (I paid $7.50 for the one package). Surprisingly, Amazon's price is higher, so I'll have to buy them directly from Brad's website, or from Wegmans or Whole Foods. If these were cheaper, I'd buy them all the time. But for now they're more like a ""treat myself"" kind of snack.","Great snack, but pricey",4

"This is a pretty decent bar to snack on.  It has a sort of brownie-like consistency and taste.  The primary ingredient in this bar is dates which seems to be a pretty common one in the natural/vegan realm of sweats.  In turn, it has a pretty distinctive taste.  It is pretty tasty with a cocoa (not a rich chocolate) and almond flavor.  Quite moist which is nice.  My only complaint is that each bar is pretty small at 1.7 oz.  While golfing, I often eat bars like Odwalla or Cliff that are 2+ oz.<br /><br />On a sort of side note, it would be nice if Amazon posted the Nutritional Facts and Ingredients for all the food products they sell.",Tasty Brownie-Like Bar,4
"These tasty almonds are very (VERY) lightly-covered with dark cocoa powder, but if I hadn't read the label, I wouldn't have noticed.

(I think they would taste better without the coating.)<br /><br />There are 11 servings in a jar, each with 150 calories, and the lid measures one serving perfectly.

And I always set my Keurig to the smallest cup-size setting and feel this is the right level for maximizing the flavor of each k-cup - haven't tested how these taste with larger cups.

"The flavor is almost entirely ginger.  It is barely sweetened and not at all lemony.  I really liked it but I don't think the rest of my family would.  The others would have put a couple of spoons of sugar and a big squeeze of lemon in it. (they like ginger-flavored hot lemonade.)<br />The flavor is much the same as slicing a couple of quarter sized slices of ginger into a cup, adding hot water, and mashing it a bit.  Then add one of those tiny scoops of stevia, or a few drops of stevia extract.<br />This product is a nice alternative for when you don't room in your pocket for ginger root and a knife. Honestly I will probably buy some for sick days.  I lived in Cambodia and the grocery shelves were always stocked with at least 6 brands of ginger drink so I do have an appropriate background to judge.  This product is at least equal to the best of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not a very satisfactory trial. We were sent only one packet from the box, so there was no listing of ingredients or nutritional information.  So I can't say how many carbs and how much sugar is included.  Yes, honey is nice but honey is made of sugar, sugar, and sugar.  Many of us really need to know how much.<br /><br /> I also have to vent, and this is probably not the company that produced it, but an Amazon employee - the single packet, the size of a tea bag, was sent in a 12x18x6 inch cardboard box with six yards of bubble wrap.

I've never been disappointed with the Cafe Excellence brand of coffee.  The Serendipity blend has that good coffee aroma with a taste to match.  I've given it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 because it doesn't live up to the other blends of Cafe Excellence that I have tried.  It is still better than most other coffees.,I like this brand of coffee,4

"Annie Chun's Vietnamese Pho Soup Bowl is filling and delicious. A mild scallion flavored broth in soft noodles describes it best adding it has a very fresh taste. I, like another reviewer, prefer to take it up a notch with spice, and thought possibly I'd  be able to taste ginger or other mentioned spices in Annie's description of the soup bowl, but I could not. Nonetheless I would recommend and purchase it again, it was certainly tasty and even similar to restaurant Pho Soup I have eaten from a Vietnamese Restaurant. Added bonuses are the soup comes with an eco-friendly bowl and Annie uses all natural and organic ingredients.","Yummy, delicious soup bowl and lowfat, too",4

"My 1 year old Boxer mix absolutely loves this toy ~ He was trying to play with it before I could even get it out of the packaging! It seems to be durable and is holding up well so far, my only concern is replacing the rope after my dog wears it out (he destroys rope toys in about 2 weeks usually). Other than that, I would recommend this to other dog owners whose dogs like to chew and play tug-of-war. Just make sure you don't mind little pieces of treats all over your floor - it's surprising how much treat actually dispenses, and my dog tends to overlook some of the dispensed treats when he is feeling playful. I wouldn't recommend this for small dogs, just because it is a good sized toy, but for medium to large dogs, this is great!",Great!,4

"(Update on May 22, 2012) I used to absolutely love this granola bar! One problem, in the last 2 batches of subcription I received, I've noticed they changed the recipe! Bad mistake, General Mills! The current variation is now more sticky and tougher to chew. The taste is not as balanced as before either, and the nutritional value is different.<br /><br />Calories are the same, but the Total Fat is increased. Saturated Fat is decreased, but the Sodium increased, carbs is increased. Fiber is DECREASED with Sugars INCREASED! What this means for me is what used to be a 4 Weight Watchers Points Plus breakfast, is now 5 points. Sure it's only 1 points, but the taste isn't as good any more.<br />In the ingredients list one notable difference is that there is now less dark chocolate chunks, but more sugar.<br /><br />All in all, I wish they would go back to the old recipe. It's still good, but not as great as before.<br /><br />---- Earlier review: (5/9/11) ----<br />This is a chewy delicious granola bar that is pretty sweet but not overly so because it has dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate.<br />The almonds give it a nice crunch, and there is a peanut-butter-like layer on the bottom, and I dont even like peanut butter that much and I love it.<br /><br />I'm on the Weight Watcher Points Plus and I was looking for a nice filling granola bar that I can either eat as a breakfast bar, or as dessert, and it fits both perfectly, and at 4 points per bar, I still have enough points to eat a good portion lunch or dinner.<br /><br />I highly recommend it so much that I'm going to get an amazon subscription for it!",I used to absolutely love this!-EDIT,4

"When it comes to dog food, as you can see with the many reviews on Purina Chef Michael's products, you have passionate pet owners who are concerned about their dogs health and feeding them the best food possible.<br /><br />I admire pet owners who can do just that, as I know many who prefer to cook their dogs meal to those who will splurge in order to make sure their dogs eat the best and are healthy.  But with today's economy, I also know that there are owners who can't cook, can't splurge and try to look for the best price that they can to feed their dog(s).<br /><br />Purina's Chef Michels brand sounds like gourmet food for the dogs.  But looking at the price, how can gourmet food be so cheap?  Well, for the Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor dog food which comes with potato & green bean garnishes, there is no doubt that many dogs will eat it.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate and many more.<br /><br />My small adult Pug-tzu's love eating this dry dog food.  It's small and at first they sniffed it but after 10 minutes or so, they began scarfing it down.  I did mix it with other dog food but on its own, I'm sure they enjoy it.  And what I like about it is that Amazon offers it for under $10, Purina does say they use real beef and the crunchy kibbles includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Granted, after eating this, they also tend to have more stools.  I also want to note that my dogs did not produce any horrid flatulence after eating this dog food, like others have reported.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm not an erudite when it comes to what is healthy for dogs and what isn't.  There are many reviews from hardcore dog lovers that you can read on this product to know that many have chimed in and called this ""junk food"" for their dogs.<br /><br />But I also feel that there are many people out there who are dog owners who can't afford to pay so much for their dog's food and the price of this dry dog food is quite appealing.  Purina does claim this particular Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dry dog food does include 23 essential vitamins and nutrients.<br /><br />So, for the pet owners who are very budget-conscious, are looking for dry dog food that their small dogs will enjoy but also getting the essential vitamins in their meal, then Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food may be for you.","You're dogs will love it, owners will love it for the price but it may not be the healthiest...",4

"I'm always a little challenged to review something my dogs eat, but in this case, my dogs have enthusiastically communicated that they enjoyed this product.  So as far as taste goes, this is a winner.<br /><br />But what about nutrition?  Most of the leading ingredients are proteins, which puts this in a different category of quality from the more corn based dog foods (this still does have corn and rice, but they seem to be about a fifth of the content).  Much of the protein is from soy instead of animals.  It's also been dyed, which doesn't seem necessary to me.  It looks pleasing to people, but there's not much reason to give a dog colored food.  But in my opinion, a dog can be healthy eating this as long as it's part of a balanced diet.<br /><br />I would add veggies and actual meat from my own dinners to my dog's diet.  I tend to give them both at least a serving every day, but then they eat some kind of normal dog food for the majority of their diet.  This approach has led to my dogs being healthy and living long lives.<br /><br />There are more expensive and healthier dog foods, but Chef Michael's dog food is a healthier and apparently tastier alternative to the other grocery store brands.",Pretty good,4

"I have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have thick, wavy black hair (which has been dyed brown in the past), and I thought this was an okay product to use. Even though it's not perfect, I would say my hair is better when I use this product than when I don't use this product.If your hair is naturally oily and rarely gets dry, you're fortunate enough not to need oils like these. But if your hair gets dry and perhaps frizzy once you're out of the shower, you should try this hair oil.<br /><br />I use this product 2 or 3 times a week. I massage it into my hair at least half an hour before I take a shower. It smells a little, and it's really up to you whether you find it a good or bad smell, but I personally don't like it. When I'm in the shower, I use small amounts of shampoo and conditioner (which is what you're supposed to do anyway) and wash out my hair with cold water. Then I let my hair air-dry or towel-dry and apply a leave-in conditioner of a different brand. And my hair feels good afterward! It's not dry nor oily, it doesn't look frizzy, and people have told me my hair is looking healthier over time.<br /><br />I basically don't like the smell of this product. And I'm sure there are much better, albeit more expensive, hair oil brands out there. But if you need to cure your hair of dryness, you should make your shower routine more like mine.",Use before showering on dry/frizzy hair,4

I don't agree with the previous reviewer that it smells like dog food but the smell is not so pleasant but it's cured meat most don't smell too great and what can you expect from meat that has been aging in a cellar. I enjoy these little Salami chubs as a little snack to tide me over til Dinner or whatever. Flavor wise it can be a bit salty. My main gripe about this Salami Chub is the oily-ness that's on the outside. I usually dab or wipe the chub with a napkin before eating to remove some of the oily-ness. Overall it's a great snack to have on the go. It's perfect for a romantic picnic @ the park.

I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Busy Bone Chewbone treat. He has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm. It takes him about 15-20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down. I just make sure he keeps it off white stuff. The red  center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface.  My dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on. I have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that I have to. I also wish they were cheaper.,dog gives 5 star for taest I give 3.5 for mess,4

"When the box says pasta and broccoli you expect broccoli. Most expect a pasta not a Orzo, a rice shaped minute pasta. This meal wasn't exactly what the box advertized. But this review is not on the box alone but on the food in the box.<br /><br />  Easy to make? yes. Not difficult at all. Healthy? not really, the amount of sodium, fat and lack of fresh or frozen veggies make it not very healthy. That brings me to the lack of broccoli. Dried flakes of broccoli does not have the same health value or nutritional value as fresh or even frozen broccoli. This meal had broccoli flavoring rather than broccoli. A small amount of flakes that left a slight flavor but was a disappointment for anyone who likes broccoli or wants to include it in a flavor friendly way for children (or adults)<br /><br /> The saving grace of the meal? It tasted good. Really good. It was a type of American risotto. My husband who usually hates risotto loved it. I loved it. Kids loved it after they got over the shape.<br /><br />  It is rated 4 stars because of the flavor and texture of the food. Because it was requested again and because it is easy to store and whip up anytime. While it is higher in salt than I would like it is less salty than Velveeta's other box pastas. Cons don't expect broccoli or it to be the standard mac and cheese it's not. But it is good. Had it been what was advertised or had lost of broccoli it might of received 5 stars.",Not your standard Mac and Cheese but Good! Where is the Broccoli?,4

"Currently, we feed our older Collie the Kirkland brand dog food for senior dogs.  We chose that food after doing online research and the fact that it included glucosamine.  We found out that a lot of dog foods don't so you would have to add a supplement if your dog needed it.<br /><br />We still feed her that food, but now sprinkle a small hand full of this product on top and she gobbles everything in sight and basically licks the bowl clean.<br /><br />I can definitely say that the bag comes pack with the sirloin as in even our little hand fulls, our Collie is getting quite a lot of them.",Good addition to my dog's already solid food.,4

"Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.",Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.,4

"We love cherry pie made with tart cherries, we find the pre-made cherry pie fillings a bit too sweet, so I was so happy to find the Oregon Fruit Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Water at Amazon as the price was competitive, or better, than at my local grocery store.<br /><br />The cherries themselves were tasty and made perfect pie. Be aware there is a warning on the label concerning cherry pits.<br /><br />Also, the cans of cherries arrived pretty dinged up. The strange thing is how the packaging was surrounding the cans looked fine, but the cans were dented.

"I love granola, so I knew I would like Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola.  I just didn't know how much I would love it!  They definitely didn't skimp on the chocolate when they made this.  There are chocolate chunks in every bite.  And the taste of the chocolate!  Oh my goodness, this is creamy chocolate.  It wasn't bitter at all, the way some dark chocolates can be.  They did skimp on the berries, which is why I marked it down a star.  I would have liked it even better if they had doubled the amount of berries, but what they did put in there is quality.  When this granola is in milk, the berries almost taste fresh.<br /><br />I even like these as a snack.  Straight from the bag or mixed with yougurt, I love it!  I also like that this granola organic.  Heck, it tastes so good, I would keep it in the house, even if it weren't so good for me.  But I really like that I don't have to feel guilty while I indulge in this delicious treat!  I only wish these were available through Subscribe & Save.",I have a new favorite granola!,4

"I am a ramen lover and have tried hundreds of varieties over the years, including my time in Japan, the land of endless ramen varieties. Nong Shim (Korean) is a long-time favorite and among the top 3 makers on my list. Their noodles are heartier and more delicious than everybody else's, mostly because they use better ingredients. The texture is firmer and more elastic, even retaining their chewy mouth-feel over time, unlike other noodles that quickly become mushy. If you're used to bargain basement brands like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061I6UE"">NISSIN TOP RAMEN</a>, do yourself a favor and try a Nong Shim.<br /><br />Among the higher quality ingredients that Nong Shim puts in here are ginger and shrimp extracts, beef and pork bone stock, and beef tallow. Beef tallow is the same stuff that makes McDonald's french fries so tasty.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ very tasty, spicy, and filling<br />+ excellent texture to vegetable seasoning pack (dried cabbage, carrots, onions, mushroom). I can actually taste the veggie bits.<br />+ 0mg cholesterol and no trans-fats<br /><br />Cons<br />- 500 calories in 1 pack. 160 of which are fat calories<br />- 40% of your daily saturated fat intake<br />- EXTREMELY SALTY: 94% of your daily sodium intake if you drink the soup<br /><br />Despite directions for boiling the noodles for 3 minutes, it can be prepared with just boiling water and a bowl. I made some with hot water from the office Flavia machine (coffee and tea maker) and waited 5 minutes.<br /><br />Because of the very high sodium and fat content, instant ramen should not be eaten often. But in a pinch (either due to lack of time, money, cooking skills, or all 3), ramen can provide a quick and filling meal. It is very easy to add vegetables and leftovers to it to mitigate the saltiness and provide better nutritional value. Ramen alone is just calories, fat, and salt and offers little nutrition. The powder packet packs a punch, and half a pack or less is sufficient for full flavor and to reduce the sodium level.<br /><br />Canned corn can be added (a popular topping in Japan), soft boiled egg, shredded green or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I02JBY"">Chinese/Nappa cabbage</a> or other vegetables, kimchi, spring onions, boiled shrimp or fish fillet, or whatever you like. The soup packet can also be used to make a pot of spicy soup, as you would use a soup mix or bouillon cube.<br /><br />Instant ramen is unhealthy, because they are fried in palm oil or some other fat, then dried and packaged. But if you're going to eat something bad for you, might as well have it be delicious, and this Nong Shim variety is among the best.<br /><br />Product made in CA.","Very delicious, but very high in sodium",4
"I normally like white teas, and this is no exception. It's very fruity, and I especially enjoy it served hot. I found this one required longer steeping than the directions stated, and it's also a bit weak, so you'll want to use no more than six ounces of water per bag.<br /><br />Nantucket Nectars used to make a very delicious blueberry tea, which they've since discontinued, so I was excited to try another blueberry tea. This unfortunately is not nearly as good as Nantucket Nectars Blueberry Tea and just didn't taste right served cold, in my opinion, but as a hot tea, I do recommend this one.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that I don't understand why Lipton is using plastic tea bags now. Isn't plastic bad for the earth? Doesn't it take hundreds of years to biodegrade? I've read reports that plastic bottles are a health hazard. I don't know if this is the same kind of plastic, but it just doesn't feel right making hot tea with a plastic tea bag, so I just cut the plastic bag open and use it with my tea infuser.","Mild, fruity flavor 3.5 stars",4

"I am so in love with Albanese Gummi Bears.  The consistency is not too soft and not too hard.  So, I decided to try the Albanese Gummi Rings in Peach for a change.  The consistency is quite gummi and not like a fruit slice, but the flavor just was not what I expected.  They are a tad bit softer than a gummi bear.  I expected a fresh taste like a juicy peach right off the tree.  There is definitely a peach taste, but not a fresh real peach taste.  It is not horrible and I enjoyed them to some extent.  Two gummies at a time were enough, any more and it was too much.  I suppose calorie wise, that is a good thing.<br /><br />I'm going to give these four stars as I do like them, but probably would not buy them again.  I can see other people enjoying these more than me.  I think really that it is a consistency thing.  To compare this to other types of gummi rings, I would say these are definitely better.  If you are a gummi ring lover, I would say that you would enjoy this candy.  The price is phenomenal.  You get two bags of 4.5 pounds each for a total of nine pounds!  That's a lot of candy.  I always have candy out in pretty clear containers at my home so that my friends will feel comfortable taking what they want.  My guests really enjoyed these rings and my stash went very quickly.<br /><br />The gummy rings were shipped in perfect condition and there was no melting and I am in Florida.  They were a bit warm, but they quickly come to room temperature and are perfect.<br /><br />These would be cute for wedding treats and a candy bar too.

"whenever Amazon sells Jerky under $1 per ounce, I always like to sample it.  I recall seeing this brand at my local Target over $1.50 per ounce (BTW - Target's $1/oz house brand Pepper Jerky is great).  I tried Wild Ride's Peppered and Hickory, since sweeter flavored Jerky are rarely done right.  Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint - very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.  I'd call the Pepper a 3 star jerky, and the Hickory 2 star jerky, that both earn a bonus star as long as it's available under $1/oz.

"I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this!

"I'm more of a milk chocolate kind of person, so I didn't expect to like this, but it's actually very smooth and not bitter.<br />Since dark chocolate is so good for you, and milk chocolate, well, isn't, I was hoping I'd find a dark chocolate bar that didn't have a nasty bitter aftertaste. This meets that criteria!<br />The bars are small, but it's rich and satisfying, and all you really need, even for PMS. I can feel the grumpiness melt away, replaced by mild euphoria and a feeling of peace, contentment, and love for everyone. Chocolate is a miracle drug, and this particular one is high quality, good stuff.<br />DH knows that there are certain times he will need to throw one of these in ahead of him and run past and wait for the chocolate to kick in. He considers these a good investment, and I like the taste, texture and health benefits.<br />I feel much less guilty eating these than I would milk chocolate, or my beloved forbidden white chocolate.<br />I'm very satisfied with this product.","Delicious, not bitter. Also good for PMS!",4
a good entry level sewing machine for home use. i used it couple of times and its fit to pupose with no frills. bobins are of plastic unlike the steel ones. slider up/down lever is also of plastic. making it delicate to handle.

"These packets are really great, but they function best if you add vegetables and rice -- they're not so good just by themselves.  By themselves, they are too salty and spicy.  If you add vegetables and rice, each packet makes much more of a meal, and the flavor is just right.",Great but spicy!,4

"First, I had to get over my bias against instant coffee.  Going in, I told myself that there are positives about instant coffee: (1) the packets are easy to carry & easy to mix (time saver), (2) the flavor has improved over the years, and (3) there are more varieties today (even Starbucks packages instant coffee).<br /><br />What I was looking for in the Nescafe Memento Cappuccino was (1) a not so calorie laden coffee and (2) an afternoon or after dinner dessert coffee.<br /><br />The Memento Cappuccino is not a coffeehouse cappuccino because it isn't as strong as the cappuccino that I purchase at my coffeehouse.  However, it isn't bitter, so I do give it points for that since I can remember the days when instant coffee was very bitter.  I followed the instructions & mixed the packets contents with 8oz of hot water in a 10oz cup. The ratio of milk to coffee was good & the mixed drink tasted like a cappuccino.  The mix produced a slight foam that sat on top of the coffee for quite a while.  The mix contains sugar, so I did not need to add more sugar (but those who like a sweeter coffee will want to add more sugar).<br /><br />Verdict:  Nescafe Memento is a decent, convenient coffee packet to have on hand for those times when you want a cappuccino but don't want to brew one or go to your coffeehouse to purchase one.  With the individual packets, it is also easy to throw a few packets into your suitcase or backpack.","Convenient. Not Strong, but Creamy & Smooth (for an Instant Coffee)",4

"No, these are not crunchy, as the name implies... but are fresh strawberries ""crunchy""?  If you put them in a bowl, add milk or rice milk to soften a bit, then add your cereal, nuts, whatever, you make a really great breakfast with a fruit flavor, no matter what the season. This particular brand is the only organic one where the berries are grown & processed in the U.S. I get them on Amazon's auto-ship plan, which brings the price down quite a bit, making it far lower than getting an equivalent in a market - which frankly, you can't, because even organic stores don't usually list where their freeze-dried berries are grown.","not crunchy, but good",4

"Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old ""when it rains it pours"" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.",SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style,4

It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: ""Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties.""

"The back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola was better tasting than I had expected. The dark chocolate is delicious and the granola is good tasting too. It is a bit difficult to eat out of the bag because it is broken up fairly small. This is a good thing for younger kids, but as an adult I would like bigger clumps. It is a bit on the dry side, but what granola product isn't. There seems to be a nice mix of the granola to chocolate. I found a couple of large clumps of chocolate and claimed them as mine before anybody else in the house could get them. ;) It makes a nice, quick, snack. It would be nice to take on the go, but I wouldn't take it along if it was too warm because the chocolate would probably melt and make a mess. My 10 year old came along and grabbed a handful and a few minutes later came back and asked if they could have some more, so this passes the kid test with me.",Mmmmmm Chocolate,4

"I've been looking for a decent instant coffee, and since I like Greek coffee, decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it's not bad stuff -- but since I don't read Greek, it's taken a lot of experimentation with amounts to get the amounts right.  I find that if I don't use enough of the instant granules, I get a thin acidic cup, so I personally use about two tablespoons per cup of hot water.<br /><br />Remember that this is intended to taste like strong Greek coffee, not drip-brew, and is best taken with sugar, no cream.  I normally take my coffee black, but this doesn't taste quite right to me without a little sugar.","Good stuff, needs experimentation",4

"Strong espresso taste with a hint of mil, but a tiny bit bitter for me, yet not as much as the cappuccino flavor. If you like a little bitterness, then you'll prolly love this. Thankfully no can taste, which was a concern of mine. I prefer a bit more milk in mine (soy or rice).<br /><br />Otherwise not much to say - plain, no flavors, although I'm sure you could add your own if you want i, but taste fine just like it is.<br /><br />The bitterness was just a hint, which many regular espresso drinkers probably wouldn't notice - for me, it was enough to take off a star, but was still good.

"We have a 16 week Cocker Spaniel-Australian Shepherd mix (~20 lbs). We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, ""Okay, now what?  What's next??""<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.<br /><br />Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds.","Good fun, but too easy",4
"My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however.",Not bad but a little hard to get used to,4
"""Back to Nature"" Chocolate Delight Granola was certainly a pleasant surprise.  I have always been a fan of granola bars, oatmeal, and, of course, chocolate, but I never expected to enjoy this food quite as much as I did.  The taste is not merely the blandness of oats or the sugary sweetness of the chocolate but a wonderful combination of the two, neither of which comes across as overpowering but as a subtle, healthy snack for one to eat.  If you are interested in this product, you might also be most interested to note the excessive fiber content, which is another of granola's additional benefits.<br /><br />Any complaint I have regarding the product is purely logistical.  Let's be honest: eating loose, bulk granola isn't easy.  I dropped as much on my floor as I put in my mouth.  I suppose the most effective method of eating the granola would be to put it in a bowl and spoon it like cereal, but that eliminates the ability for the product to be carried around for a snack, taken camping, etc.  While one cannot as easily control the portion size of granola bars, they remain a much easier and more effective method of consumption than loose granola.","Delicious, but Difficult to Eat!",4

"I didn't expect too much from this dinner-in-a-box meal and it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />I cooked the dish using ground turkey and once browned, added the water, elbow pasta, and powdered seasoning pack as instructed. Once that got thoroughly mixed and simmered for a while I added the Velveeta creamy cheese sauce, stirred, and the dinner entree was done.<br /><br />The result was something like a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese but with larger pasta, meat, and a creamier texture.  The Velveeta flavor was not as chemically cheesy/sharp as Kraft and the subtle differences in the seasoning made it more interesting than the one-note Kraft.<br /><br />If I was to do this again I would add kielbasa or sausage to add more interest.<br /><br />Overall, not bad for an ""instant"" dinner.",Not Bad for What It Is,4

Put in microwave for 1 minute and 15 seconds.  That's it.  I have been adding nuts to mine before cooking and that works great.  What results is basic chocolate cake with a mild caramel sauce squiggled on it.  The warmth factor is what makes this so appealing; it really seems to add a nice and satisfying quality to it.  Also, while it's definitely sweet, it isn't as sweet as I was worried it would be.  You could choose to use less of the caramel sauce if you wanted, of course, or add other ingredients like I do; I'm going to try coconut and berries, but just a few nuts is really great.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy this again simply because I feel like the packaging is overkill and I do want to try replicating this process with a plain box of cake mix.

You need to leave the tea bad in a hot cup of water for a couple minutes to make sure you get a high concentration of the tea. After that stir in some honey and you are set.<br /><br />Very happy.,Fantastic tea.,4

"Received 2 boxes of Reg Timothy's and 2 boxes of Decaff. Packaging was excellent and delivered in just a few days.

"I'm normally not a fan of dark chocolate, but this granola is really understated and not the least bit bitter.  It's also not the type of granola that's so sharp and hard that it could sandpaper a wall!  It's crunchy, yet breaks apart easily while chewing and is really satisfying and delicious.  I'm not sure about buying 6 packs at a time, as packaged here on Amazon.  But I really liked it and would probably pick up a bag here and there at my local grocery store.  Definitely interested in the other flavors too.  Wish Amazon offered a variety pack instead; 2 bags of each of the 3 flavors.  Now that's something I would buy for sure.  We love it in our morning oatmeal -- YUM! :oD",Really Good in Oatmeal!,4
"While attempting to avoid aspartame flavored drinks I found the Lipton Tea with Honey in the Blackberry Pomegrante flavor.  It tastes good, although it can be a bit too sweet.  Instead of adding one package to 8 ounces of water I add it to 16 which makes it better.  The first ingredient is Honey Granules which is a combination of honey and sugar, and several ingredients later is Sucralose.  While I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners all together I do not mind Sucralose (generic for Splenda) as much as I dislike aspartame.<br /><br />It also has 60 mg of flavanoids per serving.  All in all I would recommend this product.",Pretty good,4

"In my search to find the perfect food for my two mini-dachshunds I discovered the world of ""breed specific"" dog food, which intrigued me because of the unique health concerns for the breed.  The two I found for dachshunds were Eukanuba and Royal Canin.  Both received moderate ratings on other websites [...]).  I opted to try Eukanuba because of the price - granted it is still pricey but cheaper than Royal Canin.  Both dogs eat it without a fuss and have had no apparent digestive issues with this food.  I would recommend it.  The only drawback is the price of the product.",Pricey but Recommend It,4
"I fixed this dish with lean ground beef.  Browned the meat, added two cups of water, stirred in the seasoning and macaroni.  When that was done few minutes later, I added the Velveeta Cheese, minus a few tablespoons, and VIOLA!!  It was tasty for a quick dish.<br /><br />Don't overcook the macaroni, use the exact minutes stated on the box.  The Velveeta Cheese is tasty.  And, you can't expect this to be lacking calories, as anything with cheese can be a killer!  But I like it.<br /><br />Upon reheating, I used the remaining cheese.  It works great.<br /><br />With a lb of ground beef, you have plenty of macaroni, seasonings, and cheese.  This will serve a small family, providing you have a vegetable side dish too.<br /><br />But, here's the key.  Eat at while fresh, because when you reheat, the macaroni can get mushy.  Or, make sure you do not overcook the macaroni the first round.<br /><br />Kraft Velveeta..... tasty, easy to make, great for kids too. ...Rizzo","It's no Julia Child.....but it's very tasty, easy to fix!",4

"I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.  He has food allergies so having this medication in the form of duck breast (something which dogs are rarely allergic to I am told) was perfect for our Buddy.  He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.

"Of all the Earl Grey's I've tried, this and Tazo's version are the most robust. If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Tazo are your Earl Greys of choice. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.",Robust Earl Grey,4

"Im not a coffee connoisseur at all and cant tell the difference between harbucks or mcdowels, but I do know the taste of ca phe sua da in socal and have been casually engaged in finding the right blend.  The oft recommended, Cafe du Monde, is definitely not the flavor.  Im not sure what chicory is, but its a funny tasting coffee, fairly mild, and no matter how long I try to filter it to get it stronger/darker, the coffee just isnt the right amount of blackness.  So I turned to Trung Nguyen, and based on recommendations from internet, friends, and the website itself, this is one of (if not the) most popular blend.  Its got a great flavor full of nuttiness and sure presses better than du Monde (almost no grounds at bottom of cup), but its still not the ca phe sua da Im used to.  For one, the color is a definite brown, not black and it isnt strong.  Ill give the Creative #1 a try which says its a dark and strong robusta coffee (no blend), compared to this which is a blend of nearly everything.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great tasting coffee full of complex flavors that are beyond what I can describe, give this a try... you wont be disappointed to the least.  But, if you are looking for that really strong, jet black coffee that can strip paint off a car and wake up dirt, and that when mixed with condensed milk turns into a rich golden-brown concoction that is ca phe sua da, then you need to look elsewhere (like that Creative #1... possibly).","great coffee, but not the flavor Im looking for for ca phe sua da",4

"My four year old beagle loves the tug a jug! It was recommended by the shelter I adopted her from, and it keeps her busy. I give hre about a third of her meal in her bowl, and the rest in the tug a jug.  It took her a few tries to get the hang of it, but now she rolls it around and has learned to put her paw on the bumpy part to tip the jug up and empty the food out. It works great with her kibble (eukaneuba adult maintenance small bites) but she goes crazy when I put her high-value treats in it like little pieces of string cheese.<br /><br />There are two down sides - one, since the rope never comes out, the part inside the jug gets kind of gross with all the food. its a little hard to thoroughly wash, but it can be done. Two, I had her at my parent's house and they have tile floor.  She banged it hard enough to break the plastic on the end piece (it unscrews on the bottom of the jug to let you put the treats in) - so I suggest not using it on tile floor and of course, quality supervision.<br /><br />I leave it out after she is done with it and she often returns to it during the day just to check and see if she missed anything! Definitely recommend. However, I will saw that these products are significantly more expensive at Petsmart/Petco - I recommend Target, Amazon, or a local shelter's shop where the proceeds go back to animals in need.<br /><br />Enjoy!","Not for use on tile floors, but otherwise, amazing!",4

"The quality of all Eden organic beans is excellent.  Being preservative free with very little sodium (less than 100 mg per can), the flavor of the beans comes through and is excellent. This is particularly true of the kidney beans.<br /><br />The one small downside of the kidney beans is that they were a bit too soft; they tended to mash a bit more than I'd like, and they don't hold up well to boiling.<br /><br />Note that you'll find brown specks in some varieties of Eden beans.  Do not be alarmed: the specks are kombu (kelp), an organic sea plant that's used as a natural preservative.

"I tried the Yogi Kava Stress Relief tea after being a user of Valerian root in my herbal tea for a while a year or so ago and having some success with that but wanting to try something different - I was finding myself in a situation where on most days I needed to get up at one consistent time but then one day of the week I needed to get up three hours earlier, thus causing a great amount of upheaval in my sleep schedule the night before and then after that early morning.<br /><br />As some earlier reviewers have noted, there is a strong, almost metallic note to this tea. I have tried Stevia as a sweetener previously and had not particularly cared for it, but that did not seem to constitute the entire ""note"" that I was sensing and not finding pleasing here, so some of it must be the herb itself. However, this taste is not any more displeasing than Valerian is to my palate when I compare them.<br /><br />I steep two of the teabags for approximately 7-8 minutes with the water almost a boil when I add it to the tea (the instructions said that the tea could be steeped for as long as 10 minutes). I add just a splash of cream and a generous tablespoon of clover honey to mine, and within twenty minutes I feel the effects. Some have noted that they do not feel any differently - I can say that I do, but I should mention to be fair that I am a mere five feet two inches and barely clock in at above one hundred pounds.  Still, I would say that this is to its credit - it wouldn't put me to sleep if I used one teabag for test anxiety, which I foresee using it for in the very near future. Instead of knocking you out, it simply stops your mind from racing relentlessly, or at least that has been my experience.",Worked around the metallic taste,4

"I have for some years now been feeding my dog a blend of appetizing dog foods with a costly prescription diet for his medical condition. He doesn't always have much of an appetite, and it can be difficult to coax him into eating much. He won't eat the prescription diet unless there's something a little more tempting with it. I don't know; maybe once he gets started he doesn't pay as much attention to the individual elements.<br /><br />On opportunity for review, I picked this up along with a bag of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> to see how these two foods would work for this purpose, and how they'd compare.<br /><br />Either of them does the trick. He was enticed by the smell of the Beneful before I even opened the bag. Put a few pieces on the floor, and he went after it like a dog in a dog food commercial. He gave pretty much the same attention to the Chef Michael's. He doesn't seem much to care which I put in the bowl with the prescription food; he has so far chowed down on each just as happily.<br /><br />Even allowing for the lower portion sizes of Chef Michael, it costs twice as much. Nutritionally, there are some differences between the pair. Beneful has 25% crude protein (minimum); 10% crude fat (minimum); 4% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 14% moisture. Chef Michael has 28% crude protein (minimum); 16% crude fat (minimum); 3% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 12% moisture. I've been doing some reading on dog food ingredients, and while I'm no expert what I've read suggests that the Beneful is heavy on carbs and, while its top protein source (chicken by product; second on the list) is a decent protein, it's not necessarily a highly digestible food due to its heavy reliance on corn. Chef Michael starts with beef. Corn is much lower on the list, but the second and third ingredients are soybean meal and soy flour. I'm told the first of these is mostly a filler, with little nutritional value, while the second loses much nutritional value being converted from grain to flour.<br /><br />That considered, I'm not sure that the Beneful would be my first choice for mixing in with my dog's food, although in the right proportion I feel comfortable enough with it. Chef Michael feels a little better, but is expensive and not necessarily a big nutritional win. With his tricky health, I don't think I would use either of these solely, but they both do the trick. While neither is exactly a health food, I can't pretend that everything I eat is the healthiest option, either. These are decent supplements, but I personally would not use them as mainstays.","Evidently tasty dog food, but relatively high cost; not exactly health food",4

My 5 month old aussie/border collie mix puppy liked this game a lot. It's pretty durable. You hide the treats in the cups and your pup has to find them.

"The anchor of the Jim Beam small batch collection (the lowest price, shortest bottle, longest posted age in the barrel and the biggest sales of any small batch bourbon) Knob Creek is a big substantial bourbon that oozes class and quality. It begs to be sipped neat and slow. It stands up to the best bourbons without embarrassing itself.<br /><br />In the glass it's a rich spessarite garnet reddish orange with a tinge of henna. The redness is coming from the #4 char oak barrels. That's the darkest level of char. This char level shows up all over Knob creek - from the color to the nose to the last notes of the finish. Knob Creek's extensive time in the wood is a big part of its character and the fact that the wood was darkly charred is a big part of the wood's character.<br /><br />The nose brings up toffee, leather, and bitter orange. Further nosing brings out vanilla, cream, and some earth mustiness - like forest floor leaves and loam. It's a complex, appetizing, and pretty sophisticated nose for a bourbon that some folks don't respect enough, in my opinion, because it's so universally available.<br /><br />The initial taste on first sip is sweet with brown sugar and moassess. That's followed up by a big midpalate expansion spicy on the edges of the tongue with 100 proof and full of a sophisticated sherry quality. The finish is redolent with oak wood and a bitter orange note in the back of the tongue. There's char in the finish, vanilla, sandalwood perfume and a distant and pervasive backdrop of charcoal and creosote. You don't notice it at first but it builds up as you devour your glass. There's also a sour tang that shows up slowly over time that I have come to associate with Jim Beam. It's very subtle but it's the thread that binds the disparate Jim Beam stable together.<br /><br />This is a big, rough, very masculine bourbon. It's a frontier cabin with leather, musket, and wood fire raging. It's also elegant and refined - to a point. I have no trouble recommending it - but have to point out that Elija Craig 12 has a lot of the same flavor profile (but more sweet and less char) for substantially less money. In any case, you'll have no trouble finding Knob Creek and once you start sipping I sincerely doubt anyone would regret any part of it even for a minute.",Knob Creek is a big dense chewy bourbon with tons of character.,4

"For someone who is trying to slowly switch over from regular diet sodas/drinks to all natural diet substitutes, I have tried a variety of stevia flavored drinks (aka stevia sweetened sodas and teas). This my first time trying a powdered drink. And it's better than what I expected. I was bit wary after reading some of the reviews. You can add just a little bit and it's enough to sweeten my tea or just water. I am not a fan of drinking water (except fiji or while working out) and this can easily quench my thirst when I add the right amount. If I add too much its a mix between bitter and sweet and it's not that good. It's something I add for flavour and a great alternative for a healthy diet nut who likes tasty drinks. I would like to try the orange so I can add it to tea and make it DIY iced orange tea.",Pretty good for stevia,4
The product good. Delivery / Installation - Delivery was perfect. Installation was a BIG PROBLEM. I had to follow up for 2-3 weeks to get it installed. Apparently they were out of wall mount bracket.

"I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.","Great Tea, don't buy online",4

"Bernie, my 60-65 pound labrador retriever, loves these strips. I give her about 1 per day. The rawhide strips are on the order of 2-3 inches by 5-7 inches. They vary in thickness, but I'd say the majority of the strips are of slightly thin to normal thickness.<br /><br />The five pound bag is resealable, though it's not the toughest of plastics. I've received some bags that have some small holes from being punctured by the rawhide strips.<br /><br />The strips come from Brazil, purportedly from grass fed cows, which is excellent. I've noticed that most of the options I have in local stores are made in China. I'm not comfortable getting food products from China, given their recent past history with tainted pet foods.<br /><br />The Amazon price at more than a quarter of a Benjamin feels steep, though when you consider you're getting five pounds and consider the price per pound, it's actually a good value compared to local options (at least for me).",Bernie loves this treat.,4

"As thrilled as I was to get a package of this for trial from Vine, it is not the kind of treat I'd normally pick up for kitty. 1) I'm cheap. 2) we do not do wet food or the soft/chewy snacks at all and 3) she's gung ho with stuff like this, eats too fast and then it's a bit of a barf fest on the carpet...<br /><br />OK, so the package comes, a supposedly reusable zip baggy thing, but while I opened it easy enough the first time, day two was another matter and I ended up cutting it open and putting it in my own easier to open zip bag. So much for that. The package contains three sticks of tuna (dolphin safe and all that according to the info blurb), measuring about 4 1/2"" by 1"" by not quite 1/2"" and a bit of broth of some sort. They are rather dense/dry in texture and I recommend breaking it up a bit by fork (or your fingers if the smell doesn't bother). I'm treating these as a snack, and not as a meal. They are a bit chewy looking, so if you have an older cat and/or one who has difficulty chewing I'd think carefully on these.<br /><br />Kitty loves them, and boy does it keep her busy eating after I'm home and not bellowing at me for attention :)<br /><br />A solid five paws from her, and I'm knocking off a star for the packaging issues and the price(!!). I supposed those who have a lot of disposable income would lap this up like a cat with cream, but as I said... I'm cheap (or frugal, as the boss puts it).","Two paws up from kitty, but the packaging leaves a bit to be desired",4

"Well, this product is pretty self explanatory, and I'm not really sure who buys their nuts from Amazon.com, but when offered some by the Vine program in exchange, I couldn't say no (I love cashews!).  The only thing different about these cashews from your average roasted/salted cashews is the addition of black pepper.  I really did like the pepper addition, although plain salted cashews are still higher on my list.  The flavor is a bit stronger and I can only eat a few at a time.  I also think that if I ate enough of these salt and pepper nuts, I'd probably get sick of them and never want them again, so they're probably best in small doses.  Other than that, I'd say that the cashews themselves are good size and quality, and the roasting was perfect.",Cashews.,4

"When I opened the pouch, I sniffed the contents and found the aroma to be intensely complex and inviting! I tried a little pinch of it raw -- and it excited my taste buds -- very enjoyable. I even think that the contents would be spectacular if sprinked over vanilla or dulce de leche ice cream -- this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix is VERY gingery and sweet --- and with a nice lemon tang.<br /><br />So I dumped the remaining contents of the pouch into a cup and added hot water -- It steamed up very nicely, mixed VERY well and the first few sips were intense, delicious, just great. But THEN this mixture started burning my throat so intensely that I had to cut it with Soy Milk to turn off the overpowering heat -- turning the remainder of the contents into a refreshing, sweet, but mild experience.<br /><br />Now some people might LIKE all that extra heat-- I couldn't handle it. For those who like the Ginger/Lemon experience but are not fans of spicy hot-ness, then perhaps divvying up the contents of one pouch into TWO cups of tea would be a better way to enjoy this intense experience.",One packet might be better off making TWO cups,4

"My dogs have preferred these for years over the ""other one"" and need the small size.  The local store that had them changed to the medium awhile back and I put in a request for the small again.  Since this was not done I looked and found them here.  Actually a little less expensive as well.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have (which I think is not minor) is that all of the boxes were taped together.

"Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity ""candy corn""'aspect one often finds in bourbons. It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18. It's lovely. Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco. There's some leather and cream too. First sip opens bright with honeyed corn. Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect. Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke. It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best. The absence of ""corn likker"" fruitiness is most appreciated. This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.","Lithe and balanced, Woodford is a polished sophisticated bourbon.",4
"Kuding translates to ""bitter nail"" and honestly that really tells you a lot about the taste.  I drink this tea really from the perspective that you don't drink this tea for the taste, but the health benefits.  My knowledge on traditional medicine is really limited so I'll not go into it so that I'm not misleading anyone - but effectively this tea is supposed to help with too much body heat which manifests in a few different ways.  Drinking this tea tends to ""cool"" your body down and is supposed to help balance the fact that most people's diets do not include much that is bitter.  I found personally that after drinking this tea I tend to sweat less, and it helps me feel better.  The taste is something that will throw off most people, so I wouldn't advise this to most, it's incredibly bitter, but if you start with one nail and work your way up, you won't be overpowered.  The other thing is drink this tea while it's hot, it makes it much more bearable.",The name says it all,4

"ThinkThin are the best-tasting of the low-carb and gluten-free protein bars, in my opinion. They are now available at many more stores than when I ordered a box from Amazon awhile ago. And they are much cheaper at every store I've been to than the online price. At even Whole Foods, I typically pay $1.69 per bar, and get a slight discount for buying an entire box. Once you add shipping to Amazon's prices, they are more expensive online. Also, keep in mind the season when ordering them. All of the coatings had melted and were stuck to the packaging, then fell off in pieces when opened, due to having melted during shipment. But if you can get them locally, give them a try. There are many flavors to choose from, though most stores seem to only carry a few.<br /><br />Those people who claim they are awful tasting probably haven't tried other protein bars that are low-carb and gluten-free, and expect them to taste like candy bars or high-sugar bars that may be more tasty, but are also full of ingredients that render them nutritionally useless.","Good, but by locally, if possible",4

"I contacted Happy Bellies after purchasing what appeared to be a bad can at my local target. They responded within one business day. Below is an excerpt of their response to me. I thought other parents would appreciate this information.<br /><br />""I can tell you that this is a wholly organic, minimally processed product, and as such, it's subject to slight changes in the organic crop year, season, etc.  Also, since this is drum dried (thin film on a hot steel rolling dryer), changes in drum temp can occasionally cause more browning than normal.  Also, this product (BELLIES cereal) is on what's called a ""positive release"" program, which means that product cannot be released for sale until the required testing comes back acceptable.  The fact that it was for sale tells me it passed those tests...<br />Right now, I feel as though rough handling (trucks, forklifts, shelf stockers, etc.) has caused damage, most likely leading to a seam leak.  Since we flush the can with nitrogen, a seam leak allows air (oxygen) into the can, which can cause a set of oxidation reactions.  These are responsible for off flavours/colours/odours, but other than that, are harmless, and do not pose a food safety threat to your son.""<br /><br />I believe in this product and their commitment to customers.

"PORT SALUT ABBEY is truly scrumptious cheese! (Yum!).  I first got acquainted with Port Salut cheese years ago, when I was a member of ""CheeseLovers International"".  There, I not only bought delicious cheeses, but also became familiar with the term ""tyrophile"", which means ""cheese-lover"".  That certainly is one very accurate description of me!<br /><br />I not only became acquainted with Port Salut cheese, but also Royal Harvarti cheese -- both for the first time, via C.I.  I've had other Havarti cheese since, (no ""royal Harvarti"" could I find) -- and found it not to be as good as the Royal Havarti from the CheeseLovers International club.  However, this PORT SALUT ABBEY is every bit as good as the Port Salut I got from C.I. -- and even better!<br /><br />Although Port Salut does not list ""wine"" as one of its ingredients, it does have the slight, but distinctive taste of port wine.  ""Wispride"" and other cheese spreads have a port-wine version....and, though the winey flavour in Port Salut cheese is definitely present, (even without any wine being listed in the ingredients), it is much less strong than in the Wispride, or other port-wine cheese spread varieties.<br /><br />Slightly sweet, with tiniest hint of an egg-creme taste, (again, without egg-cream being listed on the label), Port Salut is a superb cheese for any and all occasions!<br /><br />This Port Salut Abbey Cheese was even better than the Port Salut cheese I bought from Cheeselovers International, because it was much creamier --and probably fresher, as well.<br /><br />I give this cheese only four stars, (although the TASTE merits ten -- if not 196 stars.  That's one for each year since Port Salut was invented, according to the label, which says, ""Depuis 1819"", for this French-made, pasteurized cheese.<br /><br />The reason for only four stars is this: The weight of this cheese is listed as 5 pounds here on Amazon.  The carton it comes in, (wonderfully sdecure, and also wonderfully easy to open! : ) says it weighs 4.99 pounds.  However, on the cheese itself, the weight is listed as only 4 3/4 pounds!  This prompts a rhyme from me,<br />that goes:  ""Nibble?  Who is nibbling, please?  Don't take ounces off my cheese?""<br /><br />This is NOT to infer that any entity, (mouse, human, or whatever), has been ""nibbling"" at this cheese -- only to wonder at the short-weighing of this cheese.  In these days of high food prices, (and higher shipping rates), every ounce counts!<br /><br />I bought the 5 pound wheel, (or what I thought was a 5 pound wheel), precisely because of the higher shipping rates for smaller wheels.  In fact, I bought THREE 5-pound wheels for this very reason: Three-five pound wheels, (with shipping costs), bring the price down from approximately $17 per pound, to $14 per pound.<br />Of course, this has to be recalculated if the wheel is not 5 pounds, but only 4 and 3/4 pounds.  Still, this is a LOT better than the one-pound wheel, which, with shippping costs, comes out to an astonishing $23.00 a pound!<br /><br />Today, people are looking for bargains -- even in luxury goods.  (At least I am.)<br />I have, in fact, put a 15 pound wheel of Swiss cheese on my wish list.  It is not presently available, and perhaps never will be...but I have cast my vote here, for buying in bulk and saving money!  I see here that only four more 5-pound wheels are presently available -- and hope, fervently, that this does not mean the end of the 5-pound, (or even 4 3/4 pound), wheel!  Fourteen dollars a pound is a lot to pay -- but compared to $23 a pound, it is a positive bargain!  I respectfully suggest that five-pound wheels continue to be sold, for economy's -- (and sales!) -- sake(s).  Perhaps to make this delicious cheese even more tempting, a SLIGHTLY higher price could be charged for buying 5 1-pound wheels, together. Slightly higher than the price for a whole 5 pound wheel -- but much less, hopefully, than five one-poound wheels bought singly.<br /><br />This is truly SCRUMPTIOUS cheese.  For those who do not drink wine, (or who do not want to drink wine every time they eat this cheese....yet DO want something to drink with it), I would like to suggest drinking BLACK TEA, or COLA with it!  The<br />Tea -- and especially Cola -- might seem to be slightly, er....plebian...when drunk with this gourmet cheese.  But remember, no one is really ""above it all"",<br />that just about EVERYONE has eaten fast-food fare, that ""nice guys"" not only usually win, but also sleep better at night, that ""being one of the people"" is guaranteed to win more votes......and that cheese -- any cheese -- tastes quite GOOD when accompanied by drinking tea and/or cola!<br /><br />Eating Port Salut cheese is something everyone should have a chance to do -- even if only once in their lives.  Bon Appetite!  : ),",W O U L D .....B E.....1 0.....S T A R S......I F......,4

"I'm still learning how (or whether) to use these gels in training or racing.  I just downed a PowerBar Gel (strawberry-banana, 1X caffeine) following a 10K race plus an extra 4 mile training run.  I do forget the exercise physiology here... am I supposed to use DURING the run, before, or after?  I've got a half marathon coming up next week, so I'm most concerned about injury and cramp prevention at this stage.  But I've also got a 188 mile team race coming up, where I have to run 3 stages.  Last year, I used this gel between my segments (plus peanut butter sandwiches and gobs of fluids).<br /><br />Here's what I know.  This PowerBar Gel is easy to consume (even the green apple flavor... you won't treat it as a candy).  I haven't had any leakage problems yet, and it is easy to use: squeeze and swallow.  However, I really can't tease out any real benefits due to the product, or whether I'm experiencing a placebo effect.  In fact, I wonder whether you have to be a very fine athlete, pushing your body to the limits, for there even to be a measurable effect.<br /><br />In other words, are these gels just adult pacifiers?<br /><br />Well, I probably need all the help I can get.  I'm not sure about the 0, 1X, or 2X caffeine content.  The caffeine can't be for recovery, can it?  So it is a minor, legal stimulant?<br /><br />As long as I can get these for about a dollar per unit, the taste isn't bad, and they don't break and leak, I'll keep using them.

Easy to use machine that works well making espresso or just an single cup of coffee. The only complaint I have is if you are using a large cup for regular coffee you have to angle putting in and removing the cup since the bottom of the drip spouts are not high enough even when adjusting the pull-down or push-up spout that is provided. This is a well priced unit for what it provides you. You can adjust the grind of the beans but it comes manufacturer set for a medium grind. It comes with lights that once turn solid green let you know that you are ready to use whatever function you choose and dial for adjusting espresso to a full cup of coffee is clearly marked and easy to read. Steam is provided when pressing the 3rd button on - when it is off you get very hot water dispensed. The area for grinding the beans handles a lot so if you like switching types of coffee then you have to keep only the amount for what you are using in the grinder since there is no way of easily switching coffee beans once the container is full. Overall I would recommend it for anyone who likes to prepare their own coffee because of it's price and ease of use.,Saeco Vienna Plus Expresso Machine,4

That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it.<br /><br />Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.

"Upon first opening the box, I noticed it has a peanut butter like smell. It reminded me faintly of Crackerjacks. The cereal is crunchy and lightly sweet. Depending on your opinion on sugar, you could find this too sweet or not sweet enough. The airy consistency reminded me of Kellogg's Pops. I liked that they remained crunchy from start to finish.<br /><br />I would say that it needs more nuts to carry off the ""Crunchy Nut"" name. There are probably the flakes of like ten peanuts in this entire box. It doesn't taste very nutty at all. I think the airy consistency would have been nicely complimented by the solid crunch of whole nuts.<br /><br />The cereal has a 100 calories, 10 g of sugar, 1 g of fat, and 11 g of carbs. It has no more than 25 percent of any vitamins or nutrients. The taste is obviously the best feature. It's pretty good. By the time I finish the box, I might like it better.

Unlike the kimchi flavor, this has enough spices to satisfy your craving and since I do not dislike udon noodles, I give it 4 stars.  But it is not as good as Ramyun picante and I give ramyun 5 stars.  My boyfriend is german / irish American and he loves these noodles...even this spicy neoguri.

"I first found these at our local ""mart"" store (you know which one) but they are often out of stock totally or only have one flavor.<br />This flavor, the apple cinnamon is good, but not my favorite. It's basically just applesauce with cinnamon like you can buy in the big jars, but this has no preservatives, colorings, additives, water dairy or gluten-nothing artificial...just apples and cinnamon, but the texture is much smoother than regular applesauce. It's not as smooth as baby food, but somewhere in the middle. It's extremely convenient for on the go, for kids *no spill and it has a cap!*, trips etc. They're a little spendy..in fact, more so here than at the local store, which is strange, but worth it to have the type you want, when you want it. I actually think my husband and I like it more than my 2nd grader! My personal favorite is the apple/strawberry flavor. I'm not a banana fan, so i haven't tried that flavor.<br />This brand also makes pure fruit bites, which are basically fruit snacks, but without added sugar, preservatives or anything but 100% fruit..and best of all in my opinion, NO GELATIN! They're very yummy, more so than sugary fruit snacks...they're a little tart which is nice. It's so great to have good snack food options, they're a great, fun way to get your daily fruits in.

"I'm a daily cereal consumer. My wife is a health fanatic so I eat mainly organic cereal with very little sugar and as little refinement as possible.

(Compare with Kellogg's Fruit Loops at 12g of sugar per 1 cup serving). Although it looks like Cheerios with nuts on it, it is not - the texture is heavier and crunchier and the taste is completely different. The nuts add a nice touch even though it would probably taste great without them. The vitamin content is quite high which means they probably fortified the cereal although I see nothing on the box that states this.<br /><br />As I said I enjoyed trying this cereal but knowing my wife (bless her heart) she won't be buying this cereal for me any time soon.

"This was the first time I had ever tried Matcha Tea. I read the reviews and thought it sounded great. I decided to pay the high price for this tea because of the reviews it got. I was absolutely shocked when I received the tea, however. It comes in a tiny tin. Inside the tiny tin is a tiny foil pouch. Inside the tiny foil pouch is a silicone packet to keep the tea dry. There was a lot of tea ""stuck"" to this little packet. So basically you get about two tablespoons of tea, if that, for well over $20. To me it looked like a ""sample"" product that would be worth a couple of dollars.<br /><br />Yes, the tea is a lovely shade of green. I made my own recipe of chai spices with ginger, cloves and cinnamon. I added frothed, unsweetened almond milk. It was good, but not good enough to justify paying that much. Fortunately I am never dissatisfied with Amazon.com because, as always, they offer immediate refunds for products that don't live up to their standards of customer satisfaction.<br /><br />I'm going to try another organic green tea that is highly rated next time. I probably won't be able to tell any difference. I'm sure this product is good tea. The question is whether or not it's so much better than the other highly-rated green teas that it is worth close to $24 for a couple of cups. For me it is not. This is yet another experience with Amazon that proves I can't go wrong buying through them. Thanks, Amazon, for truly making shopping a risk-free adventure.<br /><br />I am now editing my original review and I have changed the rating from 2 to 4 stars. There is no other matcha tea like this one. It gives me energy. It tastes great. The kind of energy it gives me is a sense of calm, well-being, and energy without any jittery feeling. It lasts many hours, but I don't ""crash."" I like it, and it's worth the extra money. I will be ordering it again.","Great tea, but very small tin.",4

Adding a side dish of broccoli, a salad and a fruit dessert makes this a filling, healthy meal.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+Doesn't taste like it came from a box, SECONDS were requested!<br />+Easily modifiable - you can substitute a pound of leftover chicken, ground chicken or even fresh chicken thigh meat pieces<br />+At less than THREE bucks a box, it's worth having on hand to jazz up a quick meal.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I wish microwave instructions were available on the box or from Kraft Customer Service...It's nearly a month of 100 degree days. We're encouraged to use microwave ovens rather than regular stoves and ovens during 2-7 PM electricity usage peak to reduce usage and stress on the ""electric grid"".","Easy, Cheesy and Yummy",4

"This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear. Overall, this is a good anti-dandruff shampoo and I would recommend it.",good anti-dandruff shampoo,4

"I've tried most of the organic bars on the market to date. I consider the ""Organic Food Bar""  brand to be the gold standard, and I've enjoyed them for years. The Raw Revolution bars are proving to be just as good, and they are considerably cheaper. At the moment, Amazon is tied for the cheapest price I've seen for Organic Food Bars: 0.97 cents/ounce.<br />Amazon has the cheapest price I've seen for Raw Revolution bars: 0.60 cents/ounce! That is over a 30% difference. Its 1.31 for a 2.2 oz bar. Retail is 1.99/bar; and that is what they are on the Raw Revolution website, too.<br /><br />I love the taste; it had not occurred to me that some folks wouldn't like them until I read some of the reviews here. Then again, it is easy for me to learn to like foods that are healthy. Both of these bar lines seem high in fat to me (my dieting Mom won't eat them), but it is all healthy fat. I would like to see more of a Zone diet ratio (more protein).  They could have a bit less sweet for my taste, but that goes for every bar I've ever tried.<br /><br />Its funny (and makes so much sense) that Raw Revolution has so many chocolate flavors. Also, the Raw Revolution folks I met at the Outdoor Retailer show were some of the nicest folks; very liberal with their samples, too ;-).<br /><br />I wish that health food stores (and online merchants) would post the price per ounce for the plethora of bars that are out there. Maybe they don't want to draw attention to how expensive many of these products are! I am very resistant to paying over a dollar an ounce for bars, especially when these all organic, high quality bars are less than that.<br /><br />So the dollar an ounce limit for a 2.4 ounce bar is $2.40; for a 2.2 ounce bar it is $2.20, and so forth.<br /><br />For good bars that are only .41/ounce on Amazon, you can't beat Clif bars, 70% organic; a good staple. Probably the healthiest food at 7-11, if you're hungry and stuck. Clif Builder bars (chocolate) are good too; more of a ""normal"" chocolate crunchy bar.<br />Cheers!<br />Wasatch Bill",Best overall organic bar,4

"I've heard people for years rave about Malomars, so how could I resist tasting what all the fuss was about? First made in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1913 (now made in Canada), the package states that 70% of these cookies are sold ""in the shadow of the Big Apple"". Eighteen cookies in the carton, 2 cookies per serving at 120 calories, 5g of fat; unfortunately there's high fructose corn syrup, so I won't buy more.<br /><br />The cookie itself? A B+ in my book. There's a good sweet dark chocolate shell around a fluff of marshmallow atop a cookie. The chocolate and marshmallow are very good together. The cookie has a good flavor but is overpowered by the other two, and it crumbles too much -- I always wind up sprinkled with crumbs; at the end there's a slightly salt finish. Very nice. I can see why people like these, but I'd probably take an Oreo first.",delightful cookie .... but very crumbly,4

"I purchased this Lick your Chops Delicacy in the Chicken and Catfish flavor. The ingredient list sounded like a ""to die for"" mix of things that my kitties would like. When the case arrived and I opened the first can, I was appalled. It looked like your average cheepo catfood. It is a ""pate"" type formulation with everything ground together and molded into the can. My 4 cats get 7, three oz cans per night for their dinner rations. Needless to say, Dinner is an exciting time at my house. But I put this pate in the bowl with a sinking hear. I figured that I had just bought a case that would end up with the recsue kitties as a donation.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surpirised. The first night the kitties had this, the entire bowl was eaten, so the ingredients and taste must be good, though they are indistinguishable! The second night I put this out, about an eigth of the can remained at the end of the day. I had given this choice on consecutive days. My kitties are quite spoiled and ONLY a FEW things will be eaten two nights in a row.<br /><br />So I waited a week, and, sure enough, the third can was eaten in its entirety. So I give this four stars. I try to give 5 only to the foods they will eat everyday, everytime. So, If I have to strectch out the offerings, I only give 4 stars. My kitties agree and say ""thank you"" from Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty.",Chicken and Catfish,4

"Okay, so I've had this product for a week or more, and I gotta say... it's pretty darn good. I had just finished my last pack of Senseo pods, and this came in just at the nick of time (phew); so I couldn't wait to try this out with some grounds that I had.<br /><br />So, here was the con: the water would not run through the filter, and I ended up with water all over my counter. So, I, half-asleep start to freak and get this mess cleaned up. I try again, thinking maybe I didn't have the filter in correctly... low and behold, water all over the place again. ARGH!<br /><br />My daughter, who is not a coffee drinker, says to me (after laughing hysterically at my coffee catastrophe) that maybe the coffee is too big for the basket. Hmm, could that really be the case, could an 8y.o. really know more about this machine than I?!?!.<br /><br />So, I grind the grounds a bit more fine (using a food processor for a quick fix), and try again. Yes, I was crossing my fingers that I wouldn't be cleaning a mess again. And by golly, the machine worked just perfect. No issues, hiccups, or spills of any sort.<br /><br />Alright... so here is my two cents... these filters are good, and it will save my wallet in the long run.

"I give this 5 stars if you like the taste of whole grain pasta... whole grain pasta has a pretty strong, distinctive flavor if you're used to regular ol' non-whole-grain pasta, and that flavor isn't hidden by this sauce.  If you already know that you don't like the taste of whole grain pasta, these meals aren't for you.  I'm a picky eater so I couldn't really get past the whole grain pasta, but my husband ended up eating all of it and he really liked it.<br /><br />This cooked quickly (which is great on lunch break!) and the sauce and the pasta cook separately, then you mix them together when they're hot.  I like this preparation, as it kept the pasta from getting gummy.  The pasta was nicely done, slightly chewy, and the sauce was good and there's plenty of it (other reviewers have said that there wasn't enough sauce, but that wasn't the case for me, and I like it saucy).<br /><br />This isn't really the most economical pasta & sauce lunch option, I'm sure getting a pound of pasta, cooking it, and adding a jar or two of pasta sauce would be cheaper, but these Barilla meals are about convenience.  I'll buy a few of them and have my husband take them to work to keep in his desk, for those days when he forgets to grab his lunch bag from the kitchen counter on his way out the door in the morning.",Saucy with nice pasta,4

I've recently changed a lot of my eating habits in order to lose weight and cutting calories was key in my plans. PB2 was recommended to me by a friend who knew how much I loved peanut butter but had been abstaining from it due to the high calorie count.

The product mixes together very well and the calorie deficit when compared to normal peanut butter makes this a no-brainer. Give it a try!,Great Healthy Alternative,4

"Sugar is very useful, definitely needed in making certain food products, and has it's place, and boy do I enjoy the natural pleasure of eating sweets and dessert now and then, but I try not to consume too much of it for the obvious health reasons and have been buying stevia, a good all natural sugar substitute for quite a while now, purchasing it in liquid form.  I recently discovered PureVia two or three months ago in the grocery department of a local chain store and purchased it to give it a try, hoping this brand, and powder version of stevia would measure up.  I was satisfied with its effectiveness to sweeten my coffee, various teas and cereal and also with the convenient individual packets, and have been buying the 80-count box ever since.  When I ran out of it this last time I checked online for availability and was very pleased to find the same PureVia brand available on Amazon.com., where I found it available in an 800-count box which should not only last me (theoretically) ten times longer than my usual 80-count box but at a price that actually saved me between $15 and $16 bucks! ... pleasing THIS life-long bargain hunter BIG TIME.<br /><br />Re shipping:  I believe it was delivered a day or so later than the estimated ETA but I think it was delayed because it was delivered with the shipping box a bit damaged.  One end of the box was slightly crushed and had been re-taped due to conspicuous insufficient interior packing paper inside the shipping box.  Fortunately, PureVia's product box was completely intact and not damaged in any way.<br /><br />So aside from a small delivery annoyance, this was obviously a very good buy.

"****<br /><br />First, this drink, illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12), definitely tastes like coffee as opposed to, say, tea or ketchup or turkey gravy.  Also, because I'm a bit of a coffee connoisseur (grind my own beans, ingeniously mix various varieties, use a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTMHRW"">Chemex 10 Cup Classic Glass Coffee Maker</a>, that sort of thing), I think I stand on pretty firms grounds here when I say this no standard brew haha.  It is much nearer the bitter end of the scale.<br /><br />Yet it is also sweet.  I don't know about you, but, first, to me the very idea of adding sugar to coffee is like adding honey to tea or ketchup to a bratwurst or turkey gravy to a filet mignon.  I like it!<br /><br />Speaking of which, according to the description on the Amazon page this product is ""sweetened with beet [sic] sugar.""  First, I think they mean ""beaten"" sugar, not ""beat sugar.""  That would be like saying molt lava instead of molten lava.  Also, they spelled ""beat"" wrong anyway.  Sheesh.  I don't subtract any stars for this, I just thought it was worth noting.<br /><br />****<br /><br />PRICE ERROR<br /><br />As of this writing there's another error in the description.  You get 12 6.8-ounce cans for $24.13, which is said to be 29 cents per ounce.  But if you do the math you get quite a different result.<br /><br />Oh heck, here, let me do it for you.<br /><br />6.8 ounces time 12 cans equals 81.6 ounces.  $24.13 times 100 equals 2,413 cents.  2,413 cents divided by 81.6 ounces per 12-pack equals exactly 29.5710784313725490196 cents per ounce (*where the least significant 16 digits repeat, and also which the decimal portion of which is equal to exactly 233 divided by 408, which as if you didn't know).<br /><br />As we round that number to less and less precision we discover that the 7 in the hundredths place forces the 5 in the tenths place to round up to 6.  And if you round 29.6 cents to some integral unit you are forced to round up to 30 cents; you may not round down to 29 cents.<br /><br />First, this is just plain false advertising.  I find it interesting, nay, suspicious, that the error just happens to be in the manufacturer's favor.  If you were to order a million cans of illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) that difference would make a difference, and here's the proof.<br /><br />A million cans at 6.8 ounces per can = 6,800,000 ounces.  At the incorrect stated price of 29 cents per ounce, the total would be 197,200,000 cents, which is $1,972,000.  But in fact, as I'm sure you'll remember, the price is 29.5710784313725490196* cents per ounce, which results in a total price for a million cans of $2,010.833.3333.<br /><br />[ 29 + ( 408 / 433 ) ] * 6,800,000<br />= 201,083,333.333 cents<br />= $2,010,833.33<br /><br />That's a difference of a whopping $38,833.33.  I don't know about you, but every time someone asks me whether I want a discount of nearly $39,000, I always say that I very much do.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that if you place an order for a million cans of this product and promise to pay up front in cash the manufacturer won't consider offering you some sort of deal, maybe throw in a free Coca-Cola mouse pad or something.  I'm just saying that the price per ounce as stated on the Amazon description page is incorrect, and I'm curious as to why.  Whatever the answer is, I don't see how it can be satisfactory.  So first, if you find out, let me know by composing a Comment at the bottom of this review.<br /><br />****<br /><br />CAFFEINE<br /><br />According to the Mayo Clinic web site, an 8.4-ounce can of Red Bull contains 76 to 80 milligrams of caffeine, which I will hereby fearlessly average to 78.  78 mg divided by 8.4 is 9.2857 mg per ounce.  The product under review contains 155 mg of caffeine per 6.8-ounce can, which works out to 22.7941 mg per ounce, so the percentage by which illy issimo is more caffeinated is calculated like this.<br /><br />(22.7941 - 9.2857) / 9.2857<br />= 13.5084 / 9.2857<br />= 1.455<br /><br />So, despite what any previous or future reviewer might putatively or may allegedly say or have said, this illy issimo contains about 145% more caffeine per ounce than Red Bull.<br /><br />But first, maybe we should be more interested in the total caffeine per can, not per ounce, because most people aren't going to choose between drinking all of a 6.8-ounce can of illy issimo on the one hand and, in, er, ON the other hand, drinking only 80.95% of an 8.4-ounce can of Red Bull; most people are going to drink all of whichever can they happen to have at hand.  If that's what we're measuring, here's the math.<br /><br />(155 mg - 78 mg) / 78 mg<br />= 77 / 78<br />= 0.98717<br />=98.7%<br /><br />98.7% is so close to 1 that what this means is that you get the same number of milligrams of caffeine from a can of Red Bull as from a can of illy issimo.<br /><br />****<br /><br />THE NAME<br /><br />Speaking of which, the name illy issimo is multiply confusing.  First, it doesn't have any capital letters, which I secretly regard as presumptuous but for which I subtract no stars, although in a better world I would.  It begs a typical speaker of English to think the first part of it refers the word ill, which means you're sick, i.e., you have some medical condition you wish you didn't have, which seems like a poor choice for the first name of a product designed for the sole purpose of being ingested into the body.<br /><br />The whole word ""illy"" is indeed the legitimate if somewhat unusual adjectival form of that word ill.  Illy means poorly or badly, as in, ""Her review of that product was illy received by the manufacturer"" or (more or less literally depending on how you interpret it), ""He performed illy on his first autopsy.""<br /><br />That first word illy, especially because it is uncapitalized, begs native speakers of English to fill in a first letter, and the choices are billy, dilly, filly, hilly, and silly.  I'll tell you that the first possibility that popped into my own personal mind was silly.<br /><br />With all these problems potentially in English speakers' minds, I my own personal self would have voted against the choice of the word illy to headline the name of this product or any other, if I had been asked, which I wasn't, which is no doubt why it is named what it is, which is no good reason to subtract any stars, which I won't.<br /><br />Still.<br /><br />****<br /><br />KOSHER!<br /><br />illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) is declared to be ""Kosher Certified.""  First and most important, that means if you restrict yourself to cans of coffee that have been kashered, you may safely drink this product without risking any bad outcomes that would arise if you didn't.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I don't want my diet controlled by centuries-dead people -- people who couldn't possibly have had access to all the information that's now available about foods and nutrition -- who espoused antediluvian rules that proscribe meat that comes from ""any animal that has cloven hoofs and doesn't ruminate,"" which excludes from their prescribed diet such extraordinarily useful food as pigs.  That so many people in 2012 refuse to eat pork products is astonishing to me.  And I don't want my diet controlled by a rule that dairy products and meat may not meet, which I'm pretty sure 100% rules out a properly prepared cheddar cheeseburger, which I'm pretty sure I will never rule out of my life as long as I can operate an outdoor grill or a simple stove.  I'm sure I should, by which I mean I'm sure I should forgo the cheese, but not for illy and capricious reasons but rather for health reasons, but the point is that this product IS kosher, so if you care about that then you have my blessing to go nuts.<br /><br />I award 4 stars because this product delivers what it says it will unless you order a million cans, in which case you're out $38,833.33.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Did you notice that eight times in the review above I started with ""First,"" implying at some point a ""Second,"" but that I never delivered even once?",Why it's only 4 stars,4

"Illy's Issimo Caffe Coffee Drink is an espresso flavored canned coffee. As such, it has a strong flavor.  By itself, the drink may be a little too strong for all but the most dedicated espresso fans. The drink, however, mixed well with milk and extra sweetener to produce a good tasting coffee beverage. Also, when poured from the can into a glass, it produced a beautifully thick foam.",Coffee Shop Alternative a Welcome Treat,4

"I'm very picky about my cookies, especially oatmeal and chocolate chip. I greatly prefer homemade over store-bought, and I will frequently turn down a store bought cookie.<br /><br />I would have a hard time turning down Quaker's chocolate almond oatmeal cookie!<br /><br />These do not have the over-processed taste of many boxed chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies. The texture is perfect, and they are pretty close to home-baked goodness! My only complaint about the taste of the cookie is that the chocolate and almonds are sparse. The size of the bits as shown on the box is pretty accurate, but more numerous than what we found to actually be in each cookie. Some cookies only had two or three bits each of chocolate and almond. For a cookie that is rather large like this one, I would increase the nuts and chocolate by at least 50%, but preferably a whole lot more.<br /><br />In all honestly, six large cookies in each box makes this a rather impractical packaging for our family of five. But, the cookies are good, so they will definitely go on our list for times when we are out and about and can't just whip up a batch of homemade chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies.",As Close to Homemade as I've Ever Tasted!,4

"It is impossible to find organic dried milk and we are 100% organic in our house.  I use this milk for making bread and in my pancakes.

"Good stuff. My dogs have been eating this for several years and they seem to like it better than some other brands I had tried. I stuck with this food because, well, the dogs like it, but also because it's one of the few canned dog foods that don't cause either digestive or allergy issues with either of my 2 dogs. It's nice to have the mix of flavors so they're not eating the same flavor every morning. They eat this for breakfast then they eat the same brand of dry varieties the rest of the day.

"The ingredients list on this is decent...first ingredient listed is beef.  There are still a lot of fillers (grains and meals) and several vitamins with 28% crude protein.  My test doggie liked it...didn't love it.  She wasn't sure at first about some of the pieces...set them aside and ate them later (she's not a picky eater).<br /><br />I prefer the Cal Ranch high protein dog food for an active dog (44% protein).  It costs way less too.  For dogs who do fine on most anything I'll just stick with Dog Chow...I can't see a difference with ""higher quality"" dog foods for most of my dogs.  Only the sled dogs/very active dogs and dogs with trouble keeping weight on seem to do better with higher protein foods.  Less active dogs just get fat on them.  I do supplement with a good amount of raw meat and fresh fruits/vegetables.  Something like this may be good for dogs who don't get good supplements to dry food.",Decent Dog Food,4

"I've always had a soft-spot for pasta and cheese because when I was raising my six children it was an easy, economical solution for a quick meal that they all liked. For some reason unknown to adults, kids do tend to like pasta and cheese in all its variations much better than adults do. I used to prepare the macaroni and cheese (no hamburger) for them with a salad and a half sandwich or a plain burger. Simple and easy...<br /><br />Ease of preparation is one of the reasons I got this product. The other reason is that when I saw the burger bits on the package it reminded me of good ol' juicy cheeseburgers that I loved in my younger days. Even though I don't eat them now, there was a time when I scarfed those cheeseburgers down...with big slices of raw onion. Yummy! Anyway, this dish blends together in a taste reminiscent of a cheeseburger and is very tasty. A bit too salty, but since I won't be eating it often, it won't harm me.<br /><br />In summation, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80O4"">Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit, 12.86-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> passes the taste test, the ease-of-preparation test and since one box is enough for five people, it also passes the economical test. What more could anyone ask for in a hurried meal?<br /><br />It hits the spot!<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, September 26, 2011<br />Author of ""Dream Reachers"" series of books (with Chase Von)",An old stand-by hits the spot!,4

"I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!",Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor,5

"Great product, BUT!!!!! It's a little tricky to figure out the best time needed for YOUR microwave oven. Ours is pretty strong, and 1 minute 40 to 50 seconds is about right. However, BE WARNED! If you have an inexpensive or ""low power"" oven, the results will be very poor at best. (Just ask the crew where I work) When I tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven, it was SUPER slow to expand, and after the better part of 4 minutes, the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the break room open for the rest of the afternoon! Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling. Otherwise they will seem stale until they cool. All this sounds like a pile of work, but after the first couple bags, you will NEVER buy pork rinds at the store again. I get a discount on the price because I have a box sent automatically every month. Works out to just under $13.00 a box with free shipping. Enjoy!","Great product, BUT!",5

"These sardines are a basic stocked item in my pantry. They are a fast protein pick-up that is low calorie, low salt, and low fat. I always have a can with me at work. Also,for cat lovers, my cat has kidney issues, and living in the desert she is additionally at risk for dehydration. So, besides some amazing homeopathic pills and organic cat food (that I buy from Amazon,) I give her the liquid from these super,no-salt added sardines, and the liquid is like a miracle fluid. Obviously she laps up the liquid within a short time (plus a bit of a sardine) and I can see and feel that she is doing better. I used to love the Season brand sardines as well, but Amazon dropped them from their subscription program. By the way, I called Reese up and they told me these are wild-caught sardines, which is a concern of mine, as I will not buy farm-raised fish. As far as the sardines go they are firm, lovely whole pieces, which are moist and tasty.",Low Sodium Sardines Serve Multiple Purposes,5

"After having gastric bypass, I find that I really miss the ""crunch"" of crackers. After looking for a good whole grain cracker with low or no sugar, and low in carbs, I stumbled across this cracker and decided to try it. I AM SOLD!! This cracker is just what the right cracker. Its made of all healthy ingredients, all good grains. Yes it has carbs, but they are healthy carbs and only 10 grams for 2 crackers, which are good size cracker. I will eat 2 or 3 crackers with cheese or tuna, or sometimes peanut butter (for the protein) and I am full.<br /><br />I took the package to my doctor, and he said it was a good healthy cracker.

"Many popular sports drinks have a lot of sodium and glucose as well as other electrolytes and stuff. Their flavoring frequently is nasty.<br /><br />ZICO Coconut Water on the other hand is water with a pleasant coconut flavor and a natural blend of sugars and nutrients found within green coconuts. There's far less sodium than in other sports drinks, lots of potassium, and it can also be mixed with fruit juice to add some nice flavor to complement it (mango and orange are good additions).<br /><br />After raking leaves for a few hours in the hot Florida sun, this stuff not only tastes better, it seems to hydrate faster as well, I feel refreshed and ready for more work quicker than with the regular sports drinks.",Hydrates better than sports drinks AND tastes better!,5

Before I ordered it I did not realize what Ghee actually was. Once we received are VERY TIMELY shipment of Ghee, I put it in the kitchen cabinet and waited for a first use. My husband had run out of coconut oil, which we do most of our cooking with and so he turned to the Ghee. And we haven't turned back! The flavor is amazing and it is good for you. Particularly, I really like this seller of Ghee because it is natural and grassfed. Good work!",Exactly as described,5

But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.

"Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods.

"Few things are as enjoyable in life as freshly popped pork rinds.  Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don't ""pop"" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn't find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is ""man nachos"".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn't stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don't let em sit too long or they get soggy.",Snap crackle and pop of pork rinds,5

I am a type 1 diabetic for 38 years.  I have always had spikes in my blood sugar whenever I ate pasta (pizza too). I watched an episode of Dr. Oz last year and really thought this stuff would taste like crap. How often does healthy things taste good?? LOL Did I mention that I am Italian and that I grew up in NYC?  I cannot eat crappy pizza or pasta.  I figured I would give this a try and go right back to my semolina pasta after the first taste test.  I was completely amazed that I really enjoy this pasta and what I enjoy even more than eating it is how it doesn't make my blood sugar difficult to control.  I actually take less insulin to cover this pasta then I had to with the semolina.  If you are diabetic and would like a great tasting pasta that does not make your blood sugar spike then try this pasta.  I am certain that you will see a difference.  It is also a lot healthier than semolina too.,Pasta for Diabetics,5

Because they are soft, you can mold it easily around the pill, using just the amount needed to cover the pill. This way you can get maximum use out of each pocket & they last longer.",Greenie Pill Pockets,5

Any dog puppy to senior and any breed dog loves these treats.  They go crazy over them!!!  They are healthy too.  I have been buying them for a few years now.

"I live in a very dry, very windy climate - so dry skin is a problem.  My scalp gets real dry and I seriously hate dandruff.  Historically I have used head and shoulders and have found it to be adequate.  After having used this stuff for 10 days, here is what I like about it:<br />1. It works just as well, if not better than, H&S.<br />2. I like the scent.<br />3. I like the bottle, it is not as easily recognized by guests as the bold blue & white H&S that everybody instantly recognizes as anti-dandruff shampoo - nobody wants to advertise that they have dandruff.<br />4. I like that it is concentrated and lasts a long time.<br />5. I like the price.",I like it,5

"Update on 09-03-2010:  I recently learned (by reading) that the natural sweetener Xylitol is poisonous for dogs to ingest.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Too bad I can't rate this product with ten stars! Manufactured in Sweden, these are appreciated around the world. Why do I appreciate them so much? What are they like? Well, here goes:<br /><br />Sugar free with only 3 calories per serving, they are sweetened with xylitol, which occurs naturally in the fiber of many fruits and vegetables. Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste, and doesn't impact blood sugar, so diabetics can enjoy them. With these, I haven't noticed any tummy discomfort as I do with Sorbitol or Aspartame. I don't really consider these as candy in the normal sense, but more as a refreshment. These pastilles are a wonderful treat that can help prevent cavities by keeping the saliva flowing. This is especially helpful for those of us who are stressed, have a medical condition or take medications that can cause dry mouth. These pastilles are firm but chewy, and also melt in one's mouth. There are no sharp edges which can occur with some hard candies.<br /><br />The taste is distinctive, rich and pleasurable, with notes of licorice and menthol.  A serving is two pieces, with a total of 12 servings per box (which is small enough to discreetly carry in a pocket or purse.)<br /><br />Lakerol Special Licorice pastilles come in handy, too.  Ever need to change the subject in a hurry? Offer one of these. Got the munchies at 2:00 a.m. but want to wake up free of guilt? Forget the cake and have a couple of these instead! Mouth going dry on your way to the principal's office? (Or enrolled in a speech class?) No problem. These will help!  Bored stiff trying to do your taxes? Lakerol and a stroll away from your desk will help refresh you... and with luck you will think of a couple more deductions.<br /><br />If you suffer from arthritis or any other source of chronic pain as I do (ankylosing spondylitis), these may help distract you from the pain and help you proactively focus on doing something kind and positive for yourself, such as gentle stretching or a hot bath.<br /><br />These do have menthol, but are not overwhelmingly strong, which is a nice plus. If you have a sensitive mouth, as I do, this can be very comforting. Also, I'm a chocoholic, but more often than not these stop those cravings and reframe my feelings to something more positive.<br /><br />My husband and I both love these and wouldn't want to be without them. Whoever invented them must be a genius! I've ordered them multiple times through Amazon.com and am extremely satisfied.  My order often arrives within four days or so. What more could I ask for?  I hope you try these if you haven't before.... they really are special.",Lakerol Special Licorice,5

"I am a chai snob. I love chai, but have demanding standards about what I will and won't drink. Most lattes are too sweet and not spicy enough for me. This tea is far and away the most spicy, full of a rich flavors of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom, and yet, it has a very sweet note as well, probably because of the carob. The oolong tea leaves allow you to steep it long enough to get a strongly spiced flavor without the tea tannins going bitter. I don't even blend it into milk or add sugar -- I think a strongly brewed cup is perfect as it is. It's great to travel with if you have a strainer mug or brew it before you go, because even as it cools off it continues to taste spicy yet sweet. I much prefer it to Teavana's other chai blends, and over any other chai I've had really. While pricey, I find 2 oz. lasts about two weeks if you drink one large 12oz tumblr of tea a day, and longer if you're drinking an 8oz mug. The used leaves don't rebrew particularly well and take on a kind of ""metallic"" taste if you boil the leaves to try and improve the weak flavor of the rebrew, but this seems a small criticism of an otherwise excellent and robust tea.",The spiciest chai,5

"The Green Energy Tea Fusion tea powder allows you to make instant ice green tea wherever you happen to be. All it takes is to fill a bottle with a few ounces of cold water and shake. The end product is a green tea that's honey-lemony tasting, low-calorie and, the maker claims, is made of mostly organic ingredients.<br /><br />Each packet has enough powder to make an okay-tasting 8-16 oz. amount of cool green tea. All you need to do is start with a bottle of cold water, take a sip or 2 to make some room for the shaking that's to follow, drop the powder in, then shake the bottle and... here's your cool green tea. It tastes the way you would expect iced green tea to taste when spiked with a little bit of lemon and honey. The taste, when 16 oz. of water are used is comparable to the gallon-size 'green diet ice tea' containers you could buy from some grocery stores only a little more diluted. When used with only 8 oz. it begins to taste like serious tea but than you'd want a second packet. The powder tea packets give you the ability to make instant green ice tea wherever you are and whenever you feel like without having to carry along a gallon-size canister. In addition, the makers claim that the caffeine and the EGCG (100mg) from one packet are sufficient to 'boost' your metabolism if taken three times daily.<br /><br />As far as contents, the main ingredients listed are: organic Japanese green tea extract, organic Yerba Mat&eacute; extract, organic Guava seeds extract, organic Aloe Vera extract, organic honey crystals and some others.<br /><br />The powder has 23 calories but none of them came from saturated fats or trans fats and none of the sweet taste comes from sugar because no sugar was added.<br /><br />I enjoy drinking this when no better options are available - such as the ability to make 'real' brewed green or, better, white tea. I do not see it as a regular substitute to 'real' tea. Since the product does meet my expectations - produce a reasonably decent drink when nothing better can be had, it gets it's 5 stars and my endorsement (for emergencies only) because I can't think of much that could be done to make it better.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />EGCG also known as Epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a powerful anti-oxidant that can be found in green tea but not in black tea.",A good substitute for real tea when the real item is not available,5

"There was always something intriguing about this brand of snack bars, and the unusual name is part of the mystique. Since I have tastes that are off the well-worn track, I finally took the plunge and tried out the dark chocolate fig bars. And I was delightfully surprised. They remind me of the old ""Apple Bakes"" bars that we used to get at one of those ""Big Lots"" kind of stores, which feature clearance products. So you might not get bowled over by this one's fairly humble presentation, since it seems to have minimal hype. But I really appreciate their simple list of ingredients, and here you get 90% fig in each bar! It's a very dense snack - not unlike a brownie. The box they come in is also a nice touch -- very practical and perfect for hiding!! It looks like they are also made in Wisconsin, so I am glad I am keeping my purchase money fairly local. Plus I have a close relative who lives up there! All in all, this bar (and the other tasty nutrition-savvy ones by the brand) is ""the road less traveled"" but definitely packed with satisfaction. I plan to savor this box for a while and use the rest for gifts. Looks like 2012 is going to end in an awesomely Oskri Christmas!!",AMAZING UNEXPECTED FLAVOR COMBO W/ OFFBEAT BRAND NAME,5

The good thing about this salt is 1.) it's not toxic to your body like regular tablesalt, and 2.) it has a much bolder flavor, so you end up using way less than your used to, but still achieving a great flavor in each dish.  I cook meals from scratch every day and i know this salt is going to last me a while, so i believe it's a great deal.",healthy salt??,5

"Okay, I love many Newman's Own products (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTJ6IA"">Newman'S Own Marinara Pasta Sauce With Mushrooms ( 12x24 OZ)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTP1VG"">Newman's Own Ranch, 16-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>) so why not try giving some to my favorite furry friend?  The promises on the package look good - made with organic barley, no wheat, no corn - and the analysis on the back tells me that my West Highland White Terrier will receive 9% minimum of crude protein, 4% minimum of crude fat, 4% maximum of crude fiber.  The ingredients are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic applies, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), and organic molasses.<br /><br />So it sounds good, but how will it be received.  I cannot say that my Westie is a particularly fussy eater (I have yet to meet a terrier who is), but there have been times that he has opted to walk away rather than take a second treat, so I can only assume that after his first bite he was less than interested.  Like any good dog, he can running at the sound of the package rustling, with high hopes that this might be for him.  I pulled out a treat approximately the size of the mousepad on my laptop (or you can look at your keyboard - as wide as your Shift key and as tall as Enter and Shift together).  While my little guy thinks he's a big dog, I know better, so this had to be broken down.  Fortunately, there is a nice perforation down the middle making it easy to break apart for him.  That half would still be a pretty big treat for a smaller dog, but it works nicely for my little guy.<br /><br />I gave him one piece and he took it and waited, hoping I would go ahead and hand him the other so he could take them both away.  After I told him one was all he was going to get, he took his piece out in the yard (he likes to go on the deck to eat his treats).  In just a couple of minutes, he was back and waiting patiently for another.  As soon as I produced the other half, he was up on his back legs and watching that treat intently.  Even now he is watching me since he heard the crinkling as I was getting the information off the bag.  I think my Westie is Newman's Own's newest fan!<br /><br />These are a little pricier than the treats I typically purchase for him, but if you only use these for special treats it should not be too much.  Besides, it makes sense to me to care just as much about what I put into his body as I can about what I put into mine.",My little Westie is begging for more!,5

"I've been looking for this toy forever.  Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive -- good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.<br /><br />The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes ""how can we destroy this previously-entertaining item?""  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)<br /><br />If you crate-train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.  This toy keeps her occupied when she's in her kennel, and rewards her for being in there.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it so far is that the dogs both want to play with it solo -- may have to get a second so they'll both get a turn.",This has Haven-and-Coda Australian Shepherd Approval,5

"I had seen Nutella in the States growing up but didn't really become a heavy user until I lived in Europe for a year. This stuff is amazing - it's super chocolatey with a hint of hazelnut that gives it a really full-bodied, mature flavor. I usually put it on bagels or English muffins as a quick, satisfying dessert. It's also great for baking (Nutella brownies are awesome!)<br /><br />In terms of nutrition, the calories per tablespoon of Nutella is pretty close to the American sandwich staple, peanut butter. Nutella doesn't have quite as much protein as peanut butter but it also doesn't have as much fat or sodium, so there's a trade off.<br /><br />All in all I LOVE this spread and I always have a big jar in my pantry.",Delicious way to turn anything into a dessert,5

"Got this for my kids.  Halfway through his first box my five year old announced it was better than the stuff with the cows on it.  I agree, it is better.  On top of that, the package contains more cartons than than the organic product for less money.  Of course it's from cows not treated with rbST.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Reduced fat milk, sugar, contains 1% or less of each of the following: cocoa (processed with alkali), cocoa, carrageenan, salt, artificial flavor, vitamin A palmitate and vitamin D3.<br /><br />Chocolate milk is the only dairy product that I think tastes good with carrageenan in it.  Most chocolate milks have it.  It's made from seaweed, has been a food product for centuries, and adds a nice creaminess to the drink.<br /><br />In short, great product, great price, and great for the kids (especially when traveling.)",Better and cheaper than the competition,5

"This Green tea blend is SERIOUSLY smooth and delightful.  It is my favorite tea ever.  Ever.<br /><br />The blend of Tulsi and Green tea is a perfect example of something being greater than the sum of its parts.  Plain Tulsi (Holy Basil) tea tastes like grass to me; plain green tea is bitter to my taste (yes, I prepare it properly).... but when you combine the two you wind up with a wonderfully mild, slightly sweet, yet still undoubtedly green concoction that is nothing short of addictive.  I almost can't help but guzzle it.  I got my mom hooked on this tea as well and I have to buy her a bunch from my local Co-op every couple of months and mail it to her!<br /><br />Try this tea.  Then hate me for getting you addicted.  Then stock up if you find it on sale!

"My hair is very prone to dryness. I use to layer 3 different leave in conditioning treatments to keep my hair from drying out between washes. And that only bought me a few days. If I wash my hair too often it starts to shred so I wash it every 7-10 days. So I'm used to about 4 days of good hair and then 4 days of fighting with it until I wash it again.<br /><br />That's not a problem with this conditioner. It leaves my hair really soft (which also makes it easier to straighten) and my hair is shiny and healthy and bouncy until I wash it again. I'm really excited to have found this line. The shampoo that goes along with this is also a great product.<br /><br />Note: I would say this is probably just for really dry hair, though the shampoo can be used on anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp. This conditioner works great for me though. (Dry hair/Dandruff prone.)",Love This Conditioner!,5

This Ghee definitely fits both of those requirements.

With all of this said, this stuff is absolutely delicious. It has a wonderful nutty-butter like flavor and cooks in an excellent fashion. Although I haven't tried other brands of Ghee I can highly recommend this one...I will certainly be buying more, only wish Amazon carried bigger jars.",Absolutely delicious,5

"I bought Avocado Oil specifically for two reasons: one, because it is very similar to olive oil in texture and smell, yet brings a new flavor component to my cooking, and secondly and most importantly for me . . . it has a much higher smoke/burn point than extra virgin olive oil--even higher than Canola oil, grapeseed oil and yes, even safflower oil. I've also read that it's just as healthy. The smoke point of avocado oil is somewhere north of 500F! Roughly 520F in fact. That's amazing, and gives me the versatility I need to quick-fire or sear virtually anything under high heat. La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, one of the few I've tried, tastes great! Fresh and subtly aromatic.<br /><br />Basically, this has been the cure to my burned olive oil blues. That's an especially nice thing, since I have a hyper-sensitive smoke detector and have little room for error when it comes to smoke. To sum it up, though I don't always cook with it (I still use olive oil for low and medium temperature cooking), I love having avocado oil close at hand, for those times when I need it. It actually won't replace your olive oil though, because it has a somewhat different flavor, but it is a flavor I love. Avocado oil is ingenious (and a somewhat new discovery), and La Tourangelle is a trusted producer of the finest of fine edible oils. I trust their brand for some other less well-known oils as well.<br /><br />Highly and enthusiastically recommended--to the point that I'm trying to persuade my family and friends to start cooking with Avocado oil.",A flavorful alternative to extra virgin olive oil for high temperature cooking,5

"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.",My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!,5

"With the start of September I have been craving autumnal flavors, especially pumpkin.  Upon opening the package, pumpkin pie flavoring filled my nose.  It was AMAZING!  It smelled exactly like a spiced pumpkin pie was sitting in my kitchen.<br /><br />I immediately made this into a cold latte based on the delicious smell alone.  Two ounces of warmed water blended with the pumpkin pie matcha, a smidge of sugar and a healthy 6 ounces of icy-cold milk later, I found myself speechless!  After downing the entire cup in record time, I must admit I really want another one!  This is Fall in a cup!<br /><br />In this particular flavor - pumpkin pie - the spices are rich!  Cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg - they all mingle with the pumpkin without overpowering it.  It sort of reminds me of the Starbucks Pumpkin Pie coffee lattes I used to look forward to around this time of year.  I loved them so much I'd try recreating them at home.  Well now, I don't have to!  There's a much healthier version right here without the added sugar.<br /><br />This will not last me very long.",My new Fall beverage staple!,5

"Purchased several of these from various sellers including amazon, never any complaints.  Our baby loves them (55 lb. golden retriever).  She is a very aggressive chewer and the larger ones actually last her about half an hour.  She is always excited when we go to the pantry and she hears one of her many treat bags opening.  She escpecially loves these.  Sometimes if the isn't in the mood to go to town on it, I will let her lick it and that usually gets her juices flowing and she will finish it.<br /><br />She will be age 2 in April and the vet says here teeth look really good.  This has the most mechanical chewing action for an edible product I've seen.  Greenies are nice but they dissappear really quick and can get pricey.  I wouldn't reccomend a steady diet of these however I usually go every other or every third day and supplement with Checkups or Greenies and nylabones.

The designation of home style on the label is misleading though. This sauce could be served in a high end italian restaurant right out of the jar and i kid you not. Their sauces have napa valley wine in the Ingredients. I have not seen any others with wine in their sauces which is the way gourmet sauces are really made. If you can find a better tasting sauce in a jar than there is something wrong with your taste buds or you are buying a sauce loaded with sugar and you like refined sugar. There is only three grams of sugar per serving but you cant tell that because of the natural sweetness of their tomatoes. They also use sea salt which has a lessened effect on blood pressure. This is perfect for those who like sweet sauces but must control sugar intake and want a pasta sauce. In fact this sauce is just plain perfect for anybody period. Though mezzetta sells a pizza sauce you would do just fine with this right here. I pay three dollars a jar when on sale. The grocer sells for six per when not on sale and mezzetta sells for 4.70 per jar or 21.15 per case plus shipping. Shipping will double the price. Buy this with great confidence of the highest quality, standards and taste, you will not be disappointed!",The finest pasta sauce available!,5

"I have tried several different brands of mixers. This is my favorite.

"I bought a pack of this and the Chilean Lime. My wife likes the lime, which are good, but strong tasting. On the other hand, these BBQ chips have a relatively subtle BBQ flavor; nothing like a bag of Lays for instance. The potato taste comes through more than the seasoning. I like them a lot.

Tried quite a few of the k-cup offerings, but wanted to try something different.<br /><br />Nescafe Memento Cappuccino is a very good cool weather choice.  The foamy top layer gives you the feel of a coffee shop beverage, without having to leave the comfort of your home.  Per their description, the premixed packets contain real coffee, milk and sugar, which is what, captured my attention in the first place.  Many of the coffee companies, in an attempt to help the consumer cut calories offer that horrible stevia stuff, which in my opinion leaves a horrible aftertaste and I avoid any products with that or sucralose as an ingredient.<br /><br />Not too sweet, not too bitter, a good combination of flavors and textures for that midafternoon break from the rest of the world.",A Good Combination of Flavors and Textures,5

"There's really not much else to say about this - it's an incredible deal when compared to normal retail prices for saffron.  The saffron is good quality and noticeably fresh (the use-by date on mine was three years away) and it's a fraction of the usual cost.  One thing I particularly liked and that isn't made clear by the description is that this product is actually five one-gram boxes and not one five-gram box, so the saffron in the boxes you haven't opened yet will stay fresh longer.  Still, if you only use saffron every once in a while you'd be better off buying a smaller quantity even if you pay a little more by weight; this is a considerable amount of saffron.  I cook with it regularly so it's great for me, I'm very pleased with this purchase.",Good saffron for an great price,5

"We have been baking these brownies for several years as I have a gluten-free son who is the pickiest of eaters.  If there was a change to the recipe when the company was acquired by Glutino, it did not affect its taste to our family!<br /><br />These are fudgey and chewy not at all dry or cake-like.  We tried freezing them to make them last longer, but they are just as good if not better frozen.  We cut ours after baking and freeze them already cut in a zip-lock bag.<br /><br />A few years ago, an organic living magazine did a taste-test on all brownies and these placed first.  Incidentally, Gluten-Free's chocolate cake mix which used to be called Danielle's decadent cake mix also took first place and it makes the best chocolate cupcakes I have ever eaten!  Try topping them with Pamela's dark chocolate frosting mix. The best!  NO ONE will ever suspect either mix is gluten-free.",Took Top Honors,5

"I decided to contact Dentyne about my favorite gum.  I couldn't figure out why all of a sudden all I could find was Dentyne ICE, which is SUGARLESS!!  I want my Dentyne with sugar in it for heavens sake.  Dentyne answered me saying I should ask my favorite store to carry it, yeah right, like they are going to listen to me.  All they care about is carrying the ""latest and greatest (not)"" junk.  It's ridiculous that I have to order it and pay postage when all stores SHOULD still sell this!  At least they sell Beemans throughout the year (if you're lucky enough to run across it), of course, they want twice the price of any other gum, I suppose that's what they'd do with Dentyne if they sold it.",I thought they quit making it,5

He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food.

"Recently purchase this product in bulk (5 lb bag) for 12 because I was tired of paying almost 3 bucks for a tiny box of pearl/Israeli couscous at the local grocery store. We used the couscous over the weekend in my husband's ground-lamb-and-mint recipe, and it was fantastic.  In his recipe, you cook the couscous and lamb separately, then stir them together before serving. Honestly, I could have eatten the entire pot of couscous without even adding in the lamb component, it was so good! That's saying something, as my husband's recipe is a crowd pleaser. Couscous just needed a little salt, and it was delicous on its own.  I may ask my husband to create this dish again this week...<br /><br />BTW, I stored the remaining couscous in an extra large glass Bormioli Rocco Fido jar with a rubber seal to keep it fresh. It is attractive in the glass jar, and I don't have to worry about keeping the dry couscous fresh.","Excellent product, hermetically sealed for freshness",5

"My husband and I have eaten this excellent brand of Oat Bran every morning for many years. It has a nice, slightly chewy texture rather than being overly powdery--which makes us gag. We prefer to cook it with enough water to make it soupy, pour it into tall glasses, and drink it while we're on the computer or doing our morning reading. We also drink it in the car when we're on the run. We recently moved to another state and had trouble finding it locally.

"I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.",Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality,5

"I haven't had this for so many years I cant even guess how long its been. My self, I've never used this before for cooking so I don't have anything to compare it to. I used it a couple nights ago on some boneless pork country style ribs. I usually do these on the grill and like them because of they're nice thick chunks of meat. I had a package that was going to be grilled so I used them with this instead. Baked them in my Oster Convection Toaster Oven. Used a wire rack inside the broiling pan that came with it and baked them. The coating kept all the juices in the meat! I couldn't believe that there wasn't one single drip from any of them! And I didn't trim the small amount of fat that was on them either. When grilling these they always drip grease and I have to watch that they don't burn when the grease catches on fire. They turned out very nice and juicy and the meat had a nice flavor to it too. It wasn't real spicy and it was like the coating hardly has any seasoning at all in it. Which is nice because next time I use it I can add my favorite seasonings without having a conflict of flavors making them taste weird. And I'm definitely going to be getting some more of this and start using it.",A long forgotten favorite,5
"I reviewed this jerky for my website and really was amazed by the texture. I do eat meat (and jerky) and am not a mock meat fan by any means, but you could seriously slide this jerky by any meat-eater. It had a great texture - nice pull, good chew - but it wasn't the least bit tough as some jerky can be. It is also rich in protein (13g per ounce); a good option for vegetarians and vegans.<br /><br />I waivered on giving it 4 or 5 starts because it isn't a food I would eat regularly since the main ingredients are wheat gluten and soy flour - two foods we try to limit in our household. But since this is my personal ingredient preference and no reflection on the taste and texture of this product (I devoured it in about 2 minutes), I didn't mark it down.<br /><br />Also, the teriyaki flavor is quite savory and a touch salty, not sweet as many teriyaki jerky's tend to be. I think this was a nice change.",Amazing!,5

The taste is good, the feeling is good, and the aftertaste is just like the coffee, not a strange variation of it.<br /><br />I had a little issue with the cappuccino version becuase it had a bit of an emulsified oily feel on the tongue, but this one is good to go.  And at only 50 calories, I would always choose this option.

No muss no fuss!<br /><br />I used to buy this product in the bigger containers from 'warehouse' stores, which I'm sure most of you are aware of which ones I'm talking about.  However, because of the time it took to go through the container and the amount of space it took up in the fridge, I stopped buying them because it would usually start to clump where moisture would get to it.  These containers are just the right size to use without them getting clumpy if you're like us and go through one of these on average every month give or take.  And honestly, we checked pricing at the grocery stores and we couldn't beat the price, either!!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for making this product available to us, we greatly appreciate it!!",Grated Parmesan cheese - Great!,5
"A slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so-called extra bold varieties. The finish is crisp, clean, and ultimately satisfying.  After several cups, one begins to contemplate that there might be an even darker, more fulfilling blend out there somewhere, perhaps being plucked from deep within a jungle or rain forest, or the side of a volcano.  Perchance there is, but until that is discovered, I must continue to let the magic wash across my taste buds, and deal with the sadness that follows the completion of a cup, knowing that the next cup has yet to be poured.<br /><br />Salut.",Magical,5

"After reading reviews I purchased the 2.5 oz. pkgs. of Great Northern Popcorn. It popped up nicely.  Very few ""old maids"". I did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper (the Waring WPM25 model) during the popping process so I pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly. I could see if you left it in the machine, even for a few minutes, that the popcorn could absorb the moisture and lose its crunchy texture.<br />I will definitely buy this product again.",Great results --movie theater popcorn at home!,5

"These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy.",Love Kettle Chips,5

"I was so excited to treat my 3 kitties to ""People Food for Cats"" ~ Petite Cuisine!!  They eat dry food daily and then once in awhile they get the moist food as a special treat.<br /><br />In opening the can, there was not the overwhelming ucky fishy smell that most moist cat foods have.  And it looked like people food too!  I portioned out on one plate 3 equal helpings and called in the calvary!<br /><br />As they licked, the plate rotated on the floor ...ha ha!!... and so did they!!  They followed their portion around like it was the last thing they were ever gonna get to eat!<br /><br />The response ... a resounding purrrrr and then paw-licking/face cleaning!  They loved it!  And that was just the  Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree!!<br /><br />Each day after they got a new flavor, Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, and Steamed Tuna and Shrimp ... responses were all the same! 2 paws straight up from my kitties!!<br /><br />Highly recommended for humans owned by cats everywhere!!<br />- 1smileycat :-)",The Cats Came Running!,5
"This chocolate is divine.  It is rich, does not cause stomach upset and melts like high carb chocolate.<br /><br />I wish amazon carried it at a reasonable price since I am already ordering so much stuff from here, but this chocolate is very over-priced at the time of this review.  You can get 12 bars of any flavor on netrition's website for thirty four dollars instead of the fifty dollars that is currently listed here, they ship anywhere for a flat rate of $4.95 and have a lot of sugar free and low carb items so I am always ordering a lot of stuff and pay just $4.95 shipping, even if the package weighs 20 pounds.<br /><br />Another option is to buy the two poundbags of dark chocolate buttons directly from the low carb specialty website for fourty five dollars with free shipping that includes an ice pack -- per ounce, this is the least expensive way of enjoying Chocoperfection dark chocolate.  The buttons are about an inch across and easier to portion out since a whole bar is too much for me and cannot be divided in half easily; the bars are made up of 5 scored blocks -- so you can have 2 or 3, I wish it was scored evenly.<br /><br />Anyway, I have tried making my own SF chocolate with varied results.  I use the buttons for lots of recipes with no guess work needed.  I often blend it with unsweetened chocolate for really dark chocolate flavor.  What I find really good is to melt 2 ounces ChocoPerfection buttons with 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate and blend with 2-3 ounces organic heavy whipping cream.  Let it set in the fridge and then roll into small balls and dust with unsweetened cocoa, nearly instant truffles with no sugar added!  I use a premium unsweetened chocolate for best results, but any bar found in the baking isle at your grocery store would work.  I don't usually add extra sweetener for the truffle recipe, but I may add a bit of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HBVYP2"">NuNaturals NuStevia No Carb Blend, 1,000 Packets</a> if I need it sweeter -- that stuff rocks also.","This chocolate is awesome, but this vendor is overpriced",5

"What a deal! These instant oatmeal packets are a fraction of the cost of a popular diet company's instant oatmeal, have about 30 less calories and taste great. The packets include extra soy protein and vitamins and are effectively a meal in themselves.While I can clearly taste the maple flavor, we have not experienced the strong smell complained about in at least one other review.

"I used to buy daiquiris and margaritas already mixed in individual freezer bags and enjoyed the convenience very much. For some reason, I cannot find these anymore.  BTW: There are some made by Daily's, but they are made with wine, not liquour (but taste really good anyway!)<br /><br />Still, I was looking for my favorite cocktails in a portable bag. These were very good! They are very fruity (with real strawberry seeds) and creamy..not like kool aid. Also, they freeze really well, no big, sharp shards of ice, but with a squeeze or two, they were more like a slushy.<br /><br />To make: You open the twist cap, fill first with rum (to a premarked line), shake to mix, then fill the rest of the way with water and freeze.<br /><br />I made the first batch just this way, by pouring the liquor right in the bag up to the ""fill line"" on the packaging. I don't know if I had the bag set on the counter incorrectly or what, but the powder seemed to absorb the liquid and I ended up pouring too much rum in the bag and hadn't even reached the line! It didn't even freeze too well as it was too strong (we did drink them anyway!) With the second bag, I measured the rum in a measuring cup (1 1/2 cups...it is written on the bag, too.) They were better. You can vary the amount of liqour to your taste (or even use different kinds of alcohol...or I suppose none at all if you want.)<br /><br />One more fun tip: I mixed the entire bag, then poured individual servings into small ziploc freezer bags. I think I used about 5 or 6 little ziplocs per 1 Lt. Blender Bag (which makes 1/2 gallon.) Then I froze all the little bags. That way we could take only 1 when we wanted it, OR we could throw a few in our beach bags and they stayed slushy for hours. Plus, we didn't have to carry much garbage when we were done (like with cans or bottles.) Also, we didn't have to worry about doling out servings into cups or anything. Just slip a straw into a little opening in the zipper and enjoy!",Great portable cocktails!,5
"My cats love this Duck formula. It has a better solid/liquid ratio than the venison and the lamb. Both of those varieties can be too dry and too solidly pressed for my cats to eat comfortably. To those formulas I usually add some water and mash them up before serving. With the Duck formula - the consistency agrees with them right out of the can. Also, the Duck formula appears to be better mixed at the factory; with other Instinct Grain-Free formulas, I find clumps of white matter - appearing like cottage cheese, however, there is no cottage cheese in them. The Duck formula does not have this problem.",Cats love it!,5

"I wrote a really good review on this item but amazon didn't publish it because it was too long.  So I have to shorten it up.  The tea has three ingredients:  Thai Black Tea, lemon grass, and Pandan leaves.  The Pandan leaves are responsible for the wonderful slightly cream aroma and taste that comes through the tea flavor.  Thai black tea is attributed to having anti-cancer benefits as well as the lemongrass.  Both score high on the anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer list.  I have been feeling so much better and so energetic with this tea (and this brand by the way), that I highly recommend it.  I researched it and it probably has only 40-50 mgs. of caffeine per serving - but don't let that stop you.  There are no side effects for me, no headaches, no shakes, no indigestion, or acid reflux like I used to get with even the best coffees and american black teas.  This tea is awesome and as other reviewers have stated, it is the best!  It comes in a one lb. bag and it seems to last for over a month for one bag even if I use it every day or sometimes more than once a day!  Lots of stuff in that bag!<br /><br />I drink it without the cream and sometimes put soy milk in it but always I drink the tea with a little sugar and/or agave nectar.  I boil the tea for five minutes as instructed and then I put it through a french press.  I make one big rounded table spoon of tea and put it in the press and I can get two and a half very large cups of the tea, made strong and dark like the restaurants.  Sweetened to taste, it is amazing.  I'm energetic all day long and never get insomnia or tired.<br /><br />Good luck!  I got my item in just a few short days and the seller did a great job shipping it out.",Excellent - and MORE than just a tea!,5

"This is absolutely the best popcorn flavoring I have ever had. It tastes like the best movie theater popcorn you've ever had. And since you just made it, it's fresh and tastes absolutely phenomenal. I've made several batches so far. My 4 year old loves it, my teenager loves it, and I think I loved it the most.  A definite must try. I followed the directions exactly. My popcorn machine doesn't recommend using anything but olive oil, but I think I'm going to test out the coconut oil and see. If it was as good as it was and I left out that signature ingredient, I can't wait for the next batch!","wonderful, movie theater seasoning",5

"I am a huge tea fan. I drink hot tea more than I drink cold water throughout the day. So, it is easy to say that I am very picky when it comes to my tea. I have tried tons of different flavors and tons of different brands. My friend recommended Mighty Leaf and I decided to give it a try. The second that the three-minute brew time was up, I immediately smelled one of the greatest scents I have experienced. The jasmine is not too strong and not too weak. While drinking the first cup that I made for myself, it actually made me feel very relaxed. There is a perfect ratio of herbs to 1 tea-bag. I am very glad that my friend gave me the recommendation and hope to buy a case of other flavors to try.",Wonderful Flavor,5

"Before joining the military back about about a bazillion years ago, I wasn't a coffee drinker.  Never cared for the stuff.  As fate would have it, my first duty station was in Germany, and required many long shifts at odd hours.  I begrudgingly began to drink the stuff (and surly everyone has heard about military coffee, all of it is true). By accident I happened across Jacobs coffee, and began to drink the stuff for pure enjoyment.  Drank it by the pot, I did, loved the stuff...<br />And then I rotated back to the states.  This was before the days of the luxury of the internet, and my beloved coffee was not to be found...  After 911, I went overseas again, and managed to bring back some Arabic coffee, but it was a poor substitute.  And then I found amazon.com.  Love this site, and the things I can find on it.  I'm reviewing this purchase not for the coffee (which, by now, I think I've gotten the point across that I love to death), but rather the grate deal I got on it.","Best Da*n Coffee, Period",5

The number one critic is my dog and she loves these.  They kind of look like thick sugar cookie biscuits and have a slight perforation line so you can break one long one into two smaller 'cookies'; which is what I do for my dog.  She seems to enjoy biting down on these since they are pretty firm and dense and she chews up every last bit of them.  I've seen no allergies or problems from her after having them and I'll get some more as a special treat for her in the future.,My dog loves these,5

"I buy this product nearly everyday on my local college campus for about 2 dollars per 16 oz bottle. This is one of the most delicious and enriching-energizing drinks I have had. Much better than coffee, 5-hour energy, and any other energy drink you can buy at a local quick-mart. I would highly recommend this product to anyone I meet, but I would not recommend they purchase it here. The price here is more than double that of a local supermarket or health-foods store, not to mention you won't be receiving them cold.<br /><br />Overall this product deserves a 5-star rating for taste and energy-fulfillment, however, the Amazon price far outreaches the benefits of the product.

"This dulse is fantastic, sundried deliciousness! My household goes through at least 24 of these biodegradable pouches a year on account of my tsunami popcorn (airpopped corn, dulse, nutritional yeast, occasionally rice crackers -- Hawaiian style) habit; don't forget salt & vinegar dip. We used to buy them from a health food supermarket, but you can't beat the quantity here. I think the price is about the same.<br /><br />Also try this dulse (or the less savory flakes) in vegan baked beans, black eyed peas, adzukis, etc. Great substitute for bacon in beans, soups, or salads. Really wonderful stuff, though it may take getting used to. I've always been a sucker for a good seaweed salad! Will stink up cabinets or anywhere else that you store these bags and flavor other items over time, so store carefully (it can also get really dry if left (or forgotten) for months).",Delicious Dulse!,5

"I've had a lot of different kinds of cococnut water and this is by far the most palatable flavor for me. It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands. This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut. There's also no aftertaste, it goes down clean. Excellent beverage for rehydrating, especially when you let it get real cold. This is better for you than drinking gatorade. I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising. Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth!",My favorite flavor...,5

"I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel ""mouth-satisfied"" as well.

The smell of the powder is beautiful and gives you an impression it will contribute wonderful flavors.<br /><br />I used this on a recipe that included 6 ounces of high quality chocolate from El Rey. The chocolate came out tasting chocolatey, a little bitter from the chocolate itself, and slightly sweet. Overall I was happy with the chocolate flavor in that it was extremely dominant. I prefer to get a true chocolate taste rather than a super sweet chocolate taste. So if your looking for dominant chocolate tones buy this chocolate!",Great Chocolate Flavor,5

"I love the happy baby and similar brands of organic baby food in pouches, but they have one MAJOR downfall in my eyes- most of the blends are SUPER SWEET. It's difficult to find many pouches with just vegetables, and no super sweet fruits mixed in. I hate the idea of teaching my child that everything MUST taste sweet (spinach, broccoli, peas, etc- they're always mixed with mango, pear, apple, etc- they always just taste like fruit.) I LOVE that he Amaranth Ratatouilli is not sweet at all- it actually tastes like vegetables!! My child loves it. We frequently mix it into other things- pasta, rice, etc. It's great topped with cheese. One bit of warning though- this blend seems pretty acidic, so babies with sensative tummies might have trouble- I would just mix it in smaller portions with pasta or something else.","yay!

"This is a great product for those who need gluten, dairy & casein free foods. We use both these individual packets and the boxes with the GF noodles - both are handy and great.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez - do you really think you can get fake cheese or non-cheese to taste like the real thing?!? If you're looking for something to replicate real cheese or annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non-cheese products.<br /><br />However, if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix and the other roads end products. It has a unique flavorful taste. We tend to alternate this stuff <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXG8W"">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> The Road's end is closer to cheese than the Namaste but again, those who want a real cheese flavor/consistency will be sorely disappointed. However, for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great.<br /><br />We mix in veggies with ours (you know the ones that are little squares of carrots, peas, corn, etc.) and I use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor. Also if you add a bit of trocomare <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBSO"">A. Vogel Trocomare, 3.2 Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a> it makes a huge difference in flavor (actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything! We love it and use it on just about everything.<br /><br />So - for those who expect a real cheese flavor - don't even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations.<br /><br />For those who realize it won't taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique (and gluten, dairy, casein free) - buy this, it's great!!!",Great alternative for gluten dairy & casein free,5

"The matcha green tea powder had a great color too it. The packaging was in a large, sealed reflective foil bag with a label showing the manufacture's nutrition information. (Note: The bag was not resealable, so make sure you have a container to store it in after opening.)<br /><br />The tea itself was a nice green color, very close to what is pictured in the description. I did not find it having a brownish tint at all, unlike some of the reviews that I have seen on here. It was all green. I could not find a better price for 8 oz. of matcha tea powder.<br /><br />I personally started drinking matcha tea recently so I cannot determine how much better or worse it is compared to other brands. I do, however, have to say that I love the taste of this tea. I drink it unsweetened as both hot and iced tea. I also have successfully replicated great smoothie recipes and  an iced latte recipe from my favorite beverage establishments (this stuff has saved me so much $$$ in smoothies that it has already paid for itself.)<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.

"Stretchable Nylon fabric is of very good quality, after stretching it while wearing I never had the fear of nearly tearing it unintentionally as the material quality was reliable. Free size can be stretched as needed.I usually wear half sleeve t-shirt, and I get skin tan beyond sleeves upto the wrist/fingers mainly because of bike riding. So I needed such a thing to protect my hands.I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want cotton fabric but nylon or lycra. Go for it!Good Packaging, Free...",Excellent,5
I read up on Chia seeds and their great properties.  I had to buy some and purchased this 2 pack.  The item was nicely packed and the product is definitely A grade.  The seeds are EXTREMELY FRESH and have an expiration date for about 10 months.  I'm using it daily with a few bottles of water and feel great taking it.  There is barely a taste and the gelled up seeds are extremely palatable.  I would recommend anyone who wants to add Chia to their diet to really consider this brand because it's a premium product.,Superb premium product,5

"This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, ""Go find"".  They love it, and will throw the ""stump"" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that ""Go find"" spreads around.  You may want to confine the play to a room that is easily mopped.",Cattledogs love it!,5

"This starter makes delicious yogurt. I like to use it with whole milk. You must first heat the milk up to at least 180 degrees and then cool it to 73-77 degrees. As the previous reviewer stated, you must use an icewater bath to cool the milk down. This works wonderfully. I let my yogurt incubate 15 hours and it is extremely thick and delicious! It has a bit of a tart taste, which is very yummy. I alternate using this yogurt with the Yogourmet freeze-dried yogurt for variety. I eat yogurt every single day and have been using Yogourmet starters for a couple of years now. I won't use any other brand as I've tried several and the ones from Yogourmet are the best.",Delicious yogurt!,5

"After reading a lot of reviews on puppy food, I settled on Nature's Variety Prairie puppy food.  It has high quality ingredients, no by-products, and lots of vitamins and minerals for my little guy to develop into a healthy adult.  The food has made my dog's coat super lustrous; he's an almost 5 month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi.  Since switching to this brand (we were using Authority puppy food before), his coat has become super shiny and soft.  He loves the taste and it makes his poops relatively small and hard.  If switching to this brand, be sure to switch slowly by integrating larger and larger amounts of this food while decreasing amounts of the original food.  I highly recommend this product, and the price is cheaper on Amazon than at Petco!","Awesome, high quality food",5

"A good friend sent me an email a year ago regarding the health benefits of Green Giant Asparagus Spears (health-full all by itself, and contains no pesticides or preservatives).  Having a number of health challenges, including fibromyalgia, I decided to give the asparagus regimen a try -- and am I ever glad I did!  It has helped in so many ways, and if I happen to forget and miss a day, I can tell right away the next day in the amount and location of increased pain.  I put the whole can in a blender, plus a tablespoon of minced garlic for added flavor, and puree.  With four tablespoons taken twice daily, the benefits are noticeable within a few days. When you sign up for the subscription service with Amazon, this product is delivered to your door for free, and at the best price I've been able to find anywhere.<br />I highly recommend this regimen as a dietary supplement. As I am not a doctor, I have included an excerpt from someone who is:  As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer.  Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory, asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance.<br /><br />The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good...  It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body's most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants.",Many uses for this healthy body tonic,5

"This cola is really good! Yep, I gave it five stars!<br /><br />There's really only one thing to consider here, and that is cost. I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />So why do I think the reviews are all over the place? For one, everyone has different tastes. If we gave ""real"" Coke or Pepsi to 10 people, you will get many people who hate it. I like Pepsi Throwback myself, but to each his own. So yes, some people will hate this syrup. I'm not going to disagree with someone else's taste buds!<br /><br />But let me try to help those who have tried this and thought it wasn't very good. I can relate. Because that's what I thought at first too! Why? The answer is simple. The recipe on the bottle is really not very good.<br /><br />The recipe calls for 1 cap full of syrup and 6 ""buzzes"" of carbonation. I highly recommend you try 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cap fulls of syrup to 6 buzzes or even 7 buzzes. I like 7, but 6 was okay as well. Coke and Pepsi are VERY sweet. I thought about this, and added the extra syrup. The difference is like night and day. The additional syrup makes this taste much better to me, and much closer to what Coke tastes like.<br /><br />Now, one selling point Sodastream tries to make is cost. ""25 cents per 2 liter!"". Well this syrup, with the Natural Can Sugar, is twice the cost at major retailers of the standard Cola (the one that has Sucralose and Sugar). When you add in the extra syrup with my recommended recipe, you really aren't getting that much soda. I think I can get 6 liters of soda out of this with the new recipe. For $10 cost on the syrup alone, that's some expensive soda!<br /><br />But really, Sodastream for us is not about saving money. It's about kids and family having fun making their own soda. The novelty might wear off, sure, but we have given up worrying about the saving money part and are just enjoying the unit for the fun of creating our own sodas.<br /><br />PROS: Tastes great. Made only with natural sugars.<br /><br />CONS: Recipe needs to be altered to taste. If you use more syrup like I do, you aren't saving money versus buying Coke or Pepsi.<br /><br />Bottom line: this syrup tastes good if you alter the recipe and make your soda sweeter than called for on the bottle. If you aren't concerned with saving money on your soda and just with having fun with your creations, this is still a good buy.",It can taste really good!! But you need the right recipe!!,5

Byron's, however is the real deal: since buying this stuff, I have used it on ribs, pork butt roast, steaks and turkey. It produces consistantly great results on grilled food, low & slow barbeque and even on oven roasted meats. It adds a nice zip to soups, salads and veggies too. I will be seasoning the Thanksgiving turkey with it at the request of my SO.<br /><br />I concur with the reviewer who urged potential customers to get the big size: it gets used up real fast!!",An Excellent Multi Purpose Seasoning!,5

"I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try.  We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content.  Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant.  You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball.  It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog.  We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing.  It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it.  The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left.  We will definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat.  Highly recommended!",Fantastic Product,5

"These cups are a perfect size for a snack or lunch. It tastes exactly like the canned ravioli, which is either good or bad depending on your taste. I love that the container is not heat conductive (it is similar to stryrofoam), so it is easy to pick up and handle even when it is very hot, though you'll need to watch out for the metal ring on the lip. I wouldn't want kids heating these up on their own since they are very full and I could easily see an accident happening pulling it out of the microwave and taking the lid off.<br /><br />I keep these at work in a desk drawer for those days when i just don't have time for anything else. It is true comfort food for those of us who loved it as a kid! It would be great for a dorm room.<br /><br />The cups seem very waterproof and durable, and if worse comes to worst you could eat it without even heating, so we keep a half-dozen in our hurricane supply box.",as good as you'd hope,5

"It's classic Chef Boyardee ravioli, just stuffed with a very decent mild sausage instead of the beef we're all used to.  It also has chunks of the same sausage, exactly like boxed pizza toppings, mixed in with the sauce.  All in all, it's a great quickie lunch as is or a very decent dinner when prepared with the right sides.  A trick I learned as a youth when eating the classic ravioli for lunch most days, mix in a single slice of good quality American or Swiss sandwich cheese and carefully stir it into the sauce as it melts.  It adds another level of creaminess to the sauce and it makes it ""done"".  Serve it with some crusty bread.","A classic, updated a bit.",5

"Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(","Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea",5

"Currently I'm on my second jar of this fantastic rice, it completely seduced me with its nutty and totally buttery aroma - raw in the jar it smells just like that, but the taste is equally impressive.<br />My favorite way of making it starts with saut&eacute;ing two shallots or some onion with a bit of olive oil or butter, then to that I add whatever herbs I have around, usually rosemary or thyme, then I add the uncooked rice and dry saut&eacute; it until lightly toasted, at the end I throw in a handful of golden raisins and two cups of chicken broth, 20 minutes on a slow simmer and a tasty side is ready.<br /><br />I have burned my share of rice in the past or was forced to throw out the overly wet batches, but this one comes out perfect every time. Whether I make it plain or fancy it up, it always tastes delicious.<br /><br />This brand of rice is great at creating wonderful hybrids for all kinds of dishes, highly recommended.<br /><br />- Kasia S.",Delish!,5

I have been using store bought yogurt to make my yogurt. However I have found that Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt is so much better than the store bought variety. The flavor is purely delightful. I like to eat it as soon as it is cooled off. My yogurt is now much thicker and tastier than it was with the store bought yogurt. There is another benefit. I have been trying to regulate my digestive system......have had a problem for years. I have taken probiotic supplements with absolutely no success. My system now is perfect.....thanks to the Probiotic Yogurt Starter.,Yummy Yogurt,5

"I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!",Convenience at low cost,5
"First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it.

I use 1/8 tsp. plus 1/64 tsp. (the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MOYI5W"">Amco Measuring Spoons for Small Amounts</a> are great for this purpose) to sweeten a gallon of tea, and it's as sweet as a heaping cup of granular splenda (or sugar).

"And it's a good surprise!  I was cautious, expecting either something with no resemblance to meat, or something so rubbery as to be inedible.  Sure, the texture is not EXACTLY like real jerky, it's a bit liquidy for that.  But for a vegan product, outstanding!  It's chewy without being rubbery, far juicier than real jerky(which is a good thing), and tastes spot on.  Granted, the Texas BBQ doesn't taste the way I'd thought it would(I was expecting a tomato-y BBQ sauce flavor), but it's very good, with just the right amount of smoke.

"This Six Pack of prepared spices for making chicken curry is another in the recent increase in products making ethnic cuisine easier to make.  Usually the added convenience is at the expense of flavor, e.g.-microwaveable frozen chicken curry.  When trying to get authentic flavor without spending an inordinate amount of time, there are many products (e.g., Shan) which give you packs of prepared spice mix.  However, most of these require the addition of other spices (i.e., garlic and ginger paste) making the cooking process more time consuming.<br /><br />Kitchen's of India Curry Paste gives you all the spices that one needs to make chicken curry that tastes just like mom's.  In fact, mom ordered a package! Total time from addition of chicken and water is about 40 minutes and the results are great.  Each package gives you enough for a meal for two.<br /><br />Only drawback is that you can't reduce the ""chili hotness"" without reducing flavor of other spices; however, this curry paste is milder than most similar products.  If anything, you may want to add some chili pepper to taste.<br /><br />Overall a great product for quickly and relatively inexpensively making authentic Indian chicken curry.",Easy to prepare and delicious,5

He absolutely loves it, and I recommend it to anyone.  I bought mine before they 'upgraded' to a rubber rope part, but he has only gotten the knot open once so it's not a problem.  It dispenses food quickly enough to keep him interested, and even once he's done eating he still likes to chew on the rubber and rope a little.

"I've developed a love of anything with pumpkin spice in it over the past couple of years, so when I saw this tea I had to try it.  First of all, I'm a fan of Bigelow teas.  They're always full of flavor and the individual foil packages keep the tea fresh for a very long time.  This tea has become one of my favorites.  It has a great pumpkin spice flavor and I found it's the best with a little milk and sugar.  It's good without adding anything, but adding milk and sugar (or whatever sweetener you may use) makes it taste almost like pumpkin pie.<br /><br />Many pumpkin-flavored beverages out there fall flat when it comes to the pumpkin spice flavor, but this tea nailed it.  I'm glad it comes in a pack of 6 boxes because I'm sure it's going to be hard to find once winter is over.",Love it!,5

When I developed a lipoma on my calf, I figured my lymphatic system was congested. I bought a liver detox kit and used it for a few weeks, but I didn't really notice any results.<br /><br />Then I found websites talking about essiac tea. I had never heard of it, but people were making some pretty remarkable claims about it. As per usual, I immediately came to amazon to see what people here had to say about it (I feel confident that the reviews here are authentic). When I typed in ""essiac tea"" in the search module, it brought up Flor Essence. This product had terrific reviews, and I'd read how great it is for detoxing; so I figured, what have I got to lose?<br /><br />People claim that it has cured their cancer. I can't make a comment on that, because as far as I know, I've got no cancer. But after taking this tea for a few days, I can definitely state that it seems quite potent medicinally. I've been taking 2 oz. of the brewed tea with 2 oz. hot water, 3 times a day. The third day I started feeling the typical flu-like symptoms of detox, and by day 4 I woke up feeling like a truck had hit me. My allergies and chemical sensitivities got really bad. I had a lot of sinus congestion. I could feel this stuff working. It's been a little over a week now, and it's still working great. I think the worst of the detox is over. I also started taking milk thistle and quercetin with vitamin C, and I think those supplements are assisting in the detox.<br /><br />Also, my boyfriend who never really thought he had digestive tract issues started taking this tea, just to maintain his health. Within a few days, he started seeing some nasty stuff (i.e. Candida, etc) come out in his bowel movements. So I guess this tea is also terrific for actually killing any parasites one may have. I can't say that it will do so for everyone, but he and I are both having success with the tea. We even recommended it to his parents to try and are telling our friends about it. It's not difficult to brew at all. After reading reviews where people said it was hard to do, I expected it to be grueling. It really doesn't take that long to prepare. Most of the time is spent allowing the tea to brew overnight. When I make the tea, I'd say it takes me about 30 minutes in the evening and about 10 minutes the following morning.<br /><br />If you're looking to detox, give this a go. Don't increase the dosage beyond the recommended amount (as I'm apt to do, because I always want to speed things up!), because if you do, you'll feel awful. But this day in age, I think it's all vital that we complete a detox every few months or so. Our bodies simply have yet to catch up with the toxin overload created by the modern world. I've tried a few detox remedies, and this one, by far, is my favorite. I intend to use this tea for a very long time, if not for life.",Terrific for Detox!,5

"My cat had the worst food allergies. The way she dealt with it was by vomiting on an almost daily basis. Getting special foods (i.e. Science Diet or Purina from the veterinarian) didn't help at all. Finally I tried Newman's Own dry food figuring it couldn't be any worse. It worked like a miracle! No more allergies and no more carpet cleaning except the occasional hairball. When my cat got older I started supplementing her dry food with the Newman's Own wet food and she loves it. She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce. That's definitely something I want when I'm feeding my cat.<br /><br />The price through Amazon.com is cheaper than buying in the stores and the cans come well packaged and undamaged. I won't be going to the store for this again. Thanks Amazon!","Great food, Great price, and no more food allergies!!!",5

"I got this to use in tea that I preferred to use honey in(Jasmine tea). And I gave up using honey,(being a product made by bees,and it really belongs to the bees),when I became vegan.<br /><br />I also found it,with Stevia,or xylitol(a sugar substitute that isn't like sugar,having only 5 molecules of(something),so it does not affect you body or teeth like sugar does. Stevia is a sugar-like,low calorie sugar replacement,being like sugar in that it has 6 molecules(of whatever it is that makes your body respond to it like it is sugar). But I made a good vegan chocolate syrup,that would not have been good without a modest squirt of agave nectar.<br /><br />I only used filtered water,some cocoa powder(about a quarter cup),I teaspoon(a regular teaspoon,not a measuring teaspoon) of instant coffee(I like Maxwell house and hershey's cocoa,the special dark or the regular cocoa works)...for most of the sweet taste,I used Stevia,enough to make it sweet. I don't know how much. But it had an ""off""taste,and wasn't that great. I added a short squirt of agave nectar,a tablespoon,maybe a little more.but not much,and it""fixed it"",and the ""off""taste went away. I had it on unsweetened,partly thawed frozen strawberries. Chocolate fans I'm sure will find many uses for a basic,not high calorie,tasty chocolate syrup. With soymilk I'm sure it would make a good,vegan,chocolate milk,or hot chocolate. Or a vegan hot cocoa. Added to tofu and soymilk in a blender,vegan chocolate pudding.

I find this Peach Green Tea to be the BEST and I do not tire of drinking it everyday...usually 4-6 cups daily. Some green tea is overly bitter and trying to drink it everyday gets to be a chore rather than a pleasure. But not this Bigelow tea. There is a perfect balance of the tea and peach flavor and it is easier on the stomach because the green tea flavor is fresh and delicate rather than astringent and overbearing. Bigelow has good quality control because every cup is equally yummy and there are no grassy or fishy flavors some other manufacturers' teas have. You can be confident that this is high quality tea and very enjoyable. Drink it by the case as I do...it tastes great and it is good for you to boot!,The BEST! Absolutely Delicious!,5

"I try to drink 1-3 cups of green tea everyday and this was a great way to try out so many different Stash green teas at once.<br /><br />The varieties included were (ordered May 2010):<br /><br />Chai Green - Very good chai, one of my favorites. Better than Celestial<br />Fusion Breakfast - Too much going on- mix of Indian Assam, Indonesian Black, Chinese Green, Japanese Green, African Black, and Japanese Matcha<br />Fusion Green & White - Good if you can't decide to have white tea or green tea, which happens every so often to me<br />Ginger Peach - not my cuppa, too much ginger and difficult to find the peach flavor<br />Organic Premium Green - very good<br />Moroccan Mint - Excellent, not quite as minty as peppermint herbal tea, but a nice balance of mint and green flavors<br />Pomegranate Raspberry - meh, okay when you're craving fruity but I wouldn't invest in a case of this<br />Premium Green - very good<br />Decaf Premium Green - Excellent, my kids drink this often<br /><br />After drinking tea for years with or without sweetener (no milk) I made a mistake one morning and put <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC"">Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup</a> into my tea with some cream (thinking it was coffee!) and I was blown away with the smooth, mellow taste. I now drink my tea with a little vanilla syrup and cream (less than I would use in coffee) and it's such an amazing flavor - like dessert. My daughter thinks it tastes like Yoplait vanilla yogurt.

"I just adore these snacks!  I've only tried white cheddar so far but am coming back to try another flavor.  I bought them when doing Atkins, at just 1 carb per serving, yet crunchy and tasty, it was quite a nutritional bargain!  Now I've switched to Weight Watchers and these yummy little gems are only 2 points plus per pack.  There may be an acquired-taste period for the first pack, but it passes quickly. I can not say enough about Just the Cheese; whenever I get a craving to reach for high fat, high carb snacks (chips, buttered popcorn, whatever), I reach for these and I am satisfied without breaking the budget.  Love them.","Crunchy, cheesy, salty, deliciousness",5
This is a cheap price to score some points.  It comes in a box that you get to unwrap and untie the bow. This chocolate is the best ever and after tasting and finishing off the entire box we couldn't wait to get another. That will have to wait though for the price but it was worth what we paid. Do yourself a favor and pay the price just to try it out. I really didn't know much about this type of chocolate and took a chance and got a box. This was a Christmas present for my wife but after all the good stuff we read we had to break into it a month early. I thought to myself how much differently could this really taste than the American chocolate I am used to.,This will keep your mother in law happy,5

"This chutney is so nice that when I noticed there were no reviews, I had to add one. We take this product all over the world with us, serve it at receptions and at the most formal of dinners. People think it is homemade. Chili-Lime is our family favorite, and is often specifically requested by return dinner guests - regardless of what we are serving. It is zesty, with well-balanced spicing and the taste is fresh. All the Geeta brands we have tried - we have tried many - are excellent quality.

"I've never been a fan of kiwi & strawberry together, but I think Switch got it right by combining fruit juice with carbonation.  I am a big fan!  It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it - which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.  Try this - I don't think you'll regret it.",A delightful combination,5

I will be ordering more products from this company as their coffee rocks the house.

"Green Mountain's Dark Magic Extra Bold is my go-to coffee for use with my Keurig coffee machine. I go through more of this particular flavor then any other type of coffee. In fact I don't think a day goes by that I don't have at least 1 cup of this flavor, if not more. Don't let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow. Its not overly acidic, it does't taste burnt, its just a good cup of ""coffee flavored coffee"". It works well with most flavored creamers, sweeteners, but is a pleasant cup in its pure and unadorned form as well.",Dark Magic is my kind of Magic,5

"I had seen these brownies on GMA and they supposedly were voted ""America's best brownie"".  I had been so excited to try a very famous brownie from a company in Chelsea Market when we were in NY a couple years ago and was horribly disappointed so I was a bit gun shy to try another media hyped brownie, but curiosity got the better of me.  These are indeed very delicious...moist and full of flavor.  I've only tasted the chocolate chunk, but the box came with caramel pecan and peanut butter as well.  I gave these 5 stars based on the chocolate chunk.  However, since they all have the same chocolate base I expect the other two will be just as yummy.  No disappointment here - - these are terrific!",Delicious!,5

"This is an excellent tasting tea.  The tea when set draws rapidly as compared to other teas and is strong in consistency.

"I just bought my first box of this, being a sort of STASH CHAI addict, drinking the BLACK CHIA TEA, and the GREEN CHIA TEA, both of which are good. So, you like CHAI? great. The box lists the same spices for each box, but they are in different ratios, depending on the strenght of the backround tea. The black tea, uses ginger, then cinnamon, clove, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamon, in decreasing amounts of spice, as you decend down the spice list. (altho the company also uses spice oils, for the teas, for more flavor.) The green tea CHIA as more cinnamon in it, compaired to the black chia. NOW, for the WHITE CHIA. SPICES AS  FOLLOWS, its mostly CINNAMON, then ginger, allspice, clove, nutmeg, and cardamon. ALL real CHIA teas, use these spices, but they need to be balanced to the teas, and WHITE TEA, is very delicate tea, of course. ALso, since it is even less processed than GREEN TEA, its very easy to make it bitter.  (It has more antioxidants than green tea too.) SO, if you get this, and you want it to taste good, dont throw BOILING WATER on the tea bag(s). Let your water sit for a minute, until its around 190 degrees F. THEN, add your tea bags, and dont let it brew for more than FOUR MINUTES. THEN, like ALL CHIA TEA, it must be VERY sweet, for the spices to ""work"". I add asparteme, and LOTS of it ,and a bit of honey, and some SOY MILK....ALL DONE!!! Stash's chia tea is the best, the VERY BEST. I tasted them all. There's no black pepper, chicory, or other wierdness.  SO, even tho with white chia you only get 18 bags of tea per box, instead of 20 with the GREEN or BLACK CHIA, its worth the few extra pennies for this tea. BUT, first, do you like WHITE TEA, and DO YOU LIKE SPICES? (and if you dont like to sweeten your tea, or add milk/soy, just stay away from CHIA. ) PS. dont make this the old TIBETIAN way, cos you dont want to BOIL white tea.","Very smooth delicate flavor, great CHAI TEA",5

"I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or ""burnt"" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time.",Coffee house flavor for about 40 cents a cup,5
"Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word ""mati"" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served. On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea. Knowing its manifold health benefits -- among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals -- the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land. In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well. In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.",Magic Potion from South America.,5

Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one-eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.<br />I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non-fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their orange zest is great also!",Got lemons .... make toothpaste?,5

"I do not have finicky cats, but I liked the thought of getting them extra scrumptious food. It might as well be tuna to them, they go crazy over it- even compared to Blue Buffalo's other flavors and other premium pet foods. The ingredients are comparable with more expensive pet foods. It still seems a little pricey at first, but my cats seem satisfied with the small portions recommended on the bag. Small portions = less litter waste too. The LifeSource Bits were a major selling point for me, but I wish the information on them was less ambiguous. The only thing I did not like was that my cats didn't seem to feel the need to chew the tiny kibbles very often.",Excellent pet food,5
"What do fruit, brownies, and meat have in common? Yep the answer is they all go amazingly well with this chile lime seasoning. Sprinkling this stuff on top of wip cream is also a surprizing treat. Its great in a brownie batter, and is a wonderfull marinade for grillables. Its also perfect if you need to add a tart zing to a dish without adding any liquid. Toss french fries, chips, or any other fried foods immediately in this seasoning, after it comes out of the oil. It adds the acid that fried foods so desperately need, while still keeping them crispy. Who wants to mush up the batter with lime juice, well I use to, but not anymore?<br /><br />This seasoning will make you explore the boundaries of savory and sweet combinations (since it labeled itself a fruit seasoning), some will be delightful and others will be horrible failures. However, the experiences you will gain and the palette lessons you will learn from this magical seasoning are priceless.I liked the 8 pack because I saved on shipping with the amazon prime discount and also got to hand out 6 of them as gifts/party favors.","Fruit, brownies, and meat?",5

"My daughter was on Nutramigen for her entire first year but not by my choice.  She, unfortunately, was a victim of quacks and landed in the NICU for the first month of her life. Her NICU stay wasn't much better because of some lazy nurses (and I can judge because I am a nurse myself) They were feeding her regular Enfamil at first but switched her to Nutramigen because of stomach ""issues"" (the issue was they were stuffing her with about a cup of formula per feed 6-8 times a day!) They actually distended her stomach! When she got home she could not tolerate any other formulas so I just stuck with Nutramigen. (Sorry, just had to vent!)<br />Anyway, I started out using the powder which was OK but I always had a problem with clumping and clogging the nipple which would then cause my daughter to scream at the bottle.  Aside from the inconvenience, it was only good for 24 hours.  Plus, in my research, I found out that almost all baby tragedies regarding any formula had to do with powders not liquids.  Yes, buying the liquid is more costly, but Nutramigen is expensive anyway so what's a few more bucks especially when child safety is concerned.  It was roughly an extra 2 bucks a day.<br />The liquids are pasteurized and good for 48 hours which is a big timesaver.  I have used the 13oz concentrate liquid, 32oz RTU can, 2oz plastic nursettes, the 6oz glass nursettes (LOVED those) and the 8oz concentrate in plastic bottles(more on those later...Boo!).<br /><br />When Enfamil came out with these 8oz RTU bottles, I immediately bought them.  The individual bottles are convenient and don't take up much room.  They are all foil sealed, cap-locked and boxed to protect from light.  They have a fairly long shelf life so you can stock up (NB: if you order directly from Enfamil, as I did, the expiration was always 3-6months from the purchase date. I can not speak for other vendors.) When you do open them, you never have to worry about waste because of the small size.  In the rare event that you do waste it's only a few ounces not an entire can.  The 6 pack case was also helpful when I needed to leave some at grandma's house.<br /><br />Incidentally, a caution regarding the 8oz concentrate bottles.  I purchased the concentrate bottles at the same time as the RTU, however I noticed that the concentrate formula had these gray-black floaters in it which I never saw in other liquid versions of Nutramigen.  Even after shaking well they still remained. I immediately called Enfamil to express my concern and they sent me a new case. This case had the same problem so, out of curiosity, I mixed it up and tried it.  Although, it tasted and smelled like Nutramigen (which is God awful BTW, akin to asparagus and metal bathed in dirty feet) I was still concerned and did not give to my daughter. I asked them to replace the order with glass nursettes.  In retrospect, my suspicion is that the floaters are iron particles that do not disperse well in the fat(like oil and vinegar) and thus are harmless, however I would still be wary.  It is possible that Enfamil has addressed this issue since my purchase several months ago but I would stick to the ready to use formulas or 13oz concentrate cans.",LOVE the Convenience (but not the cost!),5

"My Sir Reginald (Reggie) is 13.5 yrs old and a one year cancer survivor.  He is 1/2 Pek and 1/2 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  He is very particular about his food and only likes, and deserves, the best and healthiest, plus his vet has him on a special prescribed food regiment.  But this product, is tasty and healthy for him.  We have a routine every night when we go to bed; he gets 4 of these poppers and 4 of the chicken and carrot treats, then a massage, then sleep.  I searched everywhere for these treats and finally found them on Amazon.com.  We both thank you.",Sir Reginald will not go to sleep without these treats!,5

"Honestly, this is the best green tea I have tried so far.  I have tried many different brands of tea bags, and some other loose leaf teas.  This organic gunpowder, however, is the best I have tasted out of those and I think it is actually the most relaxing out of all of them.  I would definately order this product again and am willing to try some other green teas by Davison.",Excellent tea,5
Excellent,Awesome,5
"I bought a pack of these some months ago and ran out.  When we couldn't find them in the grocery store we came back and bought them again here.  What I like best about this tuna is that it is more natural than most of the other brands.  Suddenly they all seem to put soy in their tuna--this one does not.  It is also in water, not oil, and has less salt.  Best of all, my kids will eat it when I mix it into the mac and cheese.  My daughter hates tuna but will eat this and not even notice.","Good for you, not oily or fishy",5

"Wow, I wasn't sure what to expect given the mixed reviews.  So, I took other readers suggestions and spiced it up a little.  I added some rice, a half can of tomato paste to sweeten it. I also added 6 slices of jalepano with a tablespoon of the juice.  This is really good, and stays true to its intent.  Very healthy choice.<br /><br />For those of you who don't like the salt, just take a half of a small potato. Let it simmer and that will take care of the salt.","Yum, Yum, Yum",5

"This is tasty cereal.  It's kind of like Honey Nut Cheerios but a heck of a lot better! I'm a bit stanege since I don't really eat cereal the traditional way. I eat it ""dry"", sometimes strait from the box! I like this so much I went and bought three more boxes to put in my pantry!. I usually have some as a snack, as it's much better than chips and candy. The other day I ate some while watching a movie, instead of popcorn. This is very tasy stuff indeed and I hope Kelloggs keeps producing it. Hopefully enough people will like and buy it so it won't get discontunued.",Move over Honey Nut Cheerios!,5
"If you love a good Manhattan and especially enjoy the cherry at the end, these cherries are for you.<br /><br />Very dense, sweet and in a syrup, two cherries and a bit of syrup add a better sweet component than sweet vermouth.

That and these cherries will change your Manhattan experience forever",A new perspective on a Manhattan,5
"Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate are the flavors. Each is delicious and the price is unbeatable. Unlike other brands I've tried, like 4C, I've never gotten a packet where the powder has clumped up or been stubborn about mixing well inside the bottle when shaken.

"I don't get it -- everywhere I go now, mediocre coconut juice is in stores now for 5 times the price as this brand.  This brand uses young THAI coconut, which is far sweeter than the young coconut from the Caribbean and Brazil that other products use.  I am such a fanatic that I cut down several young coconuts fresh from trees while on trips to both Hawaii and Puerto Rico and those were not even as good as this product.  I've been fortunate enough to also sample fresh young coconut juice once while on a trip to Thailand and while, admittedly, this product was not quite as good as having it fresh off the tree in Thailand, it does give you an approximation of what that is like.","Like drinking from a young coconut, fresh off the tree!",5
"As a tea aficionado, I generally shop for tea by brand. I have had many, many brands of peppermint tea: this is the BEST hands-down. Pure, brisk unapologetically peppermint - not watered down with other mints or additional herbal ingredients as most other brands do. [By this same token:  beware if you don't necessarily want something this potently peppermint-y!] I love this tea - it's good for tummy upset, too.","If you like Peppermint tea, you will LOVE this brand!",5

"I am an a'cappella singer and I use ONLY Lakerol Special Menthol liqorice lozenges to soothe my throat - and they are sugar free!  I have tried other lozenges for dry, scratchy or sore throat, but others have sugar in them, which also irritates my throat.  Lakerols are also small in size and work very quickly to soothe and moisten.  With other lozenges, I have to deal with a large piece of candy which takes much longer to melt and to work.  I cannot use any other kind of lozenge for singing except Lakerols.",Lakerol,5

"So I had my first taste of Jamaica blue mountain coffee today and can honestly say it's the best, most smooth cup of coffee i've had. The smell when you first open the bag is divine, when you grind down the beans it only gets better. I use a Bruville single cup coffee maker to make my coffee so i'm not exactly sure if it would taste different with a drip coffee maker, i'll have to use one and then update this review. Not only can you smell the difference from your run of the mill coffee but you can see the difference as well,a dark rich looking cup but not overbearing or bitter just really smooth.

"This is the second time I've ordered this chocolate peanut butter, but I liked it so much that I ordered it in the 4 pack package.  I like it better than the regular version, probably because I am a chocoholic rather than a peanut butter enthusiast.  I especially like the fact that a two tablespoon portion of this chocolatey spread only has a one point value on Weight Watchers, not only making it a great snack but also a low point one.  I love putting it on a rice cake, either plain or with a tiny bit of preserves, or just eating it off the spoon!  I love this stuff!",A Chocolate Lover's Dream,5

"I am 50 year old and still have the same thick curly hair I did when I was 13.  I have been looking for the right mix of care products. Just last month I switched to three products:<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner,<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil,<br /><br />My hair is dryer now that I am older and the shampoo really does the trick of cleaning without destroying my hair, it cleanses completely to remove product build-up. The conditioner allows me to much more easily run a brush through my hair. Without flattening my hair it reduces the dryness that flat ironing can do and reduces breakage.  It really does lock in moisture and provide long lasting nourishment.  The Therapy works best on wet hair, it gives deep, non-greasy nourishment to my hair and lends a healthy looking shine.  I can wash, condition and therapy my hair Monday. Tuesday I can wet my hair put the therapy in and it looks brand new.<br /><br />The real test was going to my salon and my stylist of 8 years noticed the difference in softness. I love the blend of shea, vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm. It really works for me. I did find the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair.<br /><br />KEEPER!",in 4 weeks my stylist noticed the difference in health,5

"Well I just finished my first can and ordered more.  The nonfat stuff you buy in a cardboard box at the supermarket is just plain disgusting tasting-even mixed into sauces or with chocolate sauce added. So I thought maybe this whole milk powder might taste better. Night and day! This stuff is delicious-even just drinking as milk. I don't even use this as a ""survival"" food. I keep a can in the fridge (I don't know if that's required, but I feel if you can, it probably stays fresh longer) and I use it for all my milk needs, rather than buying a jug of milk and then throwing 1/3 away when it goes bad. I use this for sauces, in cereal, soups-in fact anywhere I want to use milk. And it is, as another reviewer put it: ""yummy"" stuff.",Excellent,5

"recently diagnosed with celiac, I've had to restructure my whole vision of food and snacks and how to stay healthy.  I've never had luck with nutrition/meal replacement bars in the past (can we say cardboard?), so I was leery when those on the celiac support boards kept singing the praises of Larabars.<br /><br />I picked up my first one at Whole Foods, and was worried with the high nut content -- I'm not known to be fond of nuts.  but after one bite, I discovered I LOVE nuts -- if they are in a Larabar.  the cherry bars are sweet and sure at the same time, just like fresh cherries.  the dates and nuts balance out the flavor experience.<br /><br />unlike other bars, these are soft and tasty, and beyond filling!  I can usually only nibble half at a time.  but now, I have something to keep in my purse or in my desk at work for emergency food.  everyone else can have a sandwich with their wheat filled bread, and I'm perfectly happy to munch away on my Larabar.",a life saver for those on a gluten-free diet,5

"I grew up drinking coffee in New Orleans.  I have been soooo disappointed with all of the K-cup coffees because they are so mild. After reading reviews, I decided to try all the ones that were said to be good, strong coffees.  First I tried Jet Fuel.  It is strong, but no taste.  Then I tried Paul Newmans dark roast.  It was so so, but nothing special.<br />I saw the Big Easy k-cup and thought, this must be it.  It is good. Don't get me wrong.  It is my second choice.  But the winner is  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond! It is really, really good.  If you like your coffee strong and bold with great flavor, this is the one.  I don't care what it costs.

It also is good if yoiu eat only  a bit of it at a time and refrigerate it.,"excellent taste, keeps away hunger",5
This new flavor is excellent! The hint of vanilla adds a wonderful flavor and aroma to the coffee. It is a great addition to the Senseo pod family.,Paris Vanilla Bistro is Perfect,5
Thanku so much. Good product ð,Brilliant,5
I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!,I'm addidcted to these!,5
Awesome,Classy product,5
These noodles are great if you like spicy food. I add a healthy amount of cayenne to mine and they are awesome.<br /><br />I have ordered at least 8 cases of these and have given several to friends. They are seriously good and worth the slightly higher price than inferior ramen. Tip: subscribe and you get 15% off. If you don't want more in a few months it is really easy to cancel.<br /><br />I like these so much I even wrote a blog post about them:  [...],Best ramen by far,5

"I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.<br /><br />Update: January 2012:<br /><br />Wellness Simple Solution Rice and Salmon is the only kibble that I feed to my bichon.  She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.",My sensitive Bichon loves this food. 2012 Update comment on Freshness,5

"This toy takes more effort to get food out than the Buster Cube, which I like because it occupies the dog longer.  I find that the cube, even on its ""hardest"" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it.  With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.<br /><br />At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full.  This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side.  This will encourage the dog to play with it.  Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle.  It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it.  She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out.  When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has.  Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day.",Good alternative to a Buster Cube,5

"This is by far the best GF pasta I've tried.  Holds up well when you cook your sauce/gravy and want to add pasta directly to the sauce/gravy.  Doesn't fall apart when stirring and will even hold up when refrigerated overnight and reheated and stirred in oven. Also, is great for cold pasta salads. Won't break down and pasta tastes like I remember regular pasta tasting like. I like that I could purchase in bulk since my local grocery store only carries one weird shape I don't like. It's great I can order here on Amazon.  Delivery was prompt and packed nicely.  No broken pasta.",Outstanding GF Pasta,5

"I am getting this regularly via subscribe and save option and I must say this is a pretty good deal given the quality of the product. Although the taste difference in organic vs regular Zoe oils is subtle, I like to believe going organic is good for me. If you know much about or have used olive oils regularly, you'd love the taste of this particular extra virgin olive oil. Apart from being healthy this is full flavored - real extra virgin and not diluted like many store brands- and comes in a can to protect the oil from exposure to direct sun light. Go for it, with free shipping, you can't go wrong.",Fair Deal,5

"Store mixes are just OK. My mother always made cakes from scratch and frosting. This cake mix tastes like homemade and we love them ...all of them. I am so excited to try the new ones coming out.<br /><br />Since I discovered these we have cupcakes in our house all the time. (No we are not fat)  One cupcake is equivalent to 1/2 piece cake.  I deplore store bought frosting in the can, always have.  This frosting takes homemade. Do yourself a big favor and use REAL butter in the frosting instead of the artificial stuff.  Makes all the difference in the world. Tastes just like Mom's.<br /><br />Kids will love the dots inside the cake. They show up well s long as you do not over beat the batter. The sprinkles for the frosting being all natural, are a real plus. You don't have to buy your own to add. It is just a thing with me, I have to have sprinkles on my cupcakes!<br /><br /> Side note, my Mom's dad was a farmer and they always ate lots of  butter and whole milk. My dad's dad was  farmer and ditto.  9 kids in mom's family and 4 in dad's. Of the total 13 kids, 3 have died and all were over 80. The remaining children are still alive are in  their late 80's and  90's. It appears Butter and  whole milk have not had a negative affect on them.<br /><br />Great cake mix and frosting mix. All natural and that is a wonderful thing.<br /><br />For those of you who have said the mix is not sweet enough, you can always add a little sugar! I think it is fine but have added extra sugar at times.",SIMPLY THE BEST!,5

"Ocean Spray 100% Juice is a mix of various juices (e.g. grape, apple, cranberry). I like it because it doesn't contain added corn syrup or sugar, just juice.

I do however agree Amazon should update the description to include ingredients, as they have with other flavors of the 100% Juice product line.",100% Juice,5

"I have long known that if my dogs had to rank their love for treats against their love for me, I'd probably rank first.....but it would be close.  And then we discovered the CET chews.  Not only would the CET chews win over me, my dogs would not hesitate to sell me in exchange for them.<br /><br />Every dog in our extended family is addicted.  I think they lace them with something.  Put them up against a regular rawhide and there is no contest.  We all gave each other chews as gifts for Christmas.  (Which in retrospect was dumb, we could have just kept them and saved on shipping...but who knew?)<br /><br />They do work for teeth cleaning by the way.  I have one dog, a rescue, who has some damaged teeth (one broken, others degraded).  He came to me that way.  I've had them cleaned by the vet more than once but since we've discovered a heart murmur sedating him for a cleaning is no longer an option.  The CET chews have helped.  His teeth are still not great, but there is a noticable improvement in the amount of gunk.  My other dog has nice mostly white teeth and the chews have really helped keep them that way.<br /><br />These were also wholeheartedly approved by my vet.<br /><br />And one last benefit...if you want your dog out from under foot for a few minutes these are also handy for that.  I do use them occasionally when I need some quiet or am feeling like there are just too many german shepherds in the house crowding me.  They happily take them to the back yard and chew away quietly.<br /><br />So big thumbs up here (or paws up, or dew claws up or....you know what I mean)",Doggie Crack....and they work,5

"I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo.  I've found many shampoos don't deliver on their promise to provide a clean clear scalp, while at the same time providing soft manageable hair, but this product delivered.<br /><br />The texture of the shampoo was very enjoyable, its thicker than most shampoos and creates a great lather.  Further the shampoo has a good scent, and won't leave you with a strong shampoo odor.  The overall odor of the shampoo is simple which is great for a guy.<br /><br />After using the shampoo for a short period of time I noticed that my scalp was increasingly clear of both dandruff, and other build up.  If you are a person that uses product in your hair, over time that build up can become very annoying, and this shampoo did a good job of clearing that up.  I have also suffered from having an itchy scalp at times, and this product worked better than other over the counter products that promise to relieve scalp problems.",Excellent shampoo,5
