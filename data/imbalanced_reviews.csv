BEWARE OF THIS BEING SHIPPED FROM AMAZON AS THEY ARE BAD!<br /><br />I ordered 30 Boxes or 6 orders of this six pack  of these to give to My kids for school.<br />But they where melted in the wrappers no once noticed until my kids got sick.<br /><br />On close inspection the Chocolate went bad and turned color to an ash color instead of its normal color and smelt funny.<br /><br />To see if these all went bad with all (6 Pack Bundles) I opened a box from each bundle  and only one had bars that were half melted and you could see how half the bar went bad and what the other half is supposed to look like.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in the quality that is shipped out consequently I also ordered the vanilla chipped ones and that arrived in the same box and they where fine.<br /><br />So they must of spoiled in Amazons warehouse.

"I ordered one of these cases (packages of six) to give as Christmas presents to multiple people.  Sadly, upon arrival, every single individual container was smashed open. The external box was not mangled - I have to believe this was a byproduct of the brittle, thin, flimsy individual plastic containers, in combination with having been shipped along with giant cashew tins in a large box with minimal packing materials. Although I think had the container packaging been sturdier this would not have been a problem. In any event, it was a disappointment that none of the packages arrived intact.","VERY flimsy containers, arrived all smashed up",1

"I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor. It tastes nothing like fruit or fruit punch. The only way I could describe this horrible flavor is if you took pink hand soap, diluted it tremendously and then dumped in a bunch of sweetener. That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.  Ultima and Accelerade both look promising. But I'm done with Cyto Max.",Tastes nasty,1

Do not order these in warm months as there is something lacking that causes them to melt unlike other brands. It made my heart jump when I first opened the box it looked that scary, kind of like a Halloween joke where you get the trick instead of the treat. I will stick with Haribo from now on.

I then received a notice of a shipping date that was almost 2 weeks from order date!  I had to then take my time and get stressed arguing with them about the fact that I'd paid extra for expidited shipping. I did get my shipping fees refunded, but not my coffee sooner.  So I had to then go out to a store to purchase coffee to use until the order from Amazon finally arrived, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place by placing the order on line.

"I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).",Not nutritionally sound,1

"""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate.

"This ""syrup"" is not very sweet and despite being labelled ""sweetened with splenda"" it has a very small amount as splenda is the last ingredient. The primary sweetner is acsulfame potassium which is nowhere as far as i am concerned. As a general rule if any deception in ingredients or labelling the product should be boycotted. Who wants to buy products from companies that want to deceive you into buying an inferior or cheaply made product. They find it easier to put a token amount of splenda so they can put it on the label and you will think better of the product. I only would buy this if there was no alternative available and it was necessary due to blood sugar level control otherwise pass on it. I hate food companies that lie. Even small lies. It is like a famous brand of shortening on the market that says 0 grams of trans fats on the label but in reality it is 100 percent hydrogenated oil which is trans fat. Even though the entire can is only trans fat they made the serving size so small that it contains less than 1 gram of trans fat so they can put contains 0 grams trans fat on the label to cheat their customers by deception.  Torani sugar free syrup would not sell much if they put sweetened with acsulfame potassium on the front of the bottle instead of splenda. Nuff said.","Not very sweet, splenda is minor ingredient",1

"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.",I'll never feed my dog's Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul or any other food made by Diamond,1

I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.

"As another reviewer has noted, Lindt has changed their previously great recipe as of Autumn 2010, and this chocolate now has the texture and taste of bottom-shelf waxy, cheap American dark chocolate.

"This is the worst gluten-free pancake mix I ever bought in my life!! First I tried it on a well-seasoned iron pan (we don't use ""nonstick"" pans here because teflon contains harmful chemicals). It stuck so badly after 2 tries that I had to soak the pan... not even brillo (which ruins pans) could get it off. Then, not wanting to waste the rest of the mix I'd made, I got out my nonstick waffle iron, adjusted the recipe and tried again. (I oiled it REALLY WELL with ghee, which works best as a cooking oil to prevent sticking). It stuck to the waffle iron so badly that I had to end up scraping it with a fork. I ruined the waffle iron's surface doing this. The taste of the scraps (I didn't want to throw them away) was all right, very ""gooey,"" but even the crispy parts got soggy in syrup more than most gluten-free mixes. If only they could find a way to get this to work I guess it would be all right but I am very frustrated right now after disappointing my daughter and ruining my favorite waffle iron and pan. I don't know what people who liked this product did to get it to work. BTW I don't use rice milk, we used regular dairy milk because we're not dairy-allergic or vegans.

"If you've ever had raw cacao nibs, you should realize immediately that these nibs are roasted.  I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they ""roast"" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that ""all cacao nibs have to be roasted...""  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products.",LIARS!!!!

"My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more ""crumbly"", i.e. there is a lot more ""food dust"" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called ""Simply Nourish"", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing ""Innova Cat & Kitten"", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!","Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!",1

Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine.",Is this even coffee?,1

I felt very confident in going with Arm & Hammer because of the 5 star ratings and reviews, but YUK!

"I have been drinking Ahmad English Afternoon Tea for several years and it has been my favorite black tea.<br /><br />I had been buying this tea at the ""British Isles"" store in Houston, Texas. However, a few years ago I moved to Hawaii, and had to order this tea from Amazon.com<br /><br />I bought 6 boxes of 50 bags of the Ahmad English Afternoon Tea and upon opening the boxes the first thing I noticed was a VERY strong smell of bergamot. Upon brewing the tea,<br />the taste and smell of bergamot was overwhelming. I think the bergamot is even stronger than Earl Gray tea. So I am sadly disappointed that this Ahmad English Afternoon Tea was<br />very different from the one I had been buying for years.<br /><br />Maybe the blend was recently changed? Could it be a quality control issue?

My taste may be different to most other people because of my diet, but the macadamia nuts are blended with PEANUT OIL and that is ALL that I taste, smell, and feel on my tongue. Peanut, oil, yuck. I even tried baking what I had into a dish, tried puting it on top of something to add some flavor. I still only taste, smell, and feel peanut oil. Maybe the company thinks that is ok, but in my opinion if someone is buying something niche like macadamia nut butter, it should be macadamias and maybe salt.",YUCK,1

"I woke up today, Sunday, to find my Sunday newspaper for the Chicago Tribune wrapped in a plastic bag with the words, ""our instant tastes rich not expensive (sorry Starbucks)""<br /><br />Naturally, I decided to put your Taster's Choice packet to the test.  Could you please define the word ""rich"" according to your dictionary.  To the rest of the world, rich implies full-bodied in a drink.  Nothing about your instant coffee is rich.  It is quite the opposite actually.  The finished product with 6oz of water look exactly like that, dirty water.  Looks like something that would come out of my rain gutter, not my coffee pot.<br /><br />It's tastes is repulsive.  In fact, if I liked drinking hot water, you might have a market.<br /><br />I would reason that the fact your coffee costs ""4x less than Starbucks Via"" is because it is made with 4x less quality.  The taste is in the cup.  You should be embarrassed that you call yourself ""Taster's Choice""  Who's choice?  A zombie?<br /><br />Also, how low can you go?  Your text font on your bag is exactly as Starbucks VIA in their stores.  Come on!  Be original!  Don't sit on the defensive side and use the same ideas as others.  It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster's Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, as a coffee lover, I will make sure everyone I know makes ""the smart choice"" and chooses anything BUT Taster's Choice!",Nescafe a joke!,1

"Typically, if I leave a negative review for any product, I still recommend others trying it, since they may like it, and I always state so, in my review.  However, NOT this time!<br /><br />Like the previous reviewer, my cake stuck horribly to the pan, and I used a flat, round pan.  I not only oiled my pan, but floured it thoroughly, as well.  Any other time I bake a cake, I always, always use this method:  Oil & flour.  The cakes always pop right out of the pan, with no problem.  NOT this time!  This was a complete mess!<br /><br />Even edging with a knife didn't help!  So, I would actually not recommend this at all.  If this is a new product, I guarantee in one year, it will be a forgotten, discontinued product, because that's what you will want to do, once you try this:  Forget it, and never use it again!<br /><br />But, because I like to be fair, I do love Duncan Hines.  They do have some great products, just not this one.  This was a miss.  Additionally, I figured that even though the cake stuck horribly to the pan, maybe it would taste good and that would suffice.  Not this time!  This cake, on a scale from 1-5, taste wise, would honestly be a 3, if that.  It's just ok.<br /><br />So, my take is:  Don't waste your time.  Like myself and the previous reviewer, you will most likely find yourself in the same situation:  A stuck mess, that is worthy of file 13 - the trash!!!<br /><br />And, by the way, the picture on the box, looks nothing at all, like what you end up with.  The picture has glaze on the top.  Not so with this recipe, unless you buy it, or make it!  That, in and of itself, is misleading.

"Check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the Amazon page.<br /><br />Is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word Omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them? Nature's Path does not tell us which Omega 6s or Omega 3s it contains. Beneficial Omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax. Omega 6s are generally what we get from corn-fed stockyard beef. Or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil.<br /><br />Note that this product contains 900 mg of Omega 6s and 400 mg of Omega 3s. More than twice as much of Omega 6s as Omega 3s. The typical, god-awful American diet contains a ratio of 20:l Omega 6s to Omega 3s. Nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3:1 ration of Omega 3s to Omega 6s.<br /><br />Large studies are indicating that Omega 3s help the cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation, may have a helpful role in preventing cancer, improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias. Are these studies far enough along to be conclusive? No. Are they pointing us in some healthy directions?  Yes.  Are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies, but human studies?  Yes.<br /><br />The most positive results so far indicate that Omega 3s are very good for our hearts.<br /><br />So, you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola, flax seed, raisins, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds. What are they using these fiber-rich foods for? The box?<br /><br />You also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - FOURTEEN - grams! of sugar, along with some saturated fat.<br /><br />I've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and I'm shocked to see that there is NO  nutritional value in any of the bars produced by Nature's Path Organic. I decided to check out Nature's Path cereals, etc., and found the same garbage.<br /><br />The words organic, nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies, but this is the most egregious example I've seen in a while. I'd like to see Amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products. In the meantime, we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn. We need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores, supermarkets, food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co-op. We need to keep ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy, well-nourished and strong.<br /><br />Best to all.",This is trash. This is not food.,1

"I have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years. It was the only canned turkey sold in North America that contained no food additives. It was just turkey, water, and sea salt.<br /><br />As of this month( March 2011) new labelling and contents have appeared. The label now proclaims ""Better Flavor"".<br /><br />The product now contains 50% more sodium - at a time when many manufacturers are either cutting back on salt content or introducing ""reduced sodium"" vesions of their tradtional products.<br /><br />Worse yet, the ""Better Flavor"" is achieved by adding ""rice starch"", ""vegetable starch"" ( a call to the company revealed that this is potato starch) and ""broth"" - which contains, among other listed ingredients, ""natural flavor"" (derived from corn - an increasingly common food allergen ).<br /><br />This product is now useless to me as I am highly sensitive to corn products. While the label still claims the product is gluten free, which was pretty much guaranteed before, since it had only turkey, water and sea salt in it, this claim is now somewhat suspect in as much as with the introduction of each new additive, there is the possiblitly of cross contamination in the prodution of the various grain based starches and ""flavors""<br /><br />The company needs to re-think this change. What made them unique and a mainstay for people on specialized diets, was their plain and simple good food. Now they are little different from every other canned meat that is adulterated with unecessary and unwanted food additives.<br /><br />They can kiss goodbye all their former customers who are allergic to or sensitive to corn, processed starches, who are on the Atkins or no grain diets, who have arthritis which is exacerbated by potatoes, and who avoid processed food additives in general.<br /><br />The company also needs to be more up front in their new labelling and say ""potato starch"" rather than ""vegetable starch"" AND in bold print say ""Contains Corn"" to warn customers who are allergic to corn products that they probably should now avoid the product.<br /><br />Hopefully this ""Better Flavor"" change will be about as successful as New Coke"" and we will see Valley Fresh ""Classic"" Turkey in a year so.",Not as Natural Anymore,1

"This is the second ""Tug-a-Jug"" food puzzle I've purchased for my wire fox terrier. The first lasted about five months until she chewed through the rope. But this toy kept my dog more occupied than any other food puzzle I've tried, so I decided to purchase a second one. My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't ""play"" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.<br /><br />But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.<br /><br />My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud. But after that, I'm totally done with this company. The shards that came off in my hand were tiny and sharp enough that if just one shard had broken off without my notice and go mixed in with my dog's food, she probably would have ingested it and had internal bleeding.",Dangerous and not durable,1

"I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best ""bang for the buck"" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing.

At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes?

Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference.

So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.  Unfortunately, this was just bad.  When I opened the pouch, it smelled bitter.  When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.  However, this smelled bad to me (a non-coffee drinker who loves the smell of brewing coffee), and even flavored creamer couldn't make it palatable for my husband. The price is reasonable, but I just can't recommend it.",smelled & tasted burnt,1
"I have the feeling that people are either going to love this or hate it.  For me, I hated it.  The salt and pepper combo is extremely aggressive.  The chunks of salt are so large that sometimes they make a {crunch} when you bite down on a particularly large one.  The pepper is also large flakes and there is a lot of it.<br /><br />After just a few of these I felt a bit sick to my stomach and now even the thought of them makes me a little queasy.  I have loved the Emerald product line up until this one.  I do give them respect for taking chances but I think they went too aggressive on this one.","Bold, but not for me",1

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1

"Kefir is SOOOO good for you, and Cultures for Health is a great company to buy from. The milk kefir grains from CFH were great, and my child thoroughly enjoyed the milk kefir. I noticed a calming effect from it (likely the B Vitamins). They helped with our gut and regularity immensely.<br /><br />However, this is NOT a Cultures for Health company product. It is from 'Lifetime kefir."" I've never written a review before, and I do buy items very frequently online. I'm usually easy going with how things turn out through the mail. It arrived VERY warm and wet and in a PLASTIC bag. The dried kefir is much more shelf-stable through the mail and arrives in better packaging that doesn't leach chemicals into the product. Shipping was much slower than expected. It ended up shipping separately from my other items and arrived several days after the others. This is questionable whether it is safe to use because of the heat (it's summer here!) and plastic, and I certainly cannot give this to my small immune-compromised child of which is why I ordered this in the first place. For the customer service, I cannot yet say how they handled this issue, but I'm hoping for a full refund, shipping cost in all. I will update on the customer service aspect. Order directly from CFH.

"I have used this before, and like the coffee. But was not aware of the different strengths. Saw a statement about them as I reviewed today (in ""product features"" it says, ""Please note: 'regular', 'bold' and 'extra bold' refer to the amount of coffee in the K-Cup""). There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.<br /><br />So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).<br /><br />Very, very disappointed!<br /><br />PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was ""Light Roast"".

"I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.  They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian.<br /><br />Here is the definition from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.<br /><br />Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is.  Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side.  I hope this is helpful.  Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian.<br /><br />thank you,",THESE ARE NOT VEGETARIAN,1
"This was the first kind my family and I bought.  Lucky for me I didn't let it stop me from trying the golden flax flavor.

I know coconut oil in it's raw form is really good in our diets and on our skin. After some google research I found out that Hydrogentated Coconut Oil is created by heating to 500-1000 degrees, then a catalyst is injected.

"I love this product, but I'll never by online again.  As near as I can tell not a single container was broken in my package, so I am guessing some other box broke and dripped into the packages Amazon shipped to me.  My wife has a sort of ant phobia, so when we opened this and about a thousand big nasty ants jumped out, it was not a good day at my home.  I had to take all the product outside in a laundry basket and hose it all off, after having ""stomp dance"" on all the little buggers that had escaped into the house.  After cleaning it off, I had to pick through every one of the containers to make sure they were sealed and had no ants within.  That's why I'm fairly sure some other package dripped into mine, I found no damage to any of the containers in my shipment.<br />(I see other reviews here where people received damaged packages with empty containers within - hey, I know where your creamer went!)<br />I don't even think they were ""my"" ants, these were of a type I've never seen before, I think they hitched a ride somewhere in transport, but there are so many species of these things only a bug expert could know for sure where they came from.<br />Since this stuff is fulfilled by Amazon from one of their warehouses, I'm pinning the blame on Amazon for this one.  It was a ""no-think"" to ship a product that had insect attractant (the product itself) dripped into it in storage.  At the minimum they should have sealed the box all the way around before shipping, which had not been done.  I'm not sure any packaging other then some foil sealed container would have helped keep ants out, they should have discarded the soiled product and only shipped clean packages.<br />If I ever order this stuff online again, I'm likely to be divorced.  No more consumables from Amazon that might attract bugs in shipping.  Your loss Amazon.",Bad packaging - I got a box full of large ugly ants,1
"CLAXTON FRUIT CAKE (3lb.) AMAZON REVIEW<br /><br />Credit cards are weird.  I mean, you wann 'em, and if you play your cards right over time, you gott 'em. But ahh, the catch.  If you don't use 'em, you might just lose 'em.  What's all of this have to do with fruitcake?  Well, sans any fruitcake jokes, please stand by...<br /><br />Recently, I've lost a couple of hard-earned credit cards, due to ""lack of use.""  Really?  I mean, really?!!  Is this what America has come down to?  I do all I can to establish or re-establish my basic U.S. dollar, human worthiness for unsolicited credit card offers, only to get a few, only to lose out when I don't use them for awhile?  Without warning.  ZAP!  They're gone.  Seems ""they"" want you to have the cards, but if you go overboard with them, they hound you to no end, but then, if you don't use them, or even forget you had one, they cut you off and cancel your card.  Fruitcake, I say!  Fruitcake!<br /><br />So it was, after I learned these things and more, that I told myself, with one card, hey, I better USE this or LOSE it.  Having nothing really I wanted or needed at the time (all you NEED is love...), I ordered this product from Amazon.  Through one of those cards I feared losing soon, unless I used it.  But after ordering, receiving, and trying this particular product (some supposed ""gourmet"" fruitcake), I can only report that this was/isss overall, much less than I expected.  In other words, this is pretty bad fruitcake, in my opinion, and for the price, really bad.  If you are at all in my situation, I strongly suggest that you use any under-used credit card funds or other ""disposable income"" on something else.  Cause this is pretty bad fruitcake.<br /><br />Now, before you cut me to the quick, and question either/or my knowledge and experience of/with said fruitcake product, let me just say that I've been getting fruitcakes as gifts (usually around Christmas), for a long, long, long, long time.  Ever since I care to remember actually.  I think I remember that once upon a time, I casually mentioned to family, friends, or others, that I liked fruitcake.  I actually, generally LIKED fruitcake.  Well, soon the word spread, and I've been given them by family, friends, or other over the ages.  Not that I'm complaining, because I DO LIKE FRUITCAKE!  There, I said it all.  But...this particular fruitcake brand?  Fairly average at best, but compared to the cost, pretty awful.<br /><br />Oh, believe me dear readers and followers, I WANTED to like this.  I really did.  An impulse buy at the time, all I wanted really was some half-decent fruitcake and an inexpensive means to keeping a credit card alive and kicking.  Well, big, impulsive mistake, because, according to my taste, and my own decades-long relationship with fruitcakes in general, this is not very good.  And it is only my history of loving almost EVERY fruitcake I've ever had, which guides to you, my fellow fruitcake lover, away from buying anything more than a sample of this product.  And please don't make the mistake I made when I ordered taste-unseen, three single fruitcakes, when the purchase of even one would've told me the story here.<br /><br />I realize with this review that I may go against the grain (though not fiber-wise) in dissing this, but I'm just coming from a long history of fruitcake enjoyment and this doesn't even come close in quality, taste, and otherwise, to fruitcakes enjoyed past, present, and future.  Heck, this isn't even ""cake"" at all.  It's like this big, thick, DOUGH, with TOO many TOO sweet ""fruits,"" and the nuts were pretty dry and unmemorable.  Heck, I don't even LIKE sweets generally.  I'd much rather have a bowl of cheese crackers or chips than a bowl full of M&M's or Reese's peanut butter cups or chunkey monkey or any other such sickenly sweet thing.  But heck, just about the ONLY sweet I've ever really loved, was/is fruitcake.  So, why was/is this so disappointing, and so overpriced?<br /><br />I think this is the fruitcake equivalent of fruitcake DOUGH.  Like cookie-dough ice-cream, which I've always thought too weird and not really concentrating on the essentials.  This is like eating fruitcake DOUGH, before any baking.  And that, ain't good.  Fruitcake should be CAKE, not uncooked DOUGH.  And that's what this is really.  In the end, wholly unacceptable, and to go technical on you'all, pretty darn yucky, you betcha!  Only my opinion...try a sample before ordering anything more than that.<br /><br />Judging by the generally favorable opinions about this specific fruitcake I've found here on Amazon, I may never know if this is just me, or what.  This has generally high reviews, but I only managed to finish ONE of the THREE individual pounds I ordered and was sent (and btw, Amazon delivered nice and fast and easy as usual), and was just gonna GIVE the rest away, but I think I would've felt guilty about subjecting anyone else to this, so I just threw the other two pound ""cakes"" away.  Maybe the rats or worms will like it, I don't know.<br /><br />Basically, to make a long, boring, but hopefully humorous story short, I suggest buyer beware on this, and buy/try the smallest portion/size you can.  If you like this thick, tasteless in many ways, un-fruitcake, by all means, purchase away.  But I can't give this any kind of enthusiastic thumbs up, as far as fruitcakes go.  And wouldn't ya know it, the instructions for use are virtually non-existent, with no manual, no software, and little documentation as to why and how I'm supposed to actually enjoy this doughy mess.  And no real warranty!  Fruitcake lover/buyer beware...<br /><br />To all fellow outcast, strange dog, hopelessly romantic, secret fruitcake lovers, my small minority brothers and sisters who KNOW good fruitcake from bad, let me just say that this is nowhere near worth the asking price.  To those of you who've tried this and actually liked it, I can only suggest you expand your fruitcake worldview and experience to other brands because this just ain't that good.  A cheap dollar store variety is better than this, IMHO.  One thing for sure though, next hardly used credit card purchase goes to another gift card for someone else, for something other than such a bad product as bad as this...","I never met a fruitcake I didn't like, until now...",1

"I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.","Sickening filler ingredients, high price",1

When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past.

Ultimately, I veered away from the instructions and put less powder in (about 1 and 1/2 tbsp). Works alright that way. I also added cold half and half after I'd made the cocoa sometimes, which was nice (of course it diluted the flavor, but I didn't mind). I tried one reviewer's suggestion of adding salt--it was actually really nice that way! It's best mixed with coffee. Definitely not worth the price, though. My boyfriend absolutely will not drink it.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1
I've bought this product from Amazon for almost two years for $20.19 shipped by Amazon as an Amazon Prime product.

"Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always!

I had hoped to use this as a table condiment, but felt it detracted from the food rather than enhancing it.  I then tried it while cooking and felt it fell short there as well.  I ended up trashing it, thereby making it the most expensive salt I had ever purchased.<br /><br />I love the Artisan smoked salts I have purchased on Amazon and intend to buy several other varieties of that brand.  While initially more expensive, I can wholeheartedly recommend that brand.  Sadly, I cannot recommend the Marshalls Creek brand.",Can't recommend this salt to anyone.,1

"Bought this REALLY hoping to like it, as Stonewall's Jerquee is so expensive, but this stuff is repulsive.  For one thing, isn't jerky, by definition, supposed to be dry?  This stuff comes covered in a greasy, slimy coating.  After trying hard to get passed that, on to the actual jerky...it's not chewy, like jerky is supposed to be, it is too easy to bite off a piece.  And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.

"My wife has been drinking Decaffeniated, Sugar free Suisse Mocha (General Foods International Coffee) for years, but the latest batches we purchased are significantly different than earlier mixes.  The coffee has a much sweeter and very unpleasant flavor.  In addition, after drinking a small amount from three different cans, she became quite nauseated.  At first we thought we had simply gotten a bad batch when we ordered through Amazon, but we purchased more from a local grocery store and it was the same story.  We also noticed that a label on top of the cans now reads: ""Coming up this summer! Look for our same great-tasting, indulgent cafe-style beverages under our new name:  Maxwell House International Cafe.""<br /><br />From this, I assume General Foods has sold ""International Coffees"" to Maxwell House.  Whatever has happened, the change in formulation has ruined what was an excellent beverage.  I realize taste is a matter of personal preference, but the fact that the coffee mix made my wife ill (three different cans of it, purchased from different places) leads me to believe that others should avoid this product.",Apparent Change in Formulation,1

By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health.

The third bar was ok, but then it was almost every bar after that was bad. I ended upo throwing the last few bars away. The packaging was sealed properly and it was well within it's expiration date.

"I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.","Sickening filler ingredients, high price",1

"Taste of the Wild has recently issued a recall. I ordered this from Amazon and got a tainted bag of food. I am currently on the phone trying to get ahold of the dog food company's customer service. I'll post with an update of what they say to do, and then may contact Amazon. (Hopefully shipping back will not have to happen - the idea of shipping 30lb of dog food does not appeal). In the mean time, hold off on ordering this food until Amazon can assure us that they will not send tainted products. Here is the article about the recall.<br /><br />When Diamond Pet Products recalled their Chicken Soup for the Soul food, I expected a recall of Taste of the Wild to follow. The holistic, grain-free food is made by the same company.<br /><br />And today comes word that, indeed, Diamond Pet Foods has issued a recall of a limited run of Taste of the Wild dry dog food over concerns about possible Salmonella contamination.<br /><br />According to the press release:<br /><br />To determine if your pet food is recalled, consumers should check the production codes on the back of bags. Any production codes that have a number ""2"" or a ""3"" in the 9th or 10th digit and an ""X"" in the 11th digit in the production code should be discarded. The best before dates are December 9, 2012, through April 7, 2013.<br /><br />The recall affects only products distributed in the following U.S. states and Canada.

"I should start off by saying that I have never understood the appeal of artificial chocolate flavoring.  Even when I was a kid and a total junk food junkie, the things that were artificially flavored chocolate always tasted strange.<br /><br />Fast forward to my life as an adult and I find that neither has the technology behind artificial chocolate flavoring improved, nor my opinion of it. It still has a subtle (and sometimes, not-so-subtle) metallic taste and an obvious artificial one. So do many artificial flavorings, but most seem to replicate the real thing about 75-80% of the time. Not so with artificial chocolate.<br /><br />So then, it will come as no surprise that this K-Cup variety is equally disappointing. Imagine the most mass-produced chocolate doughnut with a laundry list of ingredients (and unpronounceable ones at that) and one pretty much has the taste of this coffee flavor---at best.  It's not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that's not saying much.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it's ""like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut"" or ""tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee"". No, and no!  It's also a far cry from ""cafe mocha"", as well.  Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience.<br /><br />It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all.  If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst.<br /><br />I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer's [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor.

"I have been buying Friskies dry cat food, mainly their seafood flavor but sometimes others, for 4+ years. My cats liked the taste and for the cheap price compared to others I was satisfied.<br />Until they changed the bag design, that is. I say bag because that is what the label said. ""different bag, same great taste"" or something like that.  When I picked the bag up from Target, I had expected to see the same food I had always bought.  When I opened it, I quickly realized this was not the same food.  The shapes were the same, but the colors were noticeably brighter and more vibrant.  It was eye-appealing, but apparently not taste-appealing.<br /><br />My cats barely touched it, one of them didn't eat it at all.  And when they munched it down reluctantly, they threw up and got diarrhea. ALL of them. We had to throw the junk out and buy a bag of something else.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my lack of money has forced be to purchase Friskies on and off frequently over the past year, though I no longer buy that flavor, OR the flavor of the bright orange bag. The other flavors seem a bit milder, and the cats only throw up every once in awhile, though they still get cases of diarrhea too often. If I had enough money I'd check them out at the vet (along with getting the cat-food tested).  Recently though I found another bag of dried cat-food that was a bit cheaper than Friskies and there's been a definite improvement in their stools since they tried it. No one has thrown-up. I may just stick with this one.<br /><br />I've looked up information about Friskies, and while I never expected them to be top-quality for the cheap price, I was more or less disturbed by the constant complaints customers had.

Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular.",Greenies Lite - Not for dogs who had the taste of regular Greenies,1

"I've been waiting 18 days for this to arrive a finally it did. So I immediately check the ingredients on the back to find that the Main Ingredient is NOT Monk Fruit Concentrate, but INULIN (a cheap starchy filler that IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU and can have severe side effects including anaphylactic shock). I urge you to do your homework on inulin.<br /><br />INULIN has shown to not only feed good bacteria in your stomach, but ALSO bad bacteria such as Klebsiella. Recent studies have shown that inulin encourages the growth of Klebsiella, a bacteria implicated in Ankylosing Spondylitis and in increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut). Although Klebsiella is present in the colon of most people, it is held in check by beneficial bacteria and is harmless WITHIN the colon. But once it gets to other areas of the body, Klebsiella becomes a major cause of pneumonia, infections in the urinary tract and in wounds...and sometimes death.<br /><br />This ""Lo Han"" product also contains silica.

"First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't.",You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.,1

"As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,""<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field.

"My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.","Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive",1
"I bought this butternut squash to make pies and squash soup for the Holidays. Sadly, out of the case of 12, only 2 cans were useable. The others were dented beyond belief, and the two that I used had ""puree"" as thick as playdough. It did not mix well with the half & half, sugar & spices, although I was using the soup recipe provided on the side of the can, omitting the onion. So, I made 1 pie & 1 batch of soup. Both tasted very metallic and left a bad, twangy aftertaste in your mouth. No one could finish their slice of pie because of the metallic taste. What a waste of money this was. This is a shame, too, because canned squash is so hard to find. Next time, I'll read the reviews before purchasing a food product.

"I got my Aerogarden, despite the many bad reviews on the faulty pumps.  I<br />figured that surely it wasn't a widespread problem.  I had about a week of happiness, watching most of my plants sprout.  A buzzing sound started within 10 days, but it was bearable.  In about 15 days, the pump could be heard in the kitchen AND the living room.  After 20 days, I had to move the Aerogarden to the only room in the house where there were no occupants most of the day - the utility room.  To say it is loud is an understatement.  I have called the Aerogarden help line.  They told me that they had replaced the pumps with a different kind, since they were having trouble with the old ones.  These new ones just weren't working out either, apparently.  They would replace mine immediately.  I have a black Aerogarden, but the customer service rep told me I could get a white replacement pump faster than a black one!!!  I agreed to the white pump, but now I'm not sure I can wait for even that to come in.  I am pretty sure I will have to pull the plug on my garden.  The noise is awful, and I'm willing to sacrifice my herbs for my sanity.  They agreed to send me a replacement herb kit for the herbs I will lose.  Another problem I have:  no cilantro sprouts at all.  They have apparently also had trouble with these, and the cilantro is now not covered under their guarantee of growth.  They WILL send you a different herb.  I guess it is my bad luck that I bought this mainly for the cilantro!!  The rest of the herbs seem to be thriving.  Too bad I am getting ready to sacrifice them for some peace and quiet.<br /><br />This is a very interesting kit, but you would be wise to assume that the faulty pump will happen to YOU too.  You would think that the pump problem would be ironed out by now - I have spent a lot of time researching this - most of my time spent AFTER I bought it - and this has been going on for a long time.  Not much quality for your money.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/27/07  Company has not provided a replacement pump as promised, however, here is temporary fix for the obnoxious pump noise.<br /><br />From your plumbing or home supply store, obtain plumber's silicon grease.  After removing the pump from the base, (using a small philips driver), remove the front cover and small diffuser plate from the pump.  Fingers will do.  The pump impeller will be exposed, then lift the impeller off of the spindle.  Using the plumber's grease, apply enough to coat the round magnet on the impeller shaft, making sure that there's enough to fill the gap between the magnet and rotor hole.  Re-assemble the whole thing and treat yourself to silence.  If the noise comes back in a day or two, then you didnt use enough grease.  This grease is not petroleum based and does not contaminate the water, its milky clear and easy to use.<br /><br />The basic problem with this pump appears to be that the rotor bearing surface is not hard enough to resist wear and just a small amount of additional clearance between the rotor and rotor shaft due to wear allows the rotor to chatter.  The purpose of the grease is not necessarily to lube the rotor bearing surface, but to dampen the rotating resonance effects inherent in the design.  The best fix is of course to replace the cheap pump with a better design.  You'd think that for $140, AG could spend an extra 75 cents for something that lasts.  Hey AG, though I may have tried, I could not polish this turd.","Great herbs, terrible noise",2

"Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel.

I read all the reviews -- positive and negative -- and decided to take a chance on this one. It arrived today, and although there are some neat flavors that I am anxious to try, there is VERY LITTLE variety. I ordered the 24-count sampler. Out of these, 4 k-cups are truly unique/limited edition flavors that are not Green Mountain. That leaves 20 k-cups of Green Mountain that either French Vanilla (the majority), Caramel Vanilla Cream, Blueberry or Hazelnut. Luckily, these are at least flavors I like, they are just not all that unique. Probably won't order from these folks again, due to the lack of variety. I was really hoping for more choices, like the one that came with my Keurig (the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies, some I hadn't heard of and were quite good).

Therefore, I can't really enjoy them and am going to give most of them away. For taste alone (disregarding the trans fat content), I'd give these 4 stars. They're pretty good taste-wise.

"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).",Tasty but with a big drawback,2
"I appreciate a few things about this milk, but the off-putting flavor of it overrides the benefits. The first thing I noticed upon opening the can was the strong ""evaporated milk"" odor that you smell when you're using evap. milk from a cow. It's an unpleasant odor no matter the source. When I reconstituted the goat milk according to the directions (1 can milk to one can water) it tasted absolutely DREADFUL like a mouth full of thick, salty grossness. I tried diluting it with approximately 3 more cans of water, which seemed to cut the awful saltiness. What's left is a slight ""barnyard"" taste/smell with a little salt on the side. I imagine it might be alright if it's mixed in something, but it's certainly no substitute for the flavor of cow's milk. I would only use this product for cooking if I absolutely had to.",Very Salty!,2

"I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did.",Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia,2
"When I saw this product on the shelf at Wal-Mart, I instantly tossed it into my cart (both medium and light roast).  I like to have a supply of different coffees on hand.  I immediately made a cup when I got home from the store.  Actually, I love the flavor.  It is easy on the tongue, and leaves the mouth refreshed.  I thought there was something odd about the K-Cup itself, different sound when shaken, and appeared to be empty after use!  I did some quick surgery on the Cup and realized that I have been duped.  While I would still drink this had it been advertised honestly, because it has great flavor, I do not care to reward dishonesty and deceptive advertising.  It seems that rather than conducting any research to find the best combination of flavors, they chose to use word-tricks and lies.  Shame on them!",deceptive advertising,2

You just have to pick and choose which products are actually beneficial for you...and some you can buy in a different brand but the same basic product.  As for this icing, I plan to make my own once I am done using the one jar for my class.  Actually, you are supposed to make your own batch of icing for the second class session, so maybe it will taste a little better even made with Crisco.  I'm going to switch to REAL buttercream with BUTTER after the class.  You can also use the 40% or 50% off coupons in the paper or online to buy the meringue powder from one of the craft stores, which is a good deal.",Not a good taste,2

"Unless you are already feeding your dog a low end dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is not something I'd recommend feeding to your pet.<br /><br />I try to feed our dog better grade dog food.  Right now he is eating Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix.  There are several other high quality pet foods available.<br /><br />If you'd rather skip this review and are looking for a better quality dog food, there are several out there, some of which strive to serve ""natural/organic"" products.  Here are justa few, listed alphabetically:  Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, Merrick (who recently merged with Castor and Pollux), and Wellness.<br /><br />Chef Michael's is a Purina product.  While not trying to malign Purina, I am not aware of any better quality dog foods they produce.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order, directly from the label:<br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. C-5900.<br /><br />Nothing against beef for my dog, so it doesn't start out bad.  But after that....soybean meal and soy flour are just ""protein fillers"".  The next largest ingredient is animal fat.  Animal fat can come from numerous sources, including rodents, diseased animals, and you really just don't know the source.  After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is ""chewy"" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a ""candy"" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all.",Low Quality Dog Food,2

It's the usual ""boring"" food, all the same shape and color, little round brown balls. So when I opened this bag of Chef Michael's and put some in their bowl they loved it! After all this is a change, but is it a good change? Like other reviewers I'm not impressed with the ingredient list. For the price it seems like there are far too many fillers in the food. And the food is a bit ""moist"" and in my experience working in a pet store dog food with moisture can easily start to bread mold and other bacteria. I'm not saying this bag had mold but it's a concern I have. My dogs did like this food, it's a nice treat for them but I think I'll stick with my current brand. Sure I'm paying about 25% more per bag when matching pound for pound but the food I feed them now doesn't contain the fillers, doesn't contain the coloring and doesn't have moisture built into it which creates some worry but also creates more weight so all in all it's less food when you consider it. Plus in my house my dogs don't do well with moist foods. It creates a mess on the back end if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I would pass on this, it's ok for the occasional treat or change if you want to mix it up a little bit (ensure you do so responsibly so you don't get your dogs sick), but I wouldn't make this a daily food for them.","It looks pretty, but in the end not so much",2

"Blackberry and pomegranate, green tea, and honey sounds like a lovely combination. Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise.",real sugar AND fake sugar - the worst of both worlds,2

"The ingredients of this sweetener are as follows:  Erythritol, Sugar, Monk Fruit Extract, Molasses.  Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that can occur naturally.  So that makes this sweetener ""100% Natural,"" as emblazoned on the box.  The problem is, I detect a distinctly chemical aftertaste.  It could be the molasses, but it tastes more chemical than molasses to me.<br /><br />I am not such a purist about my artificial sweeteners.  But I do expect them to taste like sugar - and one would think, with sugar being the second ingredient, this one would have an advantage.  Not so.

"I was excited to try this product, as I usually have bars for breakfast, but it is getting harder to find ones that have good nutritional profiles in breakfast-appropriate (i.e., non-chocolate) flavors.  I love cranberry, so this bar seemed nearly perfect, especially given that I checked out the nutritional content prior to ordering.  At 4 grams, the amount of protein was a bit low for my liking, but the bar made up for this by being low in both sugar (12 grams) and saturated fat (1 gram) while being very high in fiber (7 grams).<br /><br />The texture of this bar is the first thing that struck me as a bit odd.  Although it is moist (i.e., as opposed to hard and crunchy), it is not chewy; in fact, it breaks apart easily and is a bit on the crumbly side.  (I suppose it is somewhat similar to a a CLIF brand bar.)  The taste, however, was quite disappointing:  rather than the tart taste of cranberry or the sweetness of orange, I detected only a bitter flavor.  It tasted almost as if the bar had been flavored with the bitter rind of the orange.  There did seem to be little fruit pieces in the bar that may have been cranberry, but unfortunately, the unpleasant bitterness overpowered everything else.<br /><br />I thought the first bar that I tried was just okay, but the second one seemed worse, and now I'm afraid I might have to toss the whole box (which I HATE to do--I hate being wasteful, so I might try dipping them in yogurt or something just to get through them).

"Got BabyBrezza 5 month ago. Nice for steaming, but blending never worked properly. Here is why:<br />1. When you steam the food a lot of water gets accumulated in the food container - too much, so before I blend I have to get some water out. The instructions said that you can get water in the food container if you put too much water in the water chamber - this not true, I tried everything and no matter what there is just too much water in the food container.<br />2. The food is not blended enough to be as smooth as the babies prefer there food, so I ended up blending the steamed food in the blender. And, there are always a couple of chunky peaces in the bottom of the container after blending. Fine, I could use the blending function on a later stage, I thought. But...<br />3. After 4 month of use (mostly for steaming), the blending function is not working. The machine makes a loud noise but the blades do not move.

As far as licorice goes this one is just so so. If you love real licorice buy RJ's that in my opinion is by far the best there is. This one has great texture and a good initial taste but then a strange bitter note like that of blackstrap molasses hits your tongue and a an unpleasant sulpfur after taste that lingers. It is too sweet and almost more of an anise flavor then real pure licorice. I don't know whats in it it came in a clear bag twist tied from a health food store locally. If you love blackstrap you may like it. I much prefer RJ's it is all natural and much better in both texture and pure real licorice root flavor. I like Panda brand for flavor too but not texture.

"For those of you out there that are new to gluten free foods...such as myself, the pasta experience will be quite disappointing.  Maybe it was just this particular brand...I don't know. Don't get me wrong...I love pasta and I consume it quite regularly. So when I suddenly switched to this new gluten free diet because you hear how much healthier it is, I thought I'll give it a try.<br /><br />First off, expect to cook the spaghetti longer then regular wheat pastas. The water will start to look thick and cakey. I suppose that's normal too. As you cook beware of the odor which I can't describe. The noodles will be very sticky so I advise putting in olive oil in the water but that didn't do the trick as well as I thought either. The noodles do have a heavier consistancy but as for the taste...it was just ok. It made me quite bloated after eating it. Wonder what that was about. Would I eat this again? No.",Buyers Beware...,2

The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening.

I used it on cold pasta and veggies, and bread and all four were delicious. Since I especially liked the basil I ordered the larger bottle. I'm not sure why the larger bottle had a bitter taste. I did use half basil and half a extra light olive oil when I served the samplers, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it or not. I'm going to try that and see if it works.  If it does I'll amend my review. If not then I'm afraid I'll have to stick with this one and won't be ordering it again.",Flavor not that great,2
"I tried the Rocky Road flavor and while it is not awful, it is nothing to rave over.  When something is described as a ""sinfully healthy snack"", I expect it to taste magical and leave me in awe that it only has 140 calories.  These small bars are not decadent or sinfully healthy.  They taste like unsweetened no-bake cookies to an extent and have a slight vitamin aftertaste that frequently accompanies protein and nutrition bars.  Inside the bar, I found a couple of nuts but everything else melded together and if it were a blind taste test, I would never guess them to be rocky road inspired.  Nutritionally, I don't think this bar is great.  For a small 140 calorie bar, it has a good deal of fat (8g) and sugar (9g).<br /><br />If you insist on trying these and they are out of stock here, you can get your halo bar fix on iherb.com.

"I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....","Good, as long as they are still fresh",2
"I don't expect the taste of home-made from a store-bought cookie - it's a naughty pleasure, and I expect a consistent chewiness and not-too-crumbly texture combined with sweetness and, when chocolate chips and nuts are involved, some pleasing chunks of crunchiness and bursts of chocolate flavor.  Well, Quaker Oats got the TEXTURE right...<br /><br />These cookies were a TOTAL disappointment.  There's just NO richness to them at ALL - the flavor is mostly a sort of mechanical reference to the taste of oatmeal in a real homemade cookie. Even when licking one of the chocolate chips directly, the chocolate taste just sort of briefly tantalizes then evaporates, and the nut-bits are too small to be noticeable.<br /><br />I won't be looking for these in stores!",Bland,2
"My entire extended family tried this stuff, and we all agreed: This tasted like concentrated Splenda (sucralose) and dish soap mixed into a glass of water.

This was like sweet tea made with chlorine instead of sugar.<br /><br />This will definitely help you if you're on a diet, because the flavor will put you off drinking anything for a while.

"I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the ""My K cup"" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang.",Taste is obviously subjective,2

"This is the only kind of Pepperidge Farm cookies that I have had in my lifetime that are just terrible. Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft.

"""M&uuml;esli"" is the diminutive of the German word for ""mush"", and as some of the favorable reviews declare, mushiness is the goal for M&uuml;esli-eaters. Authentic M&uuml;esli becomes mushy almost instantly when milk is added, though modern commercial Mueslis usually contain desiccated fruit and nut chips that stay gritty in the mush. And a lot of sugar to melt the mush together! If you've spent time in Germany or Switzerland, you'll know that you're expected to add fresh fruit and berries to your Mush, and to soften it with yoghurt or quark in preference to plain milk.<br /><br />The stuff is supposed to be wonderfully healthful, but if you compare the calories to various brands of granola, you'll find that both are higher than you thought, because of the sweeteners. Unsweetened oat bran flakes will get just as mushy almost as quickly, and you can be selective about your mix-ins.<br /><br />The 'Familia' brand dominates the supermarket shelves in most parts of the USA. If you've tried it and you like it, Mazel Tov! But don't buy M&uuml;esli in bulk or in six-packs! It gets stale and extra-tasteless on the shelf, even when the box is unopened. Honestly though, wouldn't you rather have a crisp buttery croissant or a stack of Swedish pancakes with lingon to start your day?",Mushy Granola,2
"Glucosamine was highly recommended by a number of friends who own older dogs.  After reviewing most of the glucosamine dog products offered through Amazon, I decided on this one.  The cardboard box containing the 20 lbs. of ""wafers"" (actually a dog bone) was tightly sealed with packing tape when it arrived.  When I turned the box over to find the correct side to open, I could hear the contents inside tumbling around.  Much to my displeasure, when I opened the box the ""wafers"" were just thrown inside... much like a bag of pretzels or chips.  The box was about 2/3s full... I will have to take their word that there was 20 lbs inside.  Approx. half of the ""wafers"" were broken or shredded.  It was so bad that when I emptied the ""wafers"" into a plastic container, I was able to fill a 16oz. paper cup with the dust/particles found at the bottom of the box. (and that did not include the broken pieces!)<br /><br />The shipper didn't wrap the ""wafers"" in a plastic bag.  The shipper didn't make any attempt to protect or bubble-wrap the contents.  I'm not in a position to report the effectiveness of the glucosamine; but I can tell you I am extremely disappointed in the way it was packaged and shipped.  If you plan to order any of Amazon's glucosamine products; I strongly urge you to check the way in which it will be packaged.  Thumbs down to Amazon for this product!!!",Horrible Packing,2

"I guess I'm in the minority, but I really didn't like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste. Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste. The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value. Overall, while they aren't inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I don't even think I'll bother with the rest of the box.","Overly Sweet, Flavorless",2

I'm Italian so I was thinking more along the lines of flatbread from Italy. Pretty gullible, right? Just because the product is called Tuscan flatbread, doesn't mean there is anything even remotely similar. My biggest gripe is the amount of sugar that is used. They are CRACKERS, not COOKIES! I couldn't get past the SWEET flavor. I spit it out. Why does everything have to have so much sugar?! We do have other taste buds in our mouth.

"I have to admit, it's nice that Petite Cuisine doesn't have the standard nasty canned cat food smell to it. It actually looks and smells decent, compared to the stuff I'm used to. It also has an overall healthier list of ingredients than most canned cat foods. Normally, that would add up to a five-star meal. The problem is, our cat won't eat the stuff! Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff!

"I was really rooting for this toy to work out, because my Frenchie Tobias loves playing with plastic bottles and he loves treats. The Tug a jug should be the perfect combo, right? The one I purchased had the rope, not the rubber thing. In theory, when you tip the toy treats should fall out relatively easily, according to various instructions and videos I found through internet searches. But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.<br /><br />He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.<br /><br />I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part.

"I love the taste of Bulls-Eye!  I found out that I was on my last bottle of the 'original'  - I like the other flavors as well - so I went by my local grocery, and I don't know why I looked on the ingredient list, but there at the top of the list, the main ingredient was High Fructose Corn Syrup!  I was shocked.  Didn't buy it of course, because besides the taste, I also love that I don't have to eat HFCS. I then checked the bottle I had at home.  Unbelievably, my older bottle had no HFCS in it at all.  So I'm savoring it for as long as I can until I can find a suitable replacement.  What genius at the company took a ridiculously fantastic product and decided to ruin it?!  Almost every BBQ sauce out there has HFCS in it, which is why I was so happy when I found Bull's-Eye.

"I'm not sure if I got one of the bad ones people have been talking about or not, but this bar tasted terrible. (Note: I didn't get it from Amazon, so this review has nothing to do with Amazon's distribution process, just the taste of this product.) I picked one up at the grocery store mostly because I was extremely curious how they have ""milk chocolate"" and ""peanut butter"" while also having ""0g sugar."" Peanuts have naturally occurring sugar in them (generally a few grams per serving), and milk chocolate usually contains large amounts of sugar as well (although it is not necessary by definition). Well, when I opened it there was a small amount of white powdery buildup on the outside of the bar, mostly on the vertical side of one end of the bar. I broke off a piece and the inside seemed a bit moist, which was reassuring. The bar is essentially a full solid (fairly thin) chocolate shell around a homogeneous filling of orange-colored peanut-smelling material. However, the bar tastes terrible. I got some cocoa flavors (_not_ chocolate) on the tongue to start, immediately followed by a very strange nutty flavor from the inside filling - I suppose it was peanuts, but wasn't clearly recognizable as such. What was recognizable, however, was the lack of sugar - it didn't taste even the slightest bit sweet. The aftertaste was extremely long (I had to get a drink to wash the taste out of my mouth after a while), and tasted bitter, sour, and a tiny bit salty. Not enjoyable at all.<br /><br />Again, others have been complaining that some bars taste significantly worse than others due to possible mis-handling during the shipping process, so your mileage may vary.",Terrible taste...,2

"I should start by saying that I eat the  Nugo Free Dark Chocolate Trail Mix bar daily, often twice a day.  A mini-meal with good protein that is edible and doesn't have soy is hard to find.

The ""carrot"" ""cake"" ""flavor"", though: teeth-rattlingly sweet, no carrot flavor that I could discern, and definitely a strange taste.  In short, not pleasurable.  I've eaten my share of gross protein bars, raw food bars, and other products, and so my tolerance for things that aren't really the texture or flavor that food should be is pretty high.  And I've certainly eaten worse.  But I've eaten better, and I actively like the Dark Chocolate Trail Mix flavor.

"The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as ""PB2"" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again).",Just know what you're getting,2

Trader Joes is constantly separated and quite thin to boot even in the fridge. It's still thin in the fridge. Highly recommend Justin's Almond Butter over Trader Joes any day of the week. I've tried most out there. Maranatha makes a nice one I've only found at Wegmans (forget the exact type as they have a few different ones), not to mention Costco sells a giant jar of Maranatha's regular almond butter for about $10. Has to be a 24oz or so jar. Sunland tastes as good as the Trader Joes and is much cheaper on here. So if you can get it locally for $5-6, great. Otherwise, don't waste your money.",Not worth it for the price (on Amazon),2
These coffee pods smell very strong when you first open them. however; preparing them as instructed (8 oz. water per pod) it comes out so translucent and weak.

"There were a number of things I did not like about this coffee.  First, while most coffee is packaged in 12 oz to 1lb bags, this one is only 11 oz.  That may not seem like much but to pay thier price and get an ounce less than their standard product, seems like a price increase to me.  Next was the actual coffee flavor.  I tried making this coffee a number of different ways to make it taste good.  And every time it just didn't work.  Now, trying to be fair, I like a lighter roast which Starbucks is not known for.  So for those of you who like a darker roast, you may like this just fine.  The last problem I had was the vanilla flavor.  It was extremely overpowering. Just for the record, my wife, who only drinks flavored coffee, did not like this one either.",Worst Vanilla coffee I have ever had,2

Affordable price and no leaks :)<br /><br />**Updated**<br /> Now that we are in full swing using these bags to defrost milk for Daycare I can give a better review. I have had 3 leaky bags out of about 100 which have been defrosted so far... there were no holes when I put the milk in but the 3 that have leaked seem to have come apart at the seems when frozen. I have about a months worth of milk frozen in them right now and I sure hope that there aren't more leaks... as a 3% failure rate isn't great. I will update again in another month as that will be another 140 bags we have defrosted.<br /><br />* Update 2* I freeze 8 bags a day - 6 oz of milk in each. I defrost 5 a day. Today 3 of my 5 which were left to thaw overnight were leaking. All were from different batches and all were leaking along the seams.

I've been through them all it seems, until I came across this one when reordering through Amazon recently.  Unfortunately, these missed the mark considerably. They are a poor match for the Senseo which tends to either pour water through them too fast or pool water in the pod around them, which results in coffee that resembles tea or colored water.  Don't know what to do with the three boxes I bought.  Maybe Amazon will take them back, or I can break them open and utilize them with my espresso machine? Nonetheless, I've spent enough time trying to find a worthwhile decaf pod; I'm now going to buy a Coffeeduck and allow myself to have a decent cup of coffee with my Senseo and a premium ground decaf of my choice and liking.",Not so good...,2

"When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!",The cats weren't impressed!,2

"I work for Heinz and bought this as a funny item to add to a gift bag for a co-worker; however, the packaging pictured here is not the same as what I received.  Pictured here, the name stands out and has a funny impact; the cans I received were slightly re-worded so the phrase ""spotted dick"" was lost in the middle of the phrase ""Taste of Home Delightful Spotted Dick Pudding"" with all words having the same size and style of font.  It's almost as if they deliberately wanted to remove the perhaps unintentional shock value the original packaging had.  Sadly, that's why I purchased it!",Packaging is not the same as pictured,2

"When i first opened the box it looked perfectly fine. the expiration date was april 2012 the bag seemed fine. That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it ""Canidae"" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip",Packaging was already open!!!,2
"I really wanted to like these dressings/marinades/rubs, but had to give upon them before I wasted a couple hundred in other ingredients trying to salvage the experiment.  Maybe they're good as rubs or marinades?  I made the various dressing mixes listed on the side of the bottles, but I didn't have the heart to put them on meat.<br /><br />I had two big problems:<br />1) All of the dressing recipes are super, super, super vinegary.  Even if you cut back on the vinegar, you're still left with super, super vinegary.  If you're from South Carolina, this might be your thing.  I'm not, it isn't.<br />2) They all smell and taste similar!  You know how every variety of Sam Adams tastes like, well... Sam Adams?  These mixes have the same issue.  If I had to guess, I'd say that ""herb blend"" that's the first ingredient on each bottle is the same blend - something proprietary that the makers spin off in different directions to make the different dressings.<br /><br />They are relatively healthy, without any scary fillers or sugar or whatnot, but Annie's, Wegman's and Brianna's make whole lines of relatively healthy dressings that actually taste good.  I'll be going back to those, or making my own herb mixes.",Disappointing,2

Once I smelled them, they hardly had a chance. I rinsed them for 2 minutes or more and then blanched as directed, and doused them with a Thai peanut dressing.

"Not being a food chemist, I'm not sure what the deal is here with vegan and vegetarian ""meats.""  I really like most veggie-based patties, ""chicken"" bits, and breakfast sausages.  However, the various ""brats"" that I so desperately want to grill are, for the most part, terrible.  And I don't just mean ""not meat-like.""  I mean, they don't taste very good.<br /><br />The food chemists at the famous Monell Chemical Senses Center have, as I remember, ""hamburger in a vial.""  That is, with your eyes closed, they can fool you into thinking there is a grilled hamburger in front of your face, when in reality it is a combination of chemicals they have isolated from this product.<br /><br />So how hard can it be to really simulate the flavor of bratwurst?<br /><br />In this case, it's jerky.  It kinda looks okay (needs more imperfections... lumps and bumps), has somewhat the same consistency (you gotta pull hard or break off a piece), and, as far as the ""original hickory pepper"" flavor, you can tell it has pepper.<br /><br />But that first bite made me think of those veggie brats.  Not a good association.<br /><br />I guess this just needs to be an acquired taste.  I do appreciate the effort... the vegan product, the non-GMO soy, and the low-fat (in this case, 0 grams of fat) product.<br /><br />But can't those Monell scientists work up a vial of ""jerky taste and smell?""<br /><br />I'll be waiting.",Concept?

Of course, this can be true of any pet food, even the expensive kind, but when it's that cheap, I question it.<br /><br />My cat, however, loved the flavor of this food.  She devoured it in no time.  She only gets a small amount in the mornings as a treat, but she loves it.  This is NOT a food I'd want my cat to live on.<br /><br />The food is pate style, but has a more gelatinous consistency than other pate styles from brands like Hills' Science Diet or even Purina.  My cat doesn't mind this texture, but if you're using this type of food to mix medicine or supplements into, it's a bit more difficult.<br /><br />There isn't a ton of gravy with this variety, but enough that it is very moist.  After refrigerating it, it solidifies quite a bit, so I add a little warm water to it and mix.<br /><br />The packaging opens easily and cleanly, which is nice.  You cannot reseal the container if you don't use it all at once, but I guess you could kind of pinch the sides of the foil top over the sides of the plastic tub for a day or so.

"I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part.

I have only recently discovered a love for Chai Tea but it could be only a certain brand. I really enjoy the Celestial Seasonings brand Chai which has more body and well-blended flavor. This had such a strong cinnamon flavor and it was more the oil-type not the cinnamon stick type. None of the other flavors stood out at all to me. I really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when I was a kid.

This stuff tastes more like dirt and hay than it does Mate! As for why the taste is off, it is difficult to say what is actually going on. It is entirely different from the traditional taste of Mate.

I toyed with the idea that it may be a bad batch, but I know that's not the case as I've bought two bags of this stuff and it's the same taste. The only obvious problem with this Mate is it being unsmoked. So if you are looking to buy that traditional tasting Mate, look elsewhere. And another problem, perhaps, is a simple issue of it not being aged long enough? I don't know. I've heard that two years is the ideal length of time, but really don't know much about the subject of aging Mate.

After receiving it today and making a sample cup of broth I have to say I'm really disappointed in it.<br /><br />First of all, there's no ""chicken"" in the ingredients at all.  The closest we have to anything animal is ""CSC shortening"" -- I don't know what that particular product is but much of the time shortenings are trans-fats which are extremely unhealthy for you.  The last ingredient listed is ""Other Spices"" which is often a codeword for MSG.<br /><br />Basically, as far as I can tell from the product list and taste of the final product this is a jar full of tumeric and celery and onion powder.  When you use it to make broth you end up with a substance that's the same color, opacity, and viscosity as orange juice and that tastes not at all of chicken broth.  It also has a film of semisolid granules floating at the top that have the consistency of those little orange fish eggs you sometimes find on sushi (my guess is that it's either the shortening or poorly dissolved celery powder) that would have to be skimmed off of any soup you made if you wanted people to actually eat it.<br /><br />The next two products I will try in my search for a low/no sodium chicken base is Herb Ox's Sodium Free Chicken Bullion (which potassium cholride as a substitute for salt and monoammonium glutamate as a sub for MSG, an imperfect solution to just leaving them out) and if that doesn't taste good then I'll probably end up with the ""low"" sodium Better Than Bullion chicken stock paste product, which I know at least tastes right even though it still has an awful lot of salt in there and is much more expensive than regular bullion.",Not what I hoped for,2

"I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.","Dog was a fan, but I wasn't",2
"I love the way this is packaged (other than, as others have noted, you need to keep the K-cups in a resealable bag, so they're not quite as convenient as traditional K-cups in terms of storage).

"This rub does indeed have low salt (compared to most meat rubs), but in order to achieve this the makers added heaps of celery.  The taste overwhelms this rub (I and the dear spouse both agree).

We much prefer low-salt rubs with added garlic instead.",Too much celery-- much too much too much,2

"This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else.",Blech,2

"I always buy the Dingo brand mini bones. My dog loves them. She gets one after dinner every night. I never let her have a rawhide bone unless someone is with her. My Vet told me that I should give my dog these instead because they help reduce plaque build up on the teeth. The Vet even gave us one of the larger size strips. My dog did enjoy it and had no problem chewing and swallowing it. I found these on Amazon at such a good price, I ordered a bag for medium dogs. After chewing on one for a short time she started swallowing a large piece, choking on it, throwing it up and then starting over again. I took most of it away from her, but she still had a small piece that seemed to be a bit stuck in her thought and it took her a while to get down.

Okay so my noodles came today and I was really excited to try them. I read good reviews and bad reviews..but I still wanted to try on my own. I opened the bag and just like the reviews it did have a fish smell...the smell wasn't as bad as I would've imagined..it's tolerable not as bad as a smell of after taking a dump. I washed them with cold water for about a minute..the smell was there a bit. Boiled them in hot water for around 5 minutes and the smell was kinda gone. So I put them in my already cooked meat sauce. Let it cook up for around 5 minutes. I tried just one little noodle...goodness..let's just say I didn't want to try again. The taste well it DOESN'T taste bad. The TEXTURE!!!!!! that's where the problem is....it just felt like I was eating a raw worm!..no I've never eaten a worm..but you know how soft warms are and imagine eating it and you feel that soft crunchiness...that's what I felt while eating it.

"This extra-bold decaf is one of the best tasting K-cup varieties, especially in the decaf space.  The price over time, however, is all over the place and buyers must be cautious.  More than a year ago, I began ordering this variety under Amazon's Subscribe and Save program at about $20 for a pack of two 24-count boxes.  Later, with no apparent rationale other than supply and demand, the price shot up to $38.  I immmediately started using other decaf K-cups.  During this time, I saw a listing that appeared identical to this Timothy's variety that I had been ordering at about $20, only to learn when it was delivered that it only included only ONE 24-count box and not two as before.  Effectively a 100% price increase!!  Nice try, but I quickly sent it back as misleading and not as described. Recently, the price came down again to about $23 for two boxes, although no longer available under Subscribe and Save.  Still, it is a great product so I placed orders over the past couple of months.  Now, after a couple of months, at the end of April 2011, the price has again risen to $38.  Is this a ""bait-and-switch"" tactic by Amazon or its supplier thinking that buyers won't notice the price increase?  The coffee deserves 4 to 5 stars but the misleading pricing brings my rating down to 2 stars.",Great coffee--pricing disaster,2
"Ginger isn't the kind of thing that I eat regularly, or in big doses when I do, but I like the flavor. After one sip of this drink mixture though, I think I'm good for the rest of the year. The thing is, I knew I was in for trouble as soon as I opened the packet and saw just how much power came out of it. You'd think that one packet is meant for an entire gallon and not just a little over one cup.<br /><br />Making the drink is simple- add the packet's contents to a cup, add hot water and drink it when you're ready. The smell is great, and I couldn't wait to try it out. Good god is the flavor bold. I only suggest buying this drink if you REALLY love ginger. I mean...if you go crazy like Taz when someone even mutters the word, then you will probably like this stuff. I could barely detect any hint of lemon, the other flavor featured, because the ginger sucker punches you in the mouth relentlessly. Take a big ginger root, blend it, and that's how this tastes.<br /><br />Even now, 5 hours after trying it out, I can still taste it. And this is after having eaten dinner and lots of water and milk.

These 16.9 oz bottles are even smaller than expected--each of the two is about the size of a premium soft drink bottle.  What was more disappointing was the lackluster taste and flavor impact of the oil itself: although smooth and light, it is nothing special.  Its use imparted no enhancing flavor when used to pop corn in an electric popcorn popper and certainly offered nothing special when used to toss a fresh salad with balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />This BetterBody Foods organic oil may indeed have been processed in an ultra-fabulous unique manner, but I discern no real taste difference from the grocery chain's 48oz bottle of Crisco-brand canola oil (bought on sale locally today for $2.99) with its own light taste, cholesterol-free rating, and trans-fat free purity.  Save your dollars: use more distinctive coconut oil for your corn popping [you likely will have fewer unpopped kernels than was the case with the steeply-priced BetterBody Food's organic canola oil] and buy your cold-processed canola oil in larger containers  having a more favorable price per ounce.",OK--but not good value or extrodinary taste,2

"I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed.

Comparison of the empty container with this new one showed no difference at all except for an adhesive label placed on the cover over the old one.

She kept apologizing, and was unable to explain to me why a correct description is not on the container; at this price, I would have appreciated a coupon toward the regular product at the pet store, since I have a 3/4 tub of the crumbly stuff that I can't use.

I don't agree that it would keep a person from being hungry or that it could be used as a meal.  Did I mention that the bar was tiny?<br /><br />Price.  These babies are expensive.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the couple of bites I was able to experience, the excess of carbs in each tiny bar and the expensive retail price will definitely keep me from buying more.<br /><br />Natalie S.",Too expensive and TOO small!!,2

"This is the third Tasty Bite entree I've tried and the first I've been truly disappointed in.  The picture on the box is very misleading as the actual product is much soupier with much less solid substance.  Also, the taste of salt completely overpowers the taste of the lentils.  I like the convienence of the packages and the nutrition so I'll probably try other Tasty Bite entrees - but not this one again!",soupy and salty,2
I am very disappointed in my last shipment of Kashi Go Lean Crunch.

"I liked just about all the Capri Suns up until a few years ago. For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet-like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health-wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available!

"I was surprised to see the package is small.  But since my dog eats the salmon and chicken dry dog food from the HALO brand for years, and he loves it, so I was going to give a try for the dog treats.  For some reason, he didn't want to eat it at all - probably it doesn't have a strong dog food/chicken smell?  But I'm sure they made it with good ingredients - I can see the oats in the biscuits.

"I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.","Dog was a fan, but I wasn't",2

I did get him to eat it, cause like I said, he's a champ...but it took FOREVER!! Then I put him down for a nap, and when I went in to get him, his whole room REEKED of garlic!

"I was very disappointed when my dog had the everlasting treat out within 5 minutes.  And when I put it back in and let it dry, he had already figured it out and popped it out in seconds.<br /><br />I think this is because it was too small for him.  It says for dogs ""under 40 lbs"", and my dog is a little shy of that mark.  The large looked really big and the product says that medium is good for under 40lbs... Apparently not though.  Since he could get his mouth around the edge of the toy, he could pop out the everlasting treat.<br /><br />Not sure it's a bad product, just maybe the wrong size.  But now I'm too scared of wasting $20 on the large in case that's a dud too.",Medium is too small for my 37 pound dog!,2
"I am by no means a coffee snob and I can usually handle coffee of lower quality but when I brewed a cup of this Hazelnut community coffee I had a lot of trouble drinking it. The aroma is almost predominantly hazelnut and the smell of coffee is a distant second. Visually the ground is extremely uneven with random chunks here and there. Now for the taste, as soon as I had my first mouthful the first thought in my mind was ""vegetables"". There is a strong green vegetable flavor to it that I find extremely unpleasant. A friend of mine found that mixing this coffee with another companies dark roast coffee before brewing helped alleviate this problem. I will not be purchasing from this company again especially with so many other great coffee choices out there.",undrinkable in my humble opinion,2
"I had been eying the Popchips brand for some time but I they seemed too expensive and I passed. So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors.

I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.

"Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.

When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?

"But this product had an after taste hard to describe. It was something on the order of a bitter, metallic taste. At first sip, the chocolate taste came through along with the coffee. Then this nasty after taste spoiled it. I regularly buy Wendy's Jamocha shake, add chocolate to my coffee, and like coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup. So its not the basic flavor that seems to be the fault. Possibly something is wrong with the container or the coffee is bitter.",I really like the chocolate-coffee combination,2

While it can verge on too sweet at times, depending on how hard you squeeze that bottle (thus the amount of syrup you get out of a single `serving'), this really does taste pretty darn good.  It's a nice way to add some flavor to a sodaless diet (something I've been trying hard to eliminate).  I wouldn't recommend drinking this all the time (LOL at all the facts pointing to it not being good for you, and the fact that it can clean your counters), and it's odd that the aftertaste (which clings to the back of your throat) doesn't really hit you until a few minutes after you're done drinking it, but it is pretty tasty and is a nice change of pace for a day, week, month that consists of water, water and more water.<br /><br />EDIT:  Wow, so as this day wore on that aftertaste clung to the back of my throat in the grossest of ways.

"PROS:<br />- Dog loves it, eats it up. Varying size snacks makes it a good fit for almost any size dog<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Not very ""beneful"" - anything with the top two ingredients being ""Ground yellow corn"" and ""chicken by-product meal"" is not nutritious. For those unfamiliar with ""chick by-product"" it is (according to wikipedia) ""rendered parts of poultry carcasses and can contain bones, offal (internal organs), undeveloped eggs"" and possibly feathers. And ground yellow corn is essentially just another non-nutritious filler.<br /><br />- Expensive. Obviously Purina is trying to market this dog food as a higher-end healthy product, but since it's actually not, and priced about the same as much healthier alternatives, it is incredibly expensive for something so cheap.

If anything it takes MORE time to prepare baby food with the Beaba simply because it has such a small capacity.  You can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer, which seems like a good amount of food.  However, by the time you steam and puree your food, you end up with only about half a cup of baby food, maybe a bit more.<br /><br />Let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes.  Always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy.  The Beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time.  I can cook four LARGE sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7-cup food processor all at once.  With the Beaba, start to finish, from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling, you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby.  Also, food coming out of the Beaba is EXTREMELY hot, rightly so, but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool, which just adds to your food prep time.<br /><br />Anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in BULK.  Most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the Beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time.  Just one hour  in the kitchen on Sunday and I had enough baby food to last all week, if not longer.  I have a KitchenAid 7-cup food processor which I found on sale at BB&B for around sixty bucks.  I would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave, then puree them quickly in the food processor, usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time.<br /><br />Also, one pot, one steamer basket, and one food processor was MUCH easier to clean than the Beaba.  The Beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time I used it and I didn't care for all the little parts and pieces I needed to clean on the Beaba.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers.  Gladware makes small 4-ounce containers.  I believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks.  I would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer.  Each night before I went to bed, I would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day.  Come mealtime, it was fast and easy to scoop out what I needed and warm it up in the microwave.<br /><br />After several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the Gladware containers would crack, but they're so affordable that I didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set.","Very small capacity, takes too long to use, hard to clean.",2
"Gloria Jean's is the cheap-o brand for the Keurig machine, and it shows.  They've got the honesty to say (on their regular 24-pod box) ""with the subtle taste of hazelnut.""  Boy, IS it subtle!  Not only is the flavoring weak, but the coffee itself isn't strong at the lowest (6 oz) setting and forget the 8 oz level; you might just as well be reusing pods.<br /><br />When we first got the Keurig, we got it with a selection of Green Mountain coffees.  I thought these were first-class but kind of pricey - you can get Gloria Jean's around here for about $.36 a pod.  This saves a fair amount if you go through 6-8 pods a day, but for the difference in quality, I just don't think it's worth worrying about.  If you have to have your coffee fix so you can get out the door, keep a couple boxes of Gloria Jean's around in case you run out of the good stuff, but don't use it regularly, or you'll find yourself giving up on your Keurig machine!","Well, You Can't Beat the Price!",2

"I think that this Liptons To Go Green Tea Mix tastes OK, but I prefer real tea. My wife likes this Lipton's Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix. She likes the mild strawberry flavor.<br /><br />But it is not as natural as Lipton advertises. Lipton's product info states, ""Lipton Tea & Honey ... is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it's made with real ingredients ... blended with honey and strawberry and acai flavors ... Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors ... flavor with other natural flavor ... and no aspartame.""<br /><br />So what's there to not like about that? Well it's not all real ingredients and sweetened with just honey. The fine print discloses that it includes Sucralose (sweetener). Shane Ellison calls himself ""The People's Chemist"" and is the author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402225059"">Over the Counter Natural Cures: Take Charge of Your Health in 30 Days with 10 Lifesaving Supplements for under $10</a>. Shane was a big pharma chemist who quit when he discovered that the drugs that he was creating for the big pharma companies were nothing more than toxins and the real cures were natural and didn't require a prescription. Shane says that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose (Splenda) have serious problems. Studies show that they lead to weight gain and even pre-diabetes. Artificial sweeteners ""disrupt the body's natural calorie counter"" and ""put the users at much higher risk for being obese and insulin resistant."" Shane says that Sucralose, 1,6-Dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-'-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-'-D-galactopyranoside, contains a historically deadly, nasty form of chlorine (RNFOC), which yields poisons such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides. ""An RNFOC can invade every nook and cranny of the body ... and may result in weakened immune function, irregular heartbeat, agitation, shortness of breath, skin rashes, headaches, liver and kidney damage, birth defects, and cancer. Hiding its origin, sucralose pushers assert that it is 'made from sugar'. Sucralose is as close to sugar as glass cleaner is to purified water. France recently banned such false advertising statements. The deceit has been ignored within the United States.""<br /><br />Why does the FDA allow this? Shane says science was sold out for profit. ""Just like chemists manipulate the properties of matter, Big Pharma manipulates studies using 'checkbook science.' This allows them to pay for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. Checkbook science isn't illegal by FDA standards. It's been going on for over 20 years. Known as the Bayh-Dole Act, US law was amended in 1980 to permit flagrant conflicts of interest, ones that allow the industry to design drug trials and hire experts to conjure up favorable results at will.""<br /><br />So if you want something natural, look for Shane Ellison's book and skip this Lipton's tea mix.",It's not as natural as Lipton advertises,2

"As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample.  It tastes good and it claims to contain ""nothing cooked, nothing processed,"" but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains ""agave nectar"" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a ""healthy alternative"" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this ""raw"" bar, and second, they used ""agave nectar"" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used ""agave nectar"" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.<br /><br />You can research for yourself, google ""agave nectar bad""<br /><br />and look for entries from ""foodrenegade,"" ""nourishedkitchen"" and ""living-foods""<br /><br />You can also google ""fructose bad""<br /><br />check out the hits from ""about"" and ""the american journal of clinical nutrition""<br /><br />Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you're in, ""agave nectar"" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims ""nothing cooked and nothing processed"" is nothing short of fraud.",small bar for a high price with an untrue claim and hidden fructose,2
"As a marathoner, century cyclist, and half-ironman triathlete, I've used my fair share of sports mixes.  I've been a faithful Cytomax user for several years and find that it helps me feel less sore after hard training and is easy on my stomach.  However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes ""Stevia"".  Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product.  The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and ""messed with"" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness.  It's safety has also been debated, and given the large quantities of sports drink that I consume, that's enough for me to switch products.",Great until they added Stevia,2

Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers.

It's a pretty strong odor but it wasn't overpowering.<br /><br />Since I am not familiar with some of the grains in the bag, I thought maybe they have some distinct odors that are similar to what I assume is a stale smell. For reference, I know the smell of flax seed, oats, and rice, and they smell nothing like what I was smelling from this bag.  Despite the strange smell, I still tried a few bites, and the taste wasn't too bad but I KNOW it would have been better without that lingering smell.<br /><br />Just like the others who have complained, the expiration date on my bag is August 29, 2012, so the product should have still been good.<br /><br />Also, like others, I felt that there really weren't many clusters as the picture on the product shows.

"When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole ""greenwashing"" thing needs to be regulated better.

"In reading all the reviews of different decaf k-cups, the opinion I came away with was that Tully's was where I should go to get a really bold, dark roasted flavor similar to Starbucks' coffee. It does get closer to Starbucks than any of the other decaf k-cups I have tried. But in a way it goes too far and results in a somewhat strange and overpowering taste.<br /><br />I had tried Timothy's decaf and Newman's Own decaf, with the latter vastly superior to the former. I would say Tully's beats Timothy's (which is just brown water), but probably not Newman's. I also tried Donut Shop decaf simultaneously with Tully's (I had Donut Shop at work and Tully's at home). For the first few days, I thought Donut Shop was a little weak and I liked Tully's better for its bolder flavor. But after a couple of weeks I grew tired and a little sick of Tully's strong taste - it's not just strong like a normal cup of Starbucks, it's strong almost like they added some kind of artificial chemical to it to make it taste darker or more burned than it really is. After one month I was long done with the Donut Shop and was just slowly getting through the Tully's (diluted with lots of milk).<br /><br />When I reordered, I only considered Newman's or Donut Shop. I couldn't bring myself to drink another cup of Tully's. It's a shame because they definitely took a step in the right direction with their stronger flavor, but it was a misstep that makes the coffee a poor choice for long-term consumption.<br /><br />Perhaps a good strategy for a newcomer would be to order Tully's AND another brand or two like Newman's and Donut Shop, and trade off which one they drink.

"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one.

"BAAR Cola Syrup at least TASTES good. I agree with my fellow reviewers who say it tastes good. It's exactly like coca-cola in flavour, except that it's not quite as sweet.  (And thus, doesn't even approach Pepsi-Cola in intensity of sweetness.)  No matter -- I just add a few packets of my own favourite artificial sweetener....<br /><br />This syrup, however, lists ""High Fructose Corn Syrup and/or Sucrose"" as its first ingredient.  Sucrose is another word for sugar....bad enough, but at least it's been used for thousands and thousands of years, and most people, throughout history, who have imbibed sucrose/sugar, have lead relatively normal,(and normal-length), lives.  But High Fructose Corn Syrup, though also natural, is a somewhat modern invention.  Thus, the claim above the name, ""Cola Syrup"", right in the middle of the front of the label, (that this is an ""Old Fashioned Remedy"") is patently false.<br />(H.F. Corn Syrup was first -- unsuccessfully -- produced in 1957, and then sucessfully mass-produced and introduced into foods in 1975.)  Even if you are born in 2010, anything that has been around in foods for only 35 years, (since 1975), can hardly be called ""old-fashioned""!  Also, the listing of TWO ingredients, (""High-Fructose Corn Syrup AND / OR Sucrose""), as the possible number one, (largest amount) ingredient, is misleading, confusing, and (almost?) a violation of the law which mandates ingredients in food be listed in descending order of their amounts.  Are these ""And/Or"" ingredients listed alphabetically?  In order of how many bottles have HFCS, and how many have sucrose?  And how does one know, (if one is not a celebrity and is possibly being given the bottle for advertisement purposes), if the bottle one has purchased have the HFCS or the Sucrose?<br /><br />It is also totally astonishing to me that, according to the bottle, this product's manufacturer, BAAR, is the official supplier of Edgar Cayce Products!  The insignia of ""Cayce Care"" is, indeed, on this label!  And although the insignia is quite pretty, (a gold-outlined, white, horizontal oval, with a pretty little maple-leaf between the words ""Cayce"" and ""Care""), I simply<br />CANNOT believe that those who presently run the ""Edgar Cayce Foundation"" would ever condone the use of high-fructose corn syrup<br />in any of their products!  (Edgar Cayce himself probably never<br />heard of H.F.C.S, as he himself died in 1945.  Of course, Mr. Cayce is justly famous for his predictions of the future, (which he found whilst sleeping) -- but I am quite certain, (after reading up on H.F.C.S., on Wikipedia and elsewhere), that if Mr.<br />Cayce ever DID dream of H.F.C.S., he probably put it in the ""nightmare"" classification, and tried to forget all about it as much, and as soon, as possible!  In his place, I know that's what I would have done!)  To find high-fructose corn syrup in an Edgar Cayce Product is totally beyond belief. For myself, I will continue to admire, and research the modest, but completely genuine and gifted genuis who was Edgar Cayce -- but I will get my cola syrup elsewhere!<br /><br />And, where elsewhere?  From SodaSteam Soda Mix!  Slightly more expensive than this ""Baar"" Cola Syrup, it gives one: 1) A much, much thicker syrup, but the same 16 ounce size  2) Sweetening with SPLENDA.  Many people are down on Splenda, but it has been cited as the safest of the artificial sweeteners by David Zinczenko, of the ""Eat This -- Not That"" series of books.  Too much of anything is not good, of course, (I found that using too much Splenda gave me, personally, elevated readings on my liver tests....so I cut down) -- but from all I've read, Splenda is better than High-Fructose Corn Syrup, by a couple of miles!<br /><br />So, it's SodaStream Soda Mix Cola flavour for me.  If I find a healthier alternative than that, I will switch, (and hopefully be able to share my discoveries in an Amazon review).  But, as of now, I don't think I will buy BAAR Cola Syrup, (Old-Fashioned Remedy....?????), thin, watery, and most probably laced with High-Fructose Corn Syrup, ever again!<br /><br />Near the bottom of the front of the label, it proclaims that this cola syrup, ""Soothes Stomach Upset"".  But knowing I know now, this effect is, for my stomach, very, very temporary, at best.  H.F.C.S. -- ""High-Fake-Customer-Switcheroo"" syrup, is not something that I recommmend....for anyone!",A S......T H E......S T O M A C H......T U R N S............,2

Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer!

"First: I wanted to like these cookies.  I really did.  The concept is good, they look awesome on the outside of the package.  I like the regular chewy Chips Ahoy (like them, not love them) so I figured the addition of more chocolate would be a plus.<br /><br />Before opening the package, I checked the ingredients.  To my VERY pleasant surprise, no HFCS, but real sugar.  Doesn't say cane or beet, so I'll probably never know, but it isn't HFCS.  I'm sensitive to HFCS, so this was a BIG positive for me - and the only reason the cookies got two stars instead of one.<br /><br />Now for the bad:  The cookies are small.  A little smaller than standard crispy Chips Ahoy.  That's not a bad thing, except a serving is two cookies and that serving comes to 150 calories.  For the calorie content of approximately 3 cookies, I could've had a Snickers bar (or similar) - and I would have been happier.<br /><br />Finally, to touch on the title of my review: I hope I got a bad batch.  These cookies were awful. They tasted like plastic.  I'm not talking about a plastic texture, but taste.  They honestly tasted like melting/burnt plastic.  My wife tried one and noticed the same thing (without any coaching from me).  I'd love to try another batch, in hopes of having received defective cookies, but I'm not going to take the chance.<br /><br />If you're considering buying a pre-packaged cookie, stick with the standard Chips Ahoy varieties - crispy or chewy.  But stay away from these.",I hope I got a bad batch...,2
"The question about any product is always, Is it worth it's price? Here, no.

Also, in the window that I had placed the planter to grow, was an influx of flying insects that were not there prior to the introduction of the planter.

"This is the first catnip I've bought.  It seemed the best bang for the buck at the time of purchase, especially considering the top rated brand was 1/3 the amount for the same price.  I've used it in toys, rubbed it between my fingers as the package directs, etc.; yet our three month old kitten just doesn't seem to care.  She'll ""usually"" come up and take a whiff when I open the bag or coax her to see what I've got in my hand, but she quickly loses interest.  And it never manages to put her into some euphoric state, much less even settle her down, when she's running around, going crazy, as growing, restless housecats do.<br /><br />The catnip smells mostly like ground tea leaves, to me.  The only praise I can offer regards the volume that comes in the package compared to most other offerings on amazon, and that it comes in a resealable bag - not a ""ziplock"" bag like another reviewer indicated; it's clearly a professionally packaged product, but one with a ziplock style closure.  And, as others have noted, the bag is 3oz NOT 3.5 as amazon's title erroneously misadvertises.  Even so, it's still the best value on amazon, assuming it works as well as the other, more expensive, brands.  Considering all but maybe the most expensive has received mixed reviews of effectiveness, and that the best rated/most expensive option appears to be charging more for a tin can, I'm reluctant to invest more in a product that may only be effective for certain cats, if indeed it's not another form of snake oil.  Maybe I should have done my usual research beforehand.<br /><br />Update:  Having put this in several toys, a cardboard scratching pad and even sprinkled a little on her food once or twice per week, our kitten not only shows disinterest in this product now, but practically runs away when I open the bag as if the smell actually offends her.  We have three large, cat-eating dogs outside, which we rescued her from right after they got two of her siblings - they had wondered into the dogs radio fence boundaries and got trapped inside a tractor - so she has to stay indoors.  I was really hoping this might settle her down when she gets stir crazy.  But it doesn't, not in the least.",You get what you pay for?  Or is catnip tantamount to snake oil?,2

"I should have looked that the label more closely before purchasing this mayonnaise at my local grocery store.  However, when I saw it sitting there on it's shelf I immediately thought, ""Bacon + Mayonnaise = Perfection!""  The big problem is that there is NO bacon in this product (the label even says that this spread is suitable for vegetarians).  Bacon flavor? Kind of.  The smell reminds me of the bacon flavored dog treats that I give to my little hounds and then rush to wash the smell off of my hands.  Not a pleasant association.<br /><br />The mayonnaise itself is a little thick and heavy.  I often make my own using fresh egg yolks, safflower oil, lemon juice and a little white pepper.  This has a very strong Liquid Smoke flavor to it which I find off-putting.  I can't help but wonder, why didn't they just put real bacon in this product?  I would gladly pay more if it was the real thing.  There is a product on the market called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWV5Z4"">Bacon Jam</a> and they get close to 20 bucks for a 7 ounce jar and people can't get enough of it.

"I'm a big tea drinker.  I grew up in a tea drinking home- my grandmother always seemed to have a pot on the stove.  But all teas are clearly not equal.  And this is one of my least favorite black teas that I've had.  I thought that Chinese Breakfast sounded delicious, but I've noticed strong grassy notes.  At first I thought it was the milk we get.  We drink grass-fed milk for our daughters (Farmer's Creamery) that tastes amazing.  I thought we had gotten a batch of particularly grassy milk- but nope.  The Numi Chinese Breakfast tastes very grassy by itself, and it smells fairly unpleasant.  I'd say like a barnyard.  I don't mind the smell of a barnyard, I just don't want that of my tea.  I've tried most other Numi teas, like the Golden Chai (which is a spiced Assam) and the Honeybush, and they are , admittedly better.  They are about the quality of, say, Tazo.  That's to say they are not much better than regular black tea bags like Lipton or P.G. Tips.  And compared to Two Leaves and a Bud (delicious!) or even Lipton Black Pearl, Numi is not nearly as enjoyable.  That is especially true of the Chinese Breakfast.  I have 36 Chinese breakfast teabags and I will drink it all. I just won't be buying any more after that.",Smells like a barnyard,2

"I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the ""light roast"" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup. Even using two k-cups didn't help much. It's way too light for my tastes; glad I didn't buy the box of 88 at Costco.<br /><br />So, if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee, you'd like this. The flavor is good. But, k-cups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me.<br /><br />Amazon did ship fast and had a good price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Some reviews here don't seem to understand the terms being used.<br /><br />""Light Roast"" is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted. Light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times, but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor.  It does produce a `lighter' cup of coffee.<br /><br />""Extra Bold"" is a term Keurig/Green Mountain uses to describe a K-cup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal K-cups.  More coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee. The strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew.<br /><br />You can have a ""light roast"" coffee in an ""Extra Bold"" K-cup, but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I like a medium roast; a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite.",Very Light,2

"I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 ""magical"" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.",Not the best for your cat's long term health,2
"OK, first lets start with the packaging. Forget about actually being able to pull the two sides apart at the top of the bag to get it open and just get the sissors out of the misc. drawer and cut the top off. Then of course it doesn't seal very well by rolling the bag down and bending the ends of the wire over that's stuck to the bag. There is no way to get anything even close to a seal. So before opening try to find something to put the coffee in after you get the bag open. I used an empty Ovaltine jar, (the Ovaltine would have made better coffee than this does).<br /><br />  When I opened the bag of coffee it had a distinct burnt smell to it with just a faint hint of vanilla hiding in it. It smelled the same as it was brewing in my drip coffee maker. From other flavored coffee's that I've tried I've got used to cutting it 2 scoops of flavored coffee to one of Folgers. This time I used some of the French Roast Folgers. Which was a waist of a scoop of good Folgers coffee. The directions on the bag says to use two level teaspoons of it for every 6 oz. of cold fresh water. I cant even imagine trying to drink a cup as strong as it would be brewed to those directions.<br /><br />  I've tried this coffee with just a little sugar the way that I usually like my coffee and it wasn't drinkable. I tried it with a little chocolate flavored creamer, then a lot of sugar and a lot of chocolate flavored creamer and it still wasn't drinkable. I would really like to have a nice cup of vanilla flavored coffee, but I'm not going to get one from this. No matter what I have tried with it, it still tastes burnt. I even tried it with some French Vanilla flavored creamer and it still tastes burnt.<br /><br />  I would really like to be able to say something positive about this coffee but I cant. I tried to brew a pot in my new;<br />  BUNN HG Phase Brew 8-Cup Home Brewer - even the Bunn coffee maker couldn't get a decent tasting cup of coffee from this, and it makes the best coffee I've ever had.<br />  Maybe this bag came from a bad batch that got burnt by being roasted too long. Maybe what ever puts the vanilla flavoring in it was almost out and it didn't get enough or as much as it was supposed to get. From all the other positive reviews I must have got a bad bag or maybe its because I was a heavy smoker for over 30 yrs before I quit smoking 3 yrs ago and I still have damaged taste buds. Something was causing this to produce undrinkable coffee and if it wasn't the coffee then it has to be something else making it taste bad. Unless you like coffee that tastes burnt don't waist your money on this.",Not really my kind of coffee.,2

"I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock.

I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims. X-Sticks are less dry, far less greasy, and more tender to chew.",Slim Jims have nothing on X-Sticks,2
I tried this since I love bacon everything. I found it to have this odd after taste that gets worse every time you eat more of it.

"I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.",Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!,2

"I am both an avid tea drinker and sort of a manic coffee person.  I have definite likes and dislikes when it comes to both tea and coffee.  This beverage sort of fits into a ""no man's land"" when it comes to either.  I tried it as espresso (as the name suggests) and ended up with a murky,thick, sludge like drink that was anything ""but"" espresso.  Next, I tried it as a tea in the finest mesh strainer that I have, same results... terrible.  I tried it hot, I tried it cold.  It was like trying to make a beverage with the fine grit left at the bottom of my vacuum cleaner bag and had about the same appeal.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because rooibos is chocked full of health benefits and it is 'supposed' to be good for you.  That presupposes that you can stand to drink it.  I can't.  Rooibos tea is available in blends from major tea outlets such as TEVANA and I have tried it from other sources with no difficulty in preparation or loss of flavor.  It is not the rooibos that I object to, it is the way this manufacturer chooses to process it and way you will have to scramble to find a way to fix it that you can at least drink it.<br /><br />There are too many enjoyable flavors of tea and coffee for me to sample without all the irritation and drama that this product causes me to go through.<br /><br />I was not in any way happy that they chose to call it ""espresso"" as it is far from it.  It is as a matter of fact far from anything that I want to experience again.  Go buy some rooibos tea or espresso and enjoy them.  This is a failed experiment and a terribly misleading product in my opinion.",This drink doesn't fit in either category.,2

"So I have terrible anxiety and stress issues. My friends are always telling me I should smoke weed lol. However, I'm not a smoker and I'm a professional so that option isn't available to me. I decided to try some hemp products to see if they helped any.<br /><br />This hemp protein is a big NO from me. What I have been doing is adding it into my protein shakes. I add a scoop of protein and a scoop of the hemp, then blend it with milk in my Magic Bullet.<br /><br />The problem with this stuff in shakes is that it has the consistency of sand. Literally, it tastes like sand in your mouth. Also, immediately after I make a shake, I mean immediately, all the hemp sinks to the bottom. So I end up drinking the shake and by the time I'm done there's a quarter inch of hemp-sand at the bottom of my cup with very little ingested by me. I have to literally spoon it out or pour water in, shake it up, then drink it real quick.<br /><br />So this product was a waste for me. No way would I ever buy this again. It is terrible in shakes. Maybe if someone wanted to add it to their food or add it to something they are baking, like cookies or brownies, it could possibly work but it's of no use to me. Also, the first product I tried was hemp oil vitamins and they really gave me a boost in my spirits and with more energy. With this stuff, I feel I'm not getting any of the benefits like I did with the vitamins. This stuff was a waste of money for me. I will use this bag and that's it.<br /><br />Also, the packaging is terrible. After you cut open the bag, you basically have to put it into a container. I used a pitcher lol. They should at least make the bag resealable with with a zip-lock.<br /><br />If you want to try a great supplement form of hemp for health reasons, I would recommend these which worked immediately:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00119TL2W"">Hemp Seed Oil 1000mg - 60 - Capsule</a>",Tastes like sand and settles to the bottom like sand.,2

We went to five and all that happened is that it got sweeter. Yes, it has a slight pumpkin flavor, but for the most part it doesn't measure up.",If you like sugar and water...,2

"My dog eats Merrick food, and I thought it would be more convenient to start ordering it from Amazon in cases instead of hauling it home from the pet store every few days. Plus, it's a couple of dollars cheaper to buy it here versus at my neighborhood store. Unfortunately, though, the case of cans didn't survive shipping well at all--of the 12 cans, 4 were so severely dented that I don't think it's safe to feed their contents to my dog. I'm not talking about a little indentation at the rim, either--they were totally crunched and bent, completely trashed. I have no idea whether this was because the cans were too delicate, whether the Amazon box wasn't properly cushioned, or whether the package was abused in shipping, but I have noticed that even when I buy this brand at the pet store, I have to check really carefully to make sure that the cans are in good condition. Whatever the reason, this shouldn't happen, especially for a pricey brand like this--when cans get dented, it can let in air and bacteria that can spoil the food and make your dog sick. Given that 1/3 of what I bought was unusable, I ended up paying roughly $28 for 8 cans of dog food. That's way, way more expensive than supporting my local pet store. If these cans don't survive transport very well, it makes a lot more sense to me to buy them locally, when I can avoid the bad cans.<br /><br />Shipping headaches aside, however, I do recommend the food itself. My dog is a picky eater, but she seems to enjoy Merrick products well enough. They are made of high quality ingredients, and even though she has a sensitive stomach, they don't give her any trouble. I just wish that they'd pack the stuff in a container that could survive the transport to my house!",1/3 of the cans were too dented to use--this product does not ship well at all!,2

"In deciding to buy this item, I read the other reviews and expected a few dented cans.  Yet, I wasn't prepared for what I got.  10 out of the 12 cans were seriously, seriously dented.  I do fully understand that this does not affect the food's safety or nutritional value, but really!  We all know that crushed pages and a torn cover do not affect a book's readability, yet Amazon would not be in business today if they applied the same care in storing and shipping to their books as they do to their canned food goods.  All supermarkets that don't have an on-site cannery deal with shipped cans, and storing cans. Amazon may be entering a retail sector that it cannot so far handle.<br />I just have to point out that even though it may have been easier to buy these off Amazon, it is certainly not cheaper (even with the subscription discount - BTW, I cancelled my subscription after unpacking the cans).  For in fact, they were so dented that no brick & mortar supermarket would think to sell these at anything more than half-off the price.  To see the amount of denting, I uploaded a photo to the product description page.<br />In terms of the product itself, it's something I've loved for a long time.  Just buy a single can of it at a grocery store and try it before buying the 12-pack.  Make sense?",Great product.  Surprisingly dented cans not good.,2

As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).

However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes ""Stevia"".  Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product.  The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and ""messed with"" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness.

What we get instead is a mediocre Dijon-style mustard spiced up with ""hot pepper extract"".  This is a commercial additive of pure (or close to pure) capsicum, which is used for riot control and to add heat to an otherwise bland product.

By that I mean that I would get a french vanilla and a french vanilla decaf.  So, there were at least 5 flavors that I got with a decaf of the same flavor.  My biggest issue with these is the expiration dates.  My K-Cups had expiration dates ranging from 3 months ago to 1/2013.  In fact, my batch had 5 expired K-Cups.  The expiration dates for them were early February, so that's not even close to being good.  I wasn't too happy to find that 10% of my order was expired.

"Honestly, this was the worst tasting coffee I've had in a while.  It had a bitter almost chemical aftertaste that I could not ignore.  It really tasted like it had been sitting under an engine exhaust somewhere,  SO AWFUL we dumped out every pot we brewed.  We normally drink Equal Exchange brand and I thought I would take my chances on this due to the reviews so I could have an evening coffee.  I still gave it two stars because I think any company that goes through the process of keeping their product organic, water processed and remotely fair trade deserves kudos.<br /><br />I think the main reason I didn't like it is because I normally like lighter roasts such as Columbian, and this is a dark roast.  The lighter the roast, the higher the caffeine content.  The darker, the lower the caffeine.  So both my husband and I have stayed with and have refined tastes for the lighter side of coffee when it comes to roasts.  I occassionally like dark roasts so I thought it might be a shoo-in.  Unfortunately, I got six bags of this with high hopes and since then I have been having to give it away to random people hoping they will like it.  Especially those I know that like darker roasts flavor.<br /><br />I am going to try either Equal Exchange's decaf or Jim's Organic ""Together"" decaf on vitacost next time.  So far, the only decaf I like is the Safeway brand 100% Columbian decaf but we have decided after much research on how coffee is processed that ORGANIC is the only way to go.  We grind our own coffee, use an aeropress, use raw local milk along with rapunzel sugar.  Best coffee in the world!

"I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this ""Real Theater"" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is ""bad"" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of ""real"" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be ""artificial"" and ""thick"".  ""Thick"", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent ""real theaters"" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste.",Not so good,2

Well it had been a few years since I had eaten them and decided to try the Original again and the Loaded flavor which is a new addition. What happened? Ever since Betty Crocker changed the packaging and cooking directions on their products the quality and taste has gone down hill. I'm seeing it across the board: complaints about the cake mixes, tuna and hamburger helpers, and now the instant potatoes. I tried making the Original potatoes 4 different times, trying to figure out the right ratio of water milk and butter, and each time the bits of parsley were like hard little bumps in the potatoes. They used to be soft and meld in with the potatoes. Couldn't get the mixture to the right consistency. The Loaded variety has a faint salty cheese taste. That's it.

"Given that I liked this brand's granola so much, I anticipated finding this bars delicious as well.  Quite honestly I was underwhelmed by their flavor.  They don't taste bad -- and there is a nice, subtle cherry flavor -- but overall it just tasted like a slightly sweet flour-based bar.<br /><br />When I eat a bar like this, I'm generally looking for a decent protein content.  Unfortunately these bars (like this brand's granola) get almost all of their calories from fat and carbohydrates.  Each bar has only 4 grams of protein.  If I'm going to eat a low protein snack, I want it to be something more delicious than this.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this bar, however, is the addition of chicory root to bring up the fiber content.  Each bar contains 6 grams of fiber -- nearly 25% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  This could be a great thing for people who ordinarily don't eat whole foods, but if your diet regularly contains whole wheat, brown rice, and fruits and vegetables that contain fiber, then getting 25% of your daily fiber in a bar like this is only going to cause intestinal discomfort.",not particularly interesting...don't like the added chicory root,2

"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.","Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me",2

Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. First of all, I could not believe how sweet this was! I could practically feel my teeth rotting away, and though it only has one more gram than the ""O"" cereal (11 grams to O's 10), it was far sweeter. Adding to the con list is that this particular cereal uses high fructose corn syrup in addition to sugar and honey and has next to no fiber at all (less than 1 gram according to the box). As for the pros, you can definitely taste the honey and hint of nut and it stays crunchy for a while. Yes, it has some vitamins and minerals, but on the whole, I will never get this again and can only eat it mixed with an unsweetened cereal. Since <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28"">Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut, 14.1-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> is basically a waste of calories, I cannot recommend this unless you want a ""dessert"" cereal.",Sugar Shock,2

"Got this as a Christmas gift as I put it on my wish list. Looked pretty good. Within the price range of family.<br />However, I am used to buying premium tea from other sources. And now I know why and why I will continue to do so.<br />I was first shocked to find that the tea was in shards, crumbled pieces. This takes it down a notch for experienced, premium tea drinkers. It makes one think we're getting the leftovers of the higher grade harvests. When infused, the leaves maintain a flat, crumbled shape, they don't unfold into beautiful leaf structures. I believe this hinders the flavor of the infusion.<br />The flavor? The madarin is very nice. A pleasant, citrus flavor, subtle, delicate. However, it's difficult to detect a very noticable white tea flavor. Contrary to popular opinion, white tea does indeed carry a sweet soft tea flavor. In some ways the citrus notes overpower the tea flavor. Perhaps this is to cover up a lower grade white tea harvest.<br />It's not horrible, just disappointing. But, you get what you pay for and three tins at the price offered, you'll get a lot of cups of tea, just not the best quality. BTW, you can infuse this tea more than once, but if you want to save it in another container in the refrigerator for the next infusion, be prepared to have to scrape it out of the tea strainer because it infuses flat against the screen.",Crumbly tea!

I used it in May to make his birthday cake, luckily he wanted a ""stealth bomber that blended with the sky"" (he's very particular with his demands, I try to please) which required most of the cake to be sky blue.  These colors will give you nice pastels, but if you are looking for a very rich color, you will not get it from this product, no matter how much color you use.  The cake came out great, and I used the red to do the lettering which came out a nice darkish magenta, and was pleased with the kit in general.

"I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. It also doesn't have any breath freshening ingredients. I think the only reason why they are ""dental"" treats is because they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. These are MUCH better than the pounce soft and chewy varieties or any soft and chewy treat that can stick to cat teeth and cause bad breath and tooth decay. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have many beneficial dental ingredients either, but they are another pretty good one as they too contain vitamins but with a little bit of added breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. This treat my not help teeth, but they definitely won't hurt them. Also there are vitamins in these, which is pretty cool.

First off; I love Pop Secret Homestyle butter popcorn. To me it's as close to movie theater buttered popcorn I've ever found.  Still; I keep a look-out for new ideas like this one.  The 'bowl' idea appealed to me.  Sadly; the design failed to open properly and I had to cut it open.  The popcorn inside was buttery but mediocre in flavor.  Definately; not my Pop Secret Homestyle!  I'm sorry this didn't work out for me.  Somebody will like it though.  Different strokes for different folks; that what my dear Dad has always told his children.

"I'm a pretty big cereal and granola fan.  You'd have to botch up pretty badly to make me not like your cereal - Kind Healthy Grains has botched up pretty badly.

I really didn't detect a blueberry taste to it, nor did I see any actual dried blueberries in there.  The vanilla taste was a little artificial tasting, but I kept eating anyways.  Then the weird flavor started kicking in.  The vanilla taste started tasting more and more nappy tasting, and when I stopped eating for a little bit, I got the worse aftertaste in my mouth.  I'm presuming it was from the flax seeds, but having eaten flax seeds in a lot of cereals and from the fresh flax I put in my yogurt, I'm not sure if that was the cause of the problem.

I ordered this K-Cup coffee on the favorable reviews of others.  But  - taste is subjective and this particular flavor of coffee has not made any impression on me.

"I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this.","Strong Branding, Weak Flavor",2

The nut snack is good (albeit a bit spicy), the chocolate was chalky and white (inedible), the crackers are ok and the hummus is ok.  I never eat the edamame because I don't like the roasted ones.  The main reason for my negative review is that the last 6 pack I bought had an expiration date of 10 days after the date it was delivered -- totally unacceptable.  Also, one of the 6 boxes was missing the crackers.  I'll figure something else out for my at work snacks.",Watch the expiration dates!,2

The foliage achieved on the tree in the image is 2 to 3 times what you get. My tree is the size of a large piece of broccoli, with a small crown, it stands no more than 2 inches high.

"I must say I was excited to try this product because it sounded like a unique and tasty combination of flavors, but it didn't quite live up to what I had hoped for.  I enjoy the flavor of ginger as well as lemon by themselves but had never put the two together, although it makes sense if it's made right because they can balance each other with the right combination of quantities, a mix of bitter, sweet and sour.  The flavor of the ginger in this instance definitely over-powered the lemon and was just altogether way too potent for my taste buds.  This may be to the liking of those who like or can handle really spicy foods but this disagreed with my sensibility.  I measured it right with 250 ml of water (about an 8 oz. cup) and I tried it both hot and cold but it was too powerful either way.  Now if they greatly reduced the amount of ginger and focused on the lemon with just a hint of ginger, they'd be onto something, but as it stands it's quite simply too strong.  The amount of lemon was just fine but someone dropped the ball when mixing it with ginger.  I like the concept but it needs more work before it's perfected.",Interesting But Too Spicy,2

"I should start by saying I only give my baby 4-8 oz of formula a day, otherwise she's breastfed, so the issues I have with this product minimally effect us.<br /><br />It is important to me to give my baby organic food whenever possible, so that is the main reason I picked this product to begin with, also when I purchased the price was better than other organic formulas and it doesn't have corn syrup in it.<br /><br />The downsides:<br /><br />It is difficult to mix, you must use warm/hot water in order to get the lumps out.  And it gets ridiculously frothy when shaken up, like the entire bottle is foam.  What I do now is make a bottle at least a few hours ahead of time and stick it in the fridge, by the time I need to use it, the air bubbles are gone.<br /><br />My baby is not a picky eater at all, so I can't comment on the taste of it.<br /><br />Update:  My baby is now 7 months and takes about 16-18 oz of formula a day.  We noticed that she had been spitting up a lot since increasing her feedings, she would spit up without fail after a feeding, not matter how well she was burped and she would spit up again, sometimes 3 more times in the next hour.  When I happened to run out of this brand and had to use some similac, the spitting up nearly disappeared.  If I had to guess it's due to all the foam in the bottle, but perhaps it's one of the ingredients?  As I mentioned in the above review, the amount of shaking that has to be done to dissolve the formula is ridiculous.  Even with very warm water and a lot of shaking we'll have lumps of undissolved formula in the bottom of the bottle.  I am very disappointed because the price is right and it's one of only 2 options of organic formula that isn't full of arsenic.  Unfortunately a new shipment of 4 of these canisters arrived after realizing this, so we're stuck with it.

"This rice milk mix is not particularly soluble in water -- you have to use a blender, or a wire whisk and very hot water. Which makes extra work.

It becomes more gummy, even if it's restirred/shaken.<br /><br />It just doesn't have the clean flavor and texture that Rice Dream or Trader Joe's brand has.

"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TNXSZG"">Guayaki Traditional Loose Yerba Mate</a> is a personal favorite, as is Peet's Coffee and Tea Masala Chai. Both of them have their own unique qualities that are great in a cup of tea, Guayaki's Mate in it's own unique taste, and Peet's Masala Chai in its pungent and fragrant mix of spices and black tea.<br /><br />So, naturally, I thought that I'd like Chai Mate. Wow... was I in for a surprise. The resulting mixture was a disappointingly weak blend of Mate and other ingredients. Now, I believe a great cup of Chai to be one that you can smell from thirty feet away - and you absolutely will get that with a good correctly brewed cup of Peet's. Pour some cream into it, and the dark color of the tea blends with the cream into a delicious looking cup of tea. Or even enjoy it plain. Or just with sugar. And the same with Loose Yerba Mate, you know the taste, you want a strong cup of tea, and you want it's flavor.<br /><br />With Chai Mate, you get a weak tasting Mate taste and a insipid tasting Chai taste that overall smells way too healthy for Chai and way too weak for Mate. Overall these two don't mix - neither, incidentally, does cream... pour some of that into the tea and it will look watery, thin, and not very inviting.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, buy the Traditional Loose Yerba Mate and then buy a tin of Peet's Masala Chai and have two cups of GREAT tasting tea, not one cup of bland, insipid, and watery tea.","Mate Tea is Great, Chai Tea is Great, Chai Spice Mate is So-So",2

"Are we talking about the wild sardines?<br /><br />Uh-uh. We're talking about me, who as of this writing has lapsed into Amazon reviewer oblivion, with a ranking of 1002. Seeing my name appear without that little ""Top 1000"" moniker makes me feel vulnerable and exposed.<br /><br />What to do about it? Submit yet another review of a tin of sardines. I can't think of a better means of clawing my way back to the top.<br /><br />This time it's Wild Planet Wild Sardines in Marinara sauce. I already did the ones in olive oil, as well as those with a dash of lemon juice.<br /><br />So, here goes...<br /><br />There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />For instance, what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that there's no other kind, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste. Dunking them in marinara doesn't do much to change this.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with...",In The Wilderness,2

The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.

"I picked up a package of Via out of curiosity. For the record, I am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won ""Coffee Bar of the Year"" for the past 4 years in CT. We roast coffee for other cafes as well so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like. Here's my impression of Via:<br /><br />It is certainly easy to prepare. I generally drink a 16oz coffee so I used 2 packets (they are sized for an 8oz serving) to prepare my cup. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black and what I taste is only the coffee (my preference for brewing water is a neutral pH of 7, a Langelier Index of zero and no chlorine, fluoride, or lime).<br /><br />On to the coffee:  A good Colombian should be very balanced, with good body, brightness* and a nutty flavor. Truth be told, most Colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring, and most are at best a simply decent, clean cup with almost no aftertaste. Unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh** from a roaster which is unlikely.<br />The Via Colombian that I tried might have started out as an Arabica coffee from the low end of the Specialty Coffee spectrum. Since I don't know the timeline for production, it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a ""woody"" note that I associate with aged beans. The actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately Via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste. After a few seconds, there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent. I typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known ""donut"" shop coffee (which I am mystified why anyone would drink...just terrible). As for the flavored versions of Via, I am really not a fan of ANY flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee. I drink coffee because I like the flavor. This was my second tasting of Via. I tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar. I really think that a high end instant is a good idea, but unfortunately for me, Via misses the mark.<br /><br />For a quick and relatively convenient cup, I would suggest investing $30 in an ""AeroPress"" made by Aerobie and widely available. Armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster, you get a tasty, easy to prepare cup, and a very simple cleanup..<br /><br />* We use the descriptive term ""acidity"" to describe brightness. This is not to be confused with the often heard term ""acidic"" which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs. This is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, molds, fungus, and other contaminants often found in non-specialty grade coffee. We believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee.<br />** Fresh = less than two weeks from roasting. Most coffee is WAY beyond this timeline....",I like the concept of an instant coffee....,2

"I bought 2 variety packs and the  flavors seem to be fairly decent and varied especially taking into consideration the low price.

"These are a pretty good snack.  But, there's nothing extremely out of the ordinary.  After trying the cocoa covered almonds (simply delicious), I had high hopes for these babies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. They are pretty good.  But, I had some jalapeno flavored peanuts a week or so ago that were delicious.  Black pepper while it gives these a little kick is not enough for a real spice lover.  It does kind of sneak up on you after you've had a few though.<br /><br />BTW, the nuts are also flavored with sugar, citric acid (adds a touch of tartness, I think) onion, ""spice"" and ""natural flavor"" in addition to the sea salt and black pepper.  You can definitely taste the sugar, onion and the citric acid (kind of a citrus twang- not a lot, just a hint)  That's something I would have liked to have known before purchasing.  But the taste that comes through is the sea salt and black pepper.  Actually quite a bit of black pepper. After trying them over again, I don't like them as much as at first.<br /><br />If you're looking for real cashew flavor with just a hint of spiciness, these are OK- not bad at all.

"I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.",Not to my cat's taste- but adding warm water helped,3
"I'm not on a diet or anything, my husband just bought these because they were on sale at the local grocery store and was intrigued by the Just Add Yogurt label (we are huge yogurt eaters). These are pretty decent brownies: almost-normal consistency, fudge-y taste (batter was amazing!). But there is a slight odd after-taste (fruity? cocoa powder?), if you have sensitive taste buds and are used to the standard brownie. To get by that, just eat these with ice cream or whipped cream and strawberries. (Although that kind of defeats the purpose of the fat-free I guess). I probably won't buy these again just because I love regular ol' brownies. But these were fun to try.",Good brownies to eat with ice cream,3

"I bought this variety pack so my cats could try the chicken flavors without fish, but they hated it. However, they did like a couple of flavors...so I will order those (if I can remember which ones! argh)<br /><br />My BIG questions/concern: the fine print on the bottom of each can says ""feed one can for every 3 lbs of bodyweight daily""...<br /><br />One of our cats weights 16 lbs (Maine Coon) and the other, 12 lbs, so I will need to feed a total of 9 cans/day. (who can afford that?) This MUST be wrong info?<br /><br />What cat would eat that much food in one day?<br /><br />Makes me question the company. (they also included one flavor that had menadione sodium bisulfate - a known carcinigen - listed on the can, but when I called I was assured they eliminated that from all flavors last year, and that they just haven't ""caught up"" with new labels yet.  hmmmmm.<br /><br />If you are feeding this food, do YOU feed according to the label instructions?<br /><br />I've been feeding/offering 1-2 cans of Fancy Feast Classic/day to my 2 cats, but they never finish it.<br /><br />Why do I need to almost triple that amount of Tiki Cat?  (I do put out high quality (40% protein) kibble 24/7.  A good quality, high protein kibble fills up cats in all the right ways, so one expects them to eat less. My cats only eat 1/2 cup of kibble/day (that's total for both, not each cat!)  Seems way too little, but they maintain their weight just fine on it and the FF. So, I have to wonder about how TikiCat came up with the huge amount needed to feed?<br /><br />I'd love to hear what others do. If cats ""need"" that many cans of TIKI CAT, then each can must be very low on nutrients, as I assume to get the proper nutrients, they need all those cans as per the label?  I hope someone can make sense out of this.  I emailed the company just now as I totally missed that last line until placing an order for Hookena Luau, Hana Luau & Napili Luau. (some of their cans have better (safer) ingredients than others; and those are the more expensive ones & of course those are the ones I will feed IF I find out I don't need to follow the feeding guidelines.....)","Too much fish for a variety pack, but....",3

"Now, I'm already a big fan of Red Leaf Tea's green apple matcha, but that one really does taste like a green apple, tart and sweet all at the same time. Which is great, but every once in a while a girl needs a smoother apple, a juicer, sweeter apple, which is what I hope to gain from this matcha. I'm eager to try it as a latte with vanilla soy milk and some of their Cinnamon Matcha...I'm hoping for a apple pie with ice cream kind of drink. I love apples and apple juice, so whenever I spot an apple blend, I have to try it. And there are so many things you can do with apple that I'm hoping to be able to do with this apple matcha. Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea. But personally I'm going to stick with the Green Apple matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas.",An Apple A Day...,3

"ADVANTAGES:  (1)Although Vigo sells its squid in tiny 4-ounce cans, these cans are fully packed with squid meat so the quantity of squid meat per can is actually not as inadequate as it might seem at first.  (2)The chunks of squid are of high quality and taste very good.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)Some people would classify the easy-open lid as an advantage but I feel that it is a slight disadvantage because of the risk of splattering the contents all over the floor, table, or countertop.  (2)The biggest disadvantage is that soybean oil is added to make it taste better.  This increases the calories and decreases the healthfulness.  Walmart sells Flower brand A1 Seasoned Cuttle Fish in large 6.5-ounce cans for only $2.03 each.

I truly prefer coffee for a jump start and some of the other drinks to get an actual juice flavor.

The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.

Pretty pricey for a broken box. Also the bottom of the mug looked like it had been used. There was a dark stain on it. Upon further inspection it was just dust from the tea leaves that had been put inside the mug, but it was a little embarrassing to give my mom a gift that at first looked like it had been used before.<br /><br />Overall, though it was a good purchase.

If I'd known that these were about as spicy as ketchup, I would not have ordered tham and will likely not order them again because I prefer my jerky to have at least a little heat.<br /><br />Those complaints aside, this stuff is very tender and has a good and strong BBQ flavor (spicy or no).

"The beauty of store bought prepackaged granola bars is that they are convenient and are usually non-sticky/messy compared to homemade ones.<br /><br />Nature Valley has always made some excellent bars that did not melt into a soggy mess when stashed in the car or brought on extended roadtrips/hikes/camping in the warmer months.  However, this new line of bars from Nature Valley features a sweet peanut coating similar to the yoghurt coating pretzles are dipped in.  This coating is quite sweet and melts in the heat.<br /><br />I would not reccomend particular Nature Valley line for outdoor activities in the warmer months, but would not hesistate to for the winter months.<br /><br />It is also a great treat to get kids off candy bars and into healthier granola bars as the sweet coating is quite peanuty and sweet enough.  The bar itself does contain crisped rice that their original crunchy line does not, but it is still a vast improvement healthwise over other more common snack bars available.",Tasty but peanut covering is messy in the heat.,3
"I first bought this brand of walnuts at my local store and loved them. They were fresh, crispy and had a hint of spice on them taht made them a tastey snack. I am trying to reduce my cholesterol and walnuts have the correct oils that help with this. So I bought a couple cases of these from Amazon. The nuts I recieved are just as fresh and crispy, but the spices on these containers for some reason are almost overwhelming. There are many nuts in the package that are caked with the mix of garlic, onion paprika, etc..., so much to the point that I have now taken to rinsing them off. This makes them a big soggy.., None the less, they are still a good value compared to the store prices, and you can rinse them , use them in recipes and they take just fine.

So, although the resealable packaging is great, and the cat depicted on the bag is cute, this won't be a winner in our household.

I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the ""sweet"" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.",The taste isn't quite right...,3

"I purchased these treats on Amazon thinking they would be like the chocolate covered pomegranate seeds at Trader Joe's, but unfortunately they are not. While they are quite tasty (yes, I will be finishing the bag!), the expectation was that there was actually going to be pomegranate as the main ingredient. The name is misleading and, like many food companies, this seller is jumping on the bandwagon of adding the smallest amount of the fruit in the mix and using its name in the title. The pomegranate juice concentrate is mixed with several other fruit juices, and there is no indication on the package of how much pomegranate is actually in there. Trader Joe's version is actual pomegranate arils covered in a small amount of chocolate - definitely could qualify as a ""healthier"" treat option. These, unfortunately, do not. Quite tasty, but don't kid yourself on any health benefits here - too much sugar! FYI: 180 calories and 26 grams of sugar in ¼ cup (about 16-20 nuggets).",Pomegranate in the name is deceiving,3
"I used to buy tins of this all the time.  I wish they still sold it like that.  This was always my favorite flavor.  After much waiting and always searching the stores I got online to track this down.  I found it here but in large vending machine quantity.  That is the reason it lost one star.  I still have several big bags of this in my closet.  Guess I'm good to go for a while!  I have found to help keep this fresh I use an old plastic Nestle Quik container.  One bag fills it right up.<br /><br />This lost the second star for the product itself.  First I find this much weaker than it used to be in the tins.  I have to add more to each cup to get the right flavor.  Second this is Very chalky and Very Very powdery.  I can taste the powder in it which before I could not.  I even tend to have a powdery residue at the bottom of my cup as well.  This may be because this was for a machine or something so it has a slightly different consistency.  Although about the time this was leaving the shelves of stores I noticed a change in several of the other flavors.  All of which were changing slightly in ways like that.  That was also when they started making some of their lattes foam up.  So I don't know if this changed during that time as well.<br /><br />Simply, this fills the void that was left since I no longer find it on the shelves.  Its not a perfect match to what I fell in love with but it is definitely still tasty. I would order it again to have it and probably will whenever the day comes when I run out again.",Good but..,3

"Instructions for setting the Victor 0610 gopher trap can be found online, but it would have been helpful to include them with the trap, or a link to the *.pdf file. Instructions say to use 2 traps side-by-side (trigger pans facing one another), laid parallel to the ground in the gopher's horizontal tunnel, on each side of a fresh vertical gopher hole. Leave the tunnel open since the gopher will come back to fill it with soil.  After several failed attempts to set the trap (my thumb on the lever was in the way), the easiest way for me was lying it on a table with the jaw end hanging off the table top. A pair of needle-nose pliers to hold the jaws open helps too.  You don't need to bait the trap, but I am trying a bit of peanut butter. You also use a stake and piece of rope tied to the trap/stake to keep the gopher from dragging the trap along the tunnel.  So far the gopher has sprung the trap several times, but got away.  I rated it as 3, but am waiting to see if I can catch the critter. Leather gloves were also helpful. Update: After a few months we caught no gophers in the traps.  Next we bought gopher repellent in the form of castor oil pellets to form a linear barrier.  Finally, we were able to send the gophers away from our house for now.  For us it was the pellets that worked.",find the instructions online; needle-nose pliers helps; still no luck,3

"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.",Not impressed,3

"I have tried using this product with my new son and it has brought mixed results.  I recommend that when using this product with your baby that you exclusively use it during a feeding without mixing in breast milk or another formula.  On more than one occasion my son has spit this right up or just plain thrown it all up.  I'm not sure if this is because it is a water mixed formula, being a powdered formula, or because of the mixing.  Some of the time he seems to keep it down and be alright, but I have discontinued use of this product in favor of another Enfamil product - the milk-based ready-to-go 6-pack bottles with nipples.  Those ready-to-go bottles are much better than this powder formula you mix with water, although more expensive.  I would really really recommend sticking to breast feeding ladies because my son craves his mom's milk and goes right to sleep, happy as can be.

"You've heard the saying: If it's too good to be true, it probably is...<br /><br />Well, I received my Whey Low products and made some mini vanilla cupcakes (a low-fat recipe using shredded zucchini) topped chocolate butter cream icing.  I used the Whey Low D (for diabetics) in the cupcakes and Whey Low powder for the icing.  Both products certainly performed better than Splenda (and even the Splenda for Baking sugar/splenda blend).  It looks and tastes like sugar in the cupcake recipe.  It baked up beautifully and browned nicely.  I was very pleased with the Whey Low D's performance in the cupcake.<br /><br />The Whey Low Powder at first looked like it was going to make great butter cream icing, but after spreading it on the cupcakes, it began to loosen up and turned into a thick glaze after a short while.  The taste is sweet, but the icing was grainy in texture.  Within a few hours, the icing had begun to run a bit down the sides of the cupcakes and by morning it was a wet puddle at the bottom of each cupcake.  So, it did not perform like ordinary powdered sugar in this recipe.  I think it would work fine for making a glaze or for dusting the top of a cake, but not for a real cake frosting.  Also, I would suggest eating it within a few hours of application, otherwise it will break down and be a mess.  The results were quite disappointing and only slightly better than Splenda in this type of recipe.<br /><br />The unfortunate news is that the mini cupcakes did raise my blood sugar to some degree, so you can't expect your blood sugar to not be affected.  I ate three mini cupcakes for my test, then I checked my blood every 30 minutes for about 1½ hours and it went steadily up from 150 to 202.  Whey Low declares that it's 70% lower in calories than regular sugar, which may still make it a good choice for cakes and cookies over using regular sugar if you want to make a special dessert, such as a birthday cake once a year.  But I don't plan to replace Splenda in most of my cooking because of my blood sugar results.  NOTE: Ordinarily, I wouldn't have eaten three mini cupcakes in one sitting, but I did this time because I wanted to see how my blood sugar would react to a larger dose of the Whey Low in what might be a normal serving of cake (and one mini cupcake wouldn't have been large enough).<br /><br />Whey Low is not the miracle I hoped it would be, but I'm glad to know of an alternative to Splenda for baking cakes and other baked pastry sweets.  I very rarely make them, but on my birthday or at Christmas I do like to have a piece of cake and have it taste ""normal.""  I will reserve Whey Low for these rare, special occasions.<br /><br />Sorry folks!  I guess we still can't have our cake, eat it and not feel the effect on our hips and in our blood sugar readings.  Darn.....",Recommended only for special occasions,3

Maybe I'm not meant to be a mojito person, or maybe I've just never had a good one, but when you combine two or more flavors, you really expect them to compliment each other in some way. Mint and lime don't seem to do this, so essentially what you've got here is two clashing flavors creating something less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />If you do like this combination and you don't mind fake sugar, this isn't bad. I didn't get a chance to try this with a shot of rum added (I imagine someone did though), so I don't know how it is used as a drink mixer, but as a soft drink/water flavor, it was meh at best. Either that, or it just doesn't appeal to my taste buds and the three star rating is being unfair. But it is what it is.",A refreshing novelty and not much more,3

One look at them from my all-too-human perspective and I had a whole new scale by which to determine how important my art as a reviewer really was to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I found the reactions of the three cats I gave these to a surprisingly mixed bag.<br /><br />One, the finnickiest eater that will do anything for a piece of Salisbury steak half the size of your pinky, ate one whole one (which I had to break into quarters) and lost interest halfway through the second one. The second one sniffed at a piece exactly once and walked away, while the skinny and freakish third one that never liked me (they're my roomate's cats, not mine) had a reaction that, translated into words, would have been this more or less:<br /><br />""Hmmm... I see you have that. What is that? interesting... aroma, yes, the word is aroma... intriguing... perhaps even enticing...<br /><br />Where did you get it? Give it to me. Give it to me now!<br /><br />Hmmm... Yeeeeees...<br /><br />You have more, don't you? Good. Give it to me! Give it to me now!<br /><br />[chewing] Yes.

"Shipping was quick and pricing significantly below what I was paying at the local pet supply stores.  Items were packaged well and there was no overwhelming smell when opening the package.  I have 2 dogs and both like these items very much. My issue is the smell while the dogs are chewing on the bully sticks.  I have read on the Internet that some bully sticks do not stink when being consumed.  The claim is that the bully sticks are prepared by draining them of fluids at some point in the processing.  I've purchased these sticks at pet supply stores for between $2 and $4 each.  These are no different.  My personal expectations was there would be less smell, thus the 3 star rating. However, I need to emphasize that the product was delivered quickly which is important.  I'm sure if my dogs could rate these they would give a 5 star rating.  One of my dogs will finish off a stick in about 20 minutes while the other smaller dog may only be less than a fifth through the stick in 20 minutes. From this perspective they do keep the dog busy, and I'm supposing that it is accurate that these treats are much better for your dog than than the rawhide chews. My dogs love those too but get gassy eating them.  I've read that dogs don't digest them very well.<br /><br />I would definitely buy from this source again if I find out that it is a myth that some bully sticks don't stink while the dogs are chewing on them.

"I had never had ginger snap cookies before this, so I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />Maybe I just don't like ginger snap cookies to begin with?<br /><br />I thought it would be crispier, MUCH thinner, and with more ""baked,"" almost a burnt sugar, caramelized (think Creme Brulee) flavor, but instead, it was a very strong rooty, gingery flavor (which I guess makes perfect sense, since it's ""ginger snap cookies"").<br /><br />Rather, it is very thick, ticker than a waffer, and about the same size. I wish it were smaller, more bite-sized, and much thinner. It is hearty, if that is the flavor you're looking for, you would love it. I did not enjoy it as much personally.<br /><br />One of the reviewers said it's great because it's not very sweet... I would beg the contrary. It was quite sugary to my taste buds.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you were looking for a light snack, this is probably not for you. However, if you want very bold and hearty flavors, you might want to give it a try.","Too sweet, too thick...",3

"This is the second coffee I have tried from Coffee Bean direct, and my experience has been similar with the 2.  It is fresh and aromatic, arrived quickly and is a good value, but not as good as coffee I have gotten from other roasters.<br />Celebes kalossi is one of my favorites beans; generally a bright full bodied cofee which is not acidic.  The beans I got from coffee bean direct were fresh & oily, but roasted a little too dark, a bit bitter and not as bright as the other Celebes I have had.  Given that I can not get it locally at all, and stopped ordering from another online coffee shop when they raised their shipping rates (effectively doubling the cost of the coffee) it leaves me in a quandry.  I was going to order some4 Tanzanian Peaberry, my other favorite, but having been a little disappointed with the yergecheffe, I am up in the air on that one.  I see they carry Kenya AB, which I have never seen before (only Kenya AA) and have to wonder if they are buying lower quality beans? (certainly that is what would be indicated by the lower quality Kenya coffee).  Before I saw that I thought perhaps the roast was just off.  I guess I will have to think about it while i finish the 10 lbs of coffee in the freezer.  If I could get Aftrican coffee and Celebes locally, I probably wouldn't think about it.  It is not bad, and is nice for a change.  If it was as good as what I had been getting before I would keep both on subscription.  So nice to get coffee delivered this way, and Amazon has been really excellent service all around in this area.  i only wish the coffee was better.","Fresh, fast & a good value, but....",3

"A year ago I swore off of eating  bread for good. I am gluten intolerant and I just thought there was no point in eating GF bread which was, imo, terrible. I could never understand why people were so hooked on their bread that they were willing to eat a far inferior version of it rather than let it go. I have since gotten married and am trying to get my husband to go GF too, since it is a healthier lifestyle. One of the things he doesn't do anymore is buy bread, but sometimes still yearns for it, especially for hamburgers. I caved and bought some of this mix since BRM has been good to me for other things GF and I thought I would give this bread a chance. Boy am I glad I did. My first time baking it and it turned out wonderfully. It is fluffy, soft, with a hard crust on the outside. I let it rise too much and it rose way far above the bread pan, but that didn't seem to do much except give me a nice big loaf. The batter was *very* sticky when I was mixing it up and it all stuck on the blades, but once I got it off the blades and into the pan, it turned out very nicely. I did add slightly less butter than was called for (simply because hubby spilled a little accidentally). Maybe the less moisture helped the bread to stay together without caving? Who knows. All I know is that it worked.<br /><br />Of course, since the batter heavily leans towards bean flour, there is a slight taste difference than regular bread, but imo, that makes it even better. I am glad to have my other packages of this on hand. I won't make it all the time since even gluten-free carbohydrates are still bad in excess. But as a treat or when my husband plans to have hamburgers, it will be the first place I'll look for good GF bread.<br /><br />*edit July 12, 2012* After eating this a few times, I found that the high amount of bean flour contained within makes it hard for me to digest, with unpleasant side effects. It's really too bad as the bread itself bakes up beautifully and tastes good. However, the bean flour is just too hard on my digestive tract, so I probably won't be buying this anymore, once I use up what I have. Unfortunately I had to mark down my review from 5 stars to 3 because of this.","Cooks up well, but bean flour is hard to digest",3

"When made according to the directions on the container, which is 4 teaspoons to a cup (8 ounces) of boiling water, the result has no coffee flavor that I could detect, so calling it latte is misleading.<br /><br />I made a second batch of Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte, 9-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4) using about FIVE times as much powder and nearly boiling skim milk, which made it more flavorful and less weak-tasting, of course, but I still detected no coffee flavor, just spices that I think include cinammon and nutmeg.<br /><br />The mixture either way does produce a foam on top, even without stirring, which is interesting.  As time passes and you drink the level down the foam remains on top (albeit with ever-shrinking bubbles over time).<br /><br />I will not replace this product, and I subtract 3 stars from 5 because of its high price per unit of mouth-pleasure to me and its low flavor and its low healthfulness ratio when used at full-flavor strength and its high degree of coffeelessness.<br /><br />However, unlike some previous reviewers, I subtract no stars because it does not smack of pumpkin flavor.  I'm not sure, which is noteworthy, but I don't think this powder was ever designed to smell or taste or look or feel or sound like pumpkin.  The label on the container is confusing, and it differs from the name of the product on the Amazon description page, but either way I think it is not supposed to taste like pumpkin.  I confess I chose this product because I thought it would taste like pumpkin, which is a flavor I like.  Sometimes in the heat of the moment choosing products I make mistakes:)<br /><br />However -- just to be clear -- whichever name you use there's no doubt it is said to be a latte, which is by definition the flavor of coffee with milk and which, as I said, it does not taste of which at all to me.<br /><br />However, it does make for a good addition to a pumpkin smoothie.  The spices add a fine kick, and for this off-label use I add back 1 star.<br /><br />However, if you decide to use the product this way, keep in mind that the first two ingredients are sugar and non-dairy creamer, which presumably means you'd want account for them in your recipe.<br /><br />Anyway, having so much left over, I decided to try some off-label uses, and here's what I found.<br /><br />-- If you sprinkle on and rub in 2 teaspoons of this powder on each side of a one-inch-thick, 24-ounce ribeye steak and sear it for 2 minutes on a side in a little butter and olive oil and then bake it at 400 F for another 6 minutes or so till it reaches an internal temp of around 120 degrees F and then let it rest for 3 minutes in a loose aluminum-foil tent so the juices can resorb throughout the meat, the dog will eat it.  If you do all that to a second 24-ounce ribeye steak and then cut it into pieces that are small enough, the cat will eat some.<br /><br />People will not.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for a gasoline additive such as STP, this product is not successful.  It turns out you should really not pour several ounces of what is more sugar and non-dairy creamer than anything else into your 1994 Thunderbird's gas tank unless you have an extra several hundred dollars lying around to pay for the expense of removing all traces of it from what turn out to be many, many parts of your car.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for a natural fertilizer such as manure, for most U.S. farmers this will prove to be too expensive.  If you need as little as 500 pounds of real manure per acre, for example, you will need over $3,600 worth of Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte, 9-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4) for that same acre.<br /><br />The Amazon description page for the 9-ounce package says each ounce costs 91 cents, which means $14.56 per pound, which means $7,280 for 500 pounds.  Even if we reduce that by 50% for a quantity discount, that's still $3,640 per pound, which in terms of manure is exactly 2.1333 orders of magnitude higher, which is why you don't see a lot of reviews from farmers who've tried this as I have.  Also, all the crops you raise on land you treat this way and all the animals you let graze on it for the next five years will die.<br /><br />-- The empty container, according to embossing on the bottom of it which no other reviewer seems to have noticed, is both diswasherable on the top rack and non-microwavable.",Weak or unhealthful,3

"The product itself was a decent size and the quantity seemed a lot more than it actually was.  The quality however was not so great.  I had purchased these chocolates to make part of my engagement favors, but was disappointed that the foil/wrapping quality was horrible.  It was very wrinkly and cheap.  There were tears in at least 30 of the chocoaltes that I had to toss because I could not use due to the tears in the foil.  They were on the other hand tasty and I would buy again just for decor or regular guests and not for a formal event.  Due to the wrinkly foil and quality they appeared quite cheap.  The customer service was great and the staff was very helpful so nothing negative about the company itself.  I will buy again just with caution!",Not as expected.,3
"This ad indicates root bark, and the item on the invoice as received says root bark.  The invoice item number matches the label, and the company says there is only the one sassafras product.

A needless worry maybe, but since sassafras root is hard to find due to the probably bogus safrole rigamarole, this makes me suspicious.  Hence, for the confusion, three stars only for the prompt delivery and a 800 customer number that answered the phone after 5 pm (even if the agent couldn't answer my question).",But is it ROOT Bark??,3
"We and our guests had wanted to try an authentic Virginia ham.  We ordered a Smithfield (large, bone-in).  The ham was 15 pounds (advertised as 13-15 pounds).  If a ham can be beautiful, then this one was, as we pulled it out of the oven.  We chose to use the 2nd recommended preparation method which was to soak for 24-36 hours and then roast.  The 1st recommended preparation method was to soak and then prepare in a steam pot (something you would see on a buffet line somewhere).  The ham was delicious, but very salty.  If I had to do it again, I would have soaked longer and changed the soaking water several times.  We are using leftovers in beans and in potato soup and letting the meat do the salting of the dish.","Good, but salty",3

"My dogs can pack on the pounds quickly especially during the winter month so I am always on the look for low calorie alternatives to dog treats that they can enjoy without gaining unwanted weight.  These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats.",A Nice Alternative to Dog Treats,3

"These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.<br /><br />The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.<br /><br />If I were rating these only on flavor and texture I'd give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some people's limit for a snack.  But let's be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.<br /><br />For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.

"Since it's the worst part of the summer in Texas, it was hard for me to say no to ""free"" water from the Amazon Vine program. With daily average temperatures of 105 plus (and no end in sight until September), I am always dying to keep hydrated and it just seems like I never have enough water (and I get sick of buying it so often). So, I thought this was worth a try, despite the seemingly bloated health boasts on the label.<br /><br />First, this tastes like normal filtered water -nothing special. Then, there's the health claims -since I only had one bottle of this and I didn't have the opportunity to see if it makes a difference over time. But let me put it this way: in the harsh Texas heat, this water didn't seem to make a difference at all when it came to hydration, health or anything else. Maybe it's just the heat, but I seemed to have the same benefits as drinking regular (and not-so-expensive) water from the store brand. Perhaps, if I used this over a period of time I would be able to see a difference, but since Vine only sent one bottle it's a little difficult to tell.<br /><br />Verdict: this is an over-priced item that promises more health benefits than it actually delivers. Not worth the price and not the time.",Seems like normal water to me...,3
"A few years ago we received a gift of salt someone brought us from Hawaii.  A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I've been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I'd try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don't get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It's a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don't get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it's nothing or simply too much.  I know, I'm giving a lot of words here.  It's just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven't found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it's either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I'm tossing it in the garbage because it's too much a pain at meal time when I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't say it's awful because maybe it's us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don't get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I'll take a stand and say - we don't like it.  I've tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.  Going back to Morton's course kosher salt or our sea salt bought locally in Maine until I find that salt that matches the gift from Hawaii...",I don't get it,3

"Okay, first of all, be sure you note the design.  This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container. The idea seems to be that you just have the dog lick it directly off the roller ball.  This plan happens to be a poor plan.  The roller ball doesn't roll freely.  So, I wind up sticking my fingers on the ball to help it roll--thereby getting nasty liver smells on my hands. I do have the liver flavor only; I *thought* Vine was sending one of each flavor, but we just got liver, so my dog has only ""taste tested"" this one flavor.  She approved heartily of the taste.  Scored big wags.  These are low cal, but unless your dog is on a particularly restricted diet, she/he should be able to spare a few calories a day for treats (there are several 2-10 calorie per treat options out there, like Zukes and Mother Hubbard Minis.  Good old fashioned green beans make good, all natural, dog treats, too).  If it dispensed more easily, I would have given this  four stars instead of only two.  But the combination of it's oddity and having to finagle the roller ball with each use lost it at least one star.  Personally, I rate it two stars; my dog however gave it five (she basically likes food in general, though, and she's never met a treat she didn't like).",It's soooo weird!  Doesn't dispense well.,3

"Chocolate and healthy just doesn't mix well. These bars are no different. And at 190 calories for one bar (and the bar is actually way smaller than the wrapper)  it's just not worth it, especially if it doesn't even taste all that great. These bars have a consistency of the fake, Little Debbie brownies, mixed with an earthy, dirt texture, and just a hint of bird food. The actual chocolate flavor is very masked and the almonds are completely tasteless.  There is almost no redeaming quality for them, aside from the fact that I've actually eaten far worse chocolate bars. There are FAR better, healthy alternatives for chocolate lovers who actually want something good out of their indulgence. South Beach Living Fiber Fit Mocha Granola Bars are pretty much the best one's I've eaten in the healthy category. At least they actually taste delicious AND have fiber. However, for the vegans and vegetarians in the world out there, these Pure Bars are certainly edible and like I said, better than some I've had.

Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine.

"This kept by 150lb Giant Newf busy for an entire day - he couldn't get the treat discs out and because they are so hard he chewed on it for hours without eating them all.<br /><br />Then my 65lb hound dog stole it from him, quickly figured out how it worked and chewed up the BALL portion until the treats were accessible.  Within 15 minutes of her having it the ball was in pieces all over the floor and she had taken out both treat discs. There was $20+ down the drain.<br /><br />The ball and the treats are Made in China - the treats are rock hard, the main ingredient is wheat and I suspect it is closer to some sort of wheat gluten glue that hardens - when  wet it does smell a bit and does leave a mess on the carpet. The ball is a jelly plastic that has a strange odor - I had a really hard time getting the treats into the ball so not surprised that the one dog couldn't get them back out. But if your dog can figure it out, or gets frustrated quickly you'll be surprised at how fast that ball will be torn to pieces when the dog turns its chewing jaws from the treat to the ball. Have no idea what the ball is made of and if it is toxic or not so had take it away (and throw it away) before they had a chance to eat any of it by accident.<br /><br />So -<br />Pro: could potentially last your dog a long time and keep him occupied<br /><br />Cons: expensive, Made in China, wheat based treats (allergy alert) and not going to last long if you have a determined dog.<br /><br />Kongs are the only toys my dogs have never been able to tear apart, they are the only things that have survived from puppyhood to now grown, adult dogs.",Depends on the dog,3

"I acquired this coffee through the Vine program.  I found the coffee to be just ok, with nothing to either recommend it or to take away from it. The package lists the grind as extra fine, but it is really just barely a fine grind with several larger pieces in it than you would not normally find in a fine grind.  This is not really an issue unless you really needed a fine grind.  It works just fine in a drip coffee maker with a paper filter.<br /><br />As for flavor, the coffee is not bitter, but does not have much of a personality.

And if you are looking for a chocolate/nut combination in a light to medium blend, Gloria Jean's ""Swiss Chocolate Almond"" is much more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's okay and I will finish the box, but won't be ordering it again. If you are looking for a nut flavored coffee with more of a mixed nut taste, you might enjoy it.",Just Okay,3
"This coffee comes in individually foil-sealed pods. If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you.",Flavorful but weak,3

"After trying Emerald's Sea Salt & Pepper cashews, my household reached a general consensus. We would rather NOT have pepper on our cashews. While there were varying levels of dislike throughout the house, nobody really liked them. My sister thought they were disgusting. My dad, who LOVES cashews, will hardly touch them. I thought they were alright, but they're not something I'd want to eat a lot of.<br /><br />The pepper definitely adds a zest to the cashews. Whether that's good or bad... I guess it depends on your personal preference. If you love nuts & cashews, and you're tired of the same old thing, I'd suggest giving them a try. While I'd rather pass on the pepper, I did like the fact that they used sea salt, which is better for you (nutritionally) than regular old salt.<br /><br />I cautiously recommend this product to anyone who likes a bold flavor.",Hold the pepper!,3

I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes!

"These treats are certainly a new and different idea, but ease of use needs to be improved before they can become something we'd purchase on a regular basis.<br /><br />Certainly, the concept is clever and has potential. The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the ""lick but don't bite"" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors.

When you pull on the tiny tab, 2 out of 3 will rip without opening the seal.<br />- The six containers were well protected in carton shell, but they were a bit hard to take out. I ended up ripping off one of them open while removing it from packaging, and spilling some product.

Well, the concept is good, but the flavor just isn't quite there.<br />I do like this cooking method for pork. I grew up in house where pork had to be cooked to death because ""you could get trichinosis."" Well now you don't have to cook pork forever anymore.<br />Anyway, the amount of S&B powder in the packet was not enough to cover 6 thin pork chops. I took two 4-inch diameter, 1-inch thick boneless chops and pounded them to about 1/2 inch thick. Then I cut those in half. The S&B barely covered those four pieces. I cooked it according to directions and then checked them with a meat thermometer. One had to go back in for a few minutes.<br />My results looked very little like the picture on the package. I'm thinking the ""serving suggestion"" photo was one chop with an entire packet of S&B packed on to it and fluffed up for the photo. The powder itself is that color, it doesn't develop it in the oven.<br />We had to liberally douse the meat with ketchup or Japanese tonkatsu sauce.

"During the late 1990's and early 2000's, this was one of my favorites.  Back then, the 750ml bottle was the only option; I would purchase it to share with friends, trying to introduce them to something new in the beer world.  Strangely, the beer then left the Minnesota markets for a couple of years.  Needless to say I was quite displeased with this.  Despite my efforts, there was just no way that I could logistically get my hands on this now precious and coveted ale.  Then just a couple of years ago, Leffe resurfaced again - this time exclusively in 6 pack form.  Moreover, it was now in virtually every liquor store that carried at least a minimal selection of imported beers.  Although I was pleased that Leffe had returned, it just didn't feel quite right; it was now too ubiquitous, and I missed the old 750 ml corked bottles.  Now, in the past year or so, the 750ml bottles have returned.  Additionally, the sticker price is surprisingly much cheaper (approximately $4 - $6) than its Belgian competitors.  Once again, I was glad to see the return of the quintessentially Belgian corked bottle for Leffe.  However, the significantly reduced cost of the ale made me a bit suspicious.  Regardless, like reacquainting with an old friend, I decided to pick up a bottle to see if Leffe was still one of Belgium's finest.  While there is no doubt that Leffe is still a quality Belgian ale, there seems to be something slightly different with this product, some subtilities that seem to be lacking.  I noticed it mainly in the finish of the beer; there seemed to be a vaguely noticeable ""thinness"" that I've sometimes associated with cheaper quality American brews.  I started to ""smell a rat,"" so I decided to dig a little bit deeper into recent information about Leffe; what I uncovered made my heart sink a little bit...<br />It seems that one major step in the wrong direction for Leffe occurred in 2004.  It was during this time that Interbrew, the company that owned the rights to Leffe, merged with the Brazilian brewing company AmBev.  Changing the company name to InBev following the merger, the conglomerate earned itself a very negative reputation as a ruthless predator in the beer manufacturing world. It is also noteworthy to point out that this was roughly the same time period in which Leffe became conspicuously absent from the shelves of Minneapolis liquor stores.  Coincidence?  Maybe, but I'm willing to bet that it wasn't.  In November 2008, InBev purchased Budweiser giant Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. Changing the name to ""Anheuser-Busch InBev"" (or ""AB InBev"" for short), the newly formed conglomerate was now the world's #1 beer manufacturer.  Moreover, multiple resources that I read cited the fact that AB InBev was now using corn and other cost-effective measures in their brewing process for Leffe -- something that was not being done previously.  In one fell swoop, this explains the recent widespread distribution, the suspiciously low cost, and the noticeably different taste of a once great Belgian ale.  As I write this, I keep shaking my head; I feel a bit duped and betrayed (unfortunately, Leffe is just the tip of the iceberg - other quality beers such as Franziskaner, Bass,  Goose Island, and Hoegaarden are also owned by AB InBev).<br /><br />By most accounts that I've read, AB InBev seems to have garnered a reputation for buying up smaller beer companies and either callously altering their brewing processes (in the name of cost-effective measures) or working toward closing the products lines down altogether.  There's lots of negative information out there in regard to this company... I may need to reconsider how often ( if at all) I should purchase products that support such a dubious organization.",The unfortunate circumstances surrounding a once great Belgian ale...,3

"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317HLQA"">Special K Fruit Crisps, Blueberry, 10-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I ordered these fruit crisps to add a little extra something to my low cal diet.  They are good in both the blueberry and strawberry flavors.  The only thing that I found dissappointing was that they were very thin and after eating one pack I felt as if I had eaten nothing.  Some of the low cal bars are thicker which makes them more satisfying. It is true that you get 2 to a package but because they are so thin 2 bites for each crisp and they are gone I did not find them satisfying.  I wish they were somewhat more substantial in size, but since they are described as crisps not bars I guess the size goes along with the description. I should have paid more attention to the word crisps and realized that they would be very thin.  Had I realized this I would not have ordered them. I understand that calorie watchers cannot eat voluminous amounts of food, but these are almost like eating very thin wafers. The one good thing is that they do taste good and I will finish them rather then having to throw them out or return them. it's just that there isn't enough to eat that would make them memorable. I am undecided as to whether or not I want to order them again, probably not. If you like very thin snack crisps that disappear in 2 bites each these are for you.

"I was interested in the product as it seemed a good and healthy alternative to my normal choice of decaf expresso. First point to know - this is tea.  From the description and even the packaging it is sometimes easy to confuse with some kind of coffee.

They offer several recipes for ways to use the product which I did not try.  Unlike most teas, you use coffee preparation techniques to make Redespresso.<br /><br />Per the directions, I did prepare the tea in a french press.  It was a dark red color, and because the tea is finer than coffee, loose tea does get into the liquid.  The flavor was pleasant, but not overly distinctive for a tea.<br /><br />Overall, it was not as tasty as some of my other favorite teas.

"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.

"I'm pretty sure that this meal has changed drastically since the glowing five star reviews for this have been made. For one, there are no carrots or onions or anything like that which are mentioned in one review. This is simply only roast beef, mashed potatoes, and gravy. That's it. Second, it's not very impressive.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch but TWO of these meals in a row had extremely lumpy mashed potatoes. After heating (and adding extra time in hopes that would help), the mashed potatoes were in a solid block under the meat. I had to smash and stir it for about three minutes before it resembled actual mashed potatoes but they were far from creamy. The lumps left behind were small and numerous and extremely unappetizing to eat (in fact, even though today I ended up skipping breakfast and am starving, I really can't bring myself to eat them).<br /><br />The meat though is surprisingly good. I'm usually not a big fan of many of the red meat in the Hormel line but I really enjoyed this one. But then, it was the best thing about the meal so maybe it's raised up in comparison.<br /><br />The gravy is not even half as salty as the red meat gravy meals tend to be which is an extremely good thing.<br /><br />Honestly, the best thing about these Hormel meals is that they fill you up for a very low price, can be stored anywhere, and really can't be easier to prepare. I ate the meat and about 1/4 of the mashed potatoes in this meal and even with my skipping breakfast, I feel completely satisfied. If these were lower in calories and sodium, I would honestly say these would always be our go-to when needing to grab a meal in ten minutes between meetings.",Not the same recipe as the five star reviews,3

"I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.",Tastes oddly like watery skim milk...,3
"Just got my order today for one bag each of the Tropical (these) for me (I like coconut) and the original (which I thought my hubby would prefer).<br /><br />The cookie: It's kinda small. 2 inches in diameter. (Yes, I got a ruler and measured). Very sweet. I know another reviewer said they weren't sweet, but man, I got a lot of honey impact in my taste test. Very chewy. Coconutty. Not fully a macaroon, there is some sort of undertaste, but very mararoony.<br /><br />Price: Why are 12  cookies 10 bucks? I dunno. BUT..I'll pay it for an occasional cookie-ish treat that's not full of preservatives and weird chemicals.<br /><br />I wish they had one that was all out choco-coconut (like the mounds taste of cookie) or almondy-coconut, without spices and add-ons like the Alpine. I think that would suit me even better. I hope they expand to a more choco type cookie in future.<br /><br />I'm ordering more, as hubby liked the original flavor and I think my sister will like this one (tropical).  The three stars is a combo of plusses for ingredients, pleasantness (though not particularly whoopsie-do fabulosity in taste) and individual wrapping (that preserves freshness and makes these lunch-box friendly), and minuses for the excess honey (way too sweet) and price point. Once you take the shipping into account, it's more than one buck for a 2 inch cookie.<br /><br />Shipping was pretty swift. I got it 6 days from my ordering (and that included the weekend). Stuff arrived fresh.. Thumbs up for that. :D","Like macaroons--chewy, VERY sweet, kinda expensive, but nice with coffee or tea for a non-full-of-processed stuff treat...",3

"This is the first review I have ever written about a product, and I have bought over 300 to 500 items from amazon. I just wonder who packs these boxes? When you advertise a variety pack of 60 with 7 different cereals, one thing that does not come to my mind, is somebody packing the box with what you feel like giving them. Not everybody's favorite cereal is frosted flakes in my case, and or raisin bran for somebody else buying this product. When you spend $56.00 for 7 different kinds of cereal, that's what you think your getting, not what they have more on hand of at the time. There should be an equal distribution of each kind, and if they can not do this please specify this in the product details so consumers are not mislead. Because if I wanted frosted flakes I would go buy a box at the store. The Variety idea is great, but the spending $56.00 for a mystery box of cereal is not. Thanks.",Who packs these boxes?,3

"This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal.",Reminds Me of Garden Medley,3

"I will start by noting that I am a long time fan of Patak's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB1AXG"">Patak's Mixed Relish, Hot, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)</a> with their mixed pickle among my favorite things; (an understatement, I would almost call it an addiction  BUT *the* store which carries it locally has almost tripled the price, so I turned to Amazon... hoping, but, alas, they will not ship to Hawaii.<br /><br />I have found quite a few things here which are as good as, some even better than, my old ""tried and true"" and so I gave the MTR pickle a try.  The price is exceptional.  No complaints in that department, but I personally found this pickle a bit too salty.  The consistency is also different, not as chunky.<br /><br />Now these things are a matter of personal taste, likely more so with respect to food than anything else I can think of.  It is also a bit of a challenge to describe, particularly if you do not know, or necessarily share someone's personal taste.<br /><br />This is not a bad product and I can imagine a lot of people liking it more than I.  Any pickle is going to have a good deal of salt because... that's what a pickle is: something preserved in salt.  I tend to go lower on salt than most.  That said, if you like salty foods, you will like this better than I did.  I also prefer a chunkier consistency.  This pickle approaches a spread.  Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing, more a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />I like the spice blend in Patak's better as well, and this is the most difficult to describe as it is subtle and noone wants to detail their recipe(and I can not think of a single ingredient which stands out).  So, all I can say is that I did not like it as much<br /><br />The MTR pickle is also not as hot, and I personally like HOT.  This is a place where many people will not share my personal preference, as I know from experience that I eat food hotter than the vast majority of people (It was years before my husband could eat curries as hot as I tend to order or prepare them).<br />As Indian pickles go, in my experience, this is on the milder side.  Judging by the reviews I have read of several products here, *most* people will differ from my tastes in this area and probably prefer a relatively milder pickle.<br /><br />All that said, this is a condiment which one would add to bring up the heat in a dish, maybe make it a little more flavorful.  I frequently have Annies frozen entrees for lunch (quick, convenient and healthy); the ones available locally being the spinach and paneer, and one or 2 bean curries with rice.  i find them fairly bland and *always* add pickle (I think without the pickle I would not enjoy them, maybe not eat them at all!).  I think the MTR mixed pickle will work OK to spice up those bland dishes.  It is not something I am going to either throw or give away, however, it is also not something I would order again.<br /><br />I hope I have been able to provide a description which is adequate enough for people to decide whether or not this would be to their taste.  In sum, I found this pickle to be saltier and milder than what I am used to.  It also has a different consistency than most, being somewhat smoother and less chunky.  Again, none of these things is necessarily bad.  It is all a matter of personal taste.<br />Edited to note that by the time we got to the bottom of the first jar I had sussed out the ingredient which threw the taste, and my opinion off.  The ""heat"" is provided by paprika, rather than chile (which is what most or all of the other brands I have had use).  Paprika is nowhere near as hot a cayenne, or chile, and so much more is required to make this hot.  Ultimately it is not as hot, and the other flavors are somewhat diminished (because of the quantity of parika required).  if you like paprika you may like this, and if you don't, get another brand.",a little too salty for my taste,3

It lacks that fullness and bold flavor that I desire, which I guess is what you're getting when you get pecan flavored coffee.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you like bold coffee, avoid at all costs.

"I received this product today and put a small amount in my palm to taste. It had a slight kick to it but otherwise my palate missed all the richness, etc. that other reviewers have noted. It tasted salty w/ a bit of warm spice. I then sprinkled some on mixed vegetables and microwaved them. Typically I use only lemon juice from a fresh lemon and a heaping teaspoon of salted butter. The gentle spiciness was welcomed, but the vegetables tasted a bit too salty. I rarely use added salt except for pasta and popcorn, or when a recipe calls for it, so others may find it is their usual level of saltiness. I applaud the manufacturing process of this product, particularly since it is certified organic.

"Ive tried a few other brand energy drinks and never liked the taste of any. Regardless I would drink the horrible tasting drinks to have the energy without the crash when needed and they did work. I found this No Fear Super Energy Supplement to give the same amount of energy but alot more to drink. The taste was not as bad though as the others - it was decently flavored and ok to drink rather then horrible tasting. It has a cherry flavor taste like cola. It is a 16 ounce can though compared to some 2oz drinks so there is alot more to drink. Keep in mind though the can is 2 servings... I prefer the smaller bottles to a big can.<br /><br />When I compare this to 5 hour energy the ones I am use to the flavor is far better with this drink. BUT its alot more can to drink to feel an affect which I actually then prefer the nasty tasting stuff as its a quick gulp and thats it... rather then a whole can to down. I feel more energized wit ha 5 hour energy, you can totally feel the difference. I did not have that same affect with this- it felt like it was starting to work and I was waiting for that full blown kick in energy but it never came. I can take a 5 hour when exhausted and I'm wide awake and alert for 5 hours no problem. With this I  could still head to bed if I desired.<br /><br />I do like the look of the can, its pretty cool looking but, what matters is inside the can. Energy drinks work differently for everyone.

"It's hard to review for this 3-ounce bag of coffee for two reasons; 1) three ounces is not a lot of joe to go by, and 2) the tests were performed in a brand new <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YPC2NM"">EZ-Cup for Keurig Coffee Machines By Perfect Pod</a>, but let me share the experience with you.<br /><br />First of all, if you have problems with acidic coffee, the chances are good your problems are not as bad as my Dad's issues with it.  He was the test subject because he loves coffee, and can rarely drink it.  He's had 2/3rds of his stomach removed... TWICE.  He's also had Barrett's Esophagus, and has undergone procedures to literally burn the potentially cancerous stuff from his throat.  His sensitivities to acidic foods or beverages are, as you can imagine, severe.  So when I saw a product sample offered on Amazon recently, I jumped at the opportunity for him.<br /><br />He was able to make two cups of coffee using the new K-Cup Pod, but reviews are incomplete because the experimentation with the amount to put in the K-Cup is complete.  There were no instructions as to amount to use on the package of coffee, so we had to guess by dead reckoning (to be honest and fair, even if we'd used a regular brewer, we still weren't sure how much water to put with the three ounces... we imagined that it would have been six.  So we looked at a video on YouTube from Perfect Pod which showed how much they put in, and we followed suit.  What came out, was, according to my Dad, ironically ""weak.""  We probably should have put in more, but the portion we'd used was exactly half the bag, so we didn't have enough left to try it again.  On the positive side, he suffered no ill effects from what he ingested, so that's a promising prospect..<br /><br />My Dad and I have ordered a one-pound bag of Puroast coffee to try again, this time the House Blend.

"I tried this product based on the majority of the recommendations being positive, and that some people even thought it was a rich coffee.

"I like English Breakfast tea and there was nothing wrong with the flavor of this tea when brewed.  However, when used in the keurig machine, my tea consistently had grounds in the bottom.  It's not a big deal to have a few grounds in my tea, but there were a lot more than a few, more than could be ignored.  I ended up not drinking the entire cup because of it.<br /><br />At first I thought it was because most people in the office use coffee k-cups and I was getting coffee grounds in my tea.  But after switching to Timothy's brand of tea I no longer had a problem with grounds.  Usually I had no grounds in my tea or one.<br /><br />After brewing a cup of each, I cut off the foil top.  Both of them have filters built in and the Twinings filter didn't seem to be pierced.  But I had the same grounds in the tea that I hadn't had in my cups of brewed Timothy's tea.<br /><br />To sum up, if you want to avoid grounds in your tea and still have great taste go with the Timothy's k-cups (Timothy's World Coffee English Breakfast Tea, Decaffeinated, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)) instead.",Grounds in my tea,3

"I have tried many coffees, but never a low acid one.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  The aroma of the coffee after brewing was fine, but I felt that it tasted strong like a certain brand from Seattle.  And I don't like their coffee. For a dark French roast it tasted burnt to me.

If the basic flavor is all right, you can always add peppers with no harm done.<br /><br />I had tried the Taco Bell Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce and liked it quite a bit, more as an ingredient than straight. I do not think this is as good. It does have a bit of smoke flavor, and that's pleasant, but I find it has a noticeable artificial taste that was missing from the jalape&ntilde;o sauce. It's almost a rubber-like taste (not texture--that's fine), and I'm not sure how much it would have to be diluted to make it go away. We tried it straight on tacos, and while my husband said it was good enough, it still tasted a bit like a tire to me. I'm not sure whether this means I am a delicate and sensitive flower, or that he is an oblivious lout with no sense of nuance. I will allow that I might have been looking for it after taking a taste directly from the bottle--not the best idea I've ever had.<br /><br />I'll work with it some more to see if I can find a dish it goes with well; it's not a total loss, and we'll finish the bottle--eventually.","All right, but not extraordinary",3

I tried it with sugar -- and then with cream -- and the musky taste is still overpowering. Now this robsutness/musky/oily taste might be something I would appreciate on a cold winter night, perhaps with some grains and butter added, like the barley and butter that are added to the tea that the Buddhist monks drink, to make Tsampa -- and I would not hesitate to try that, in the colder months, as the musky/robust tones of this tea might very well make a satisfying (Americanized) Tsampa.<br /><br />But frankly, this tea was meant to be enjoyed as a stand-alone brew, and unlike their WONDERFUL Early Grey tea, Higgins & Burke English BreakFast Black Tea, is not really my cuppa tea.",Very robust and musky,3

"I tried three of Taco Bell's sauces (creamy jalepeno, chipotle, spicy ranchero) and have reviewed them all on Amazon. This was my least favorite.  The flavor is very strong and overwhelmed food items like traditional beef tacos and fish tacos for me.  However, if you are a true lover of ""chipotle flavor"" you may have a different opinion.  I could taste the vinegar used in this sauce which is a flavor I do not enjoy which is why I do not like jarred salsas either.<br /><br />I did some further experimenting and baked some cheese enchiladas.  After they came out of the oven I drizzled some sauce over the final product and enjoyed the flavor combination.

"We own the Senseo coffee maker and were using the Senseo coffee pods.  I was so excited to find the Javapodz flavored coffee.  However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup.  After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button.  This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers.  It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great.

"I'm a peanut butter fan, I also like chocolate and have eaten the occasional granola bar at times. So, I jumped at a chance to give these bars a try.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed is, there are only 5 bars in a box. A curious number. I mean, they could have certainly fit a 6th one into the box. Second thing I noticed is these bars are small. I know they're not intended as a meal, or anything, but honestly 4 bites and it's gone type of small.<br /><br />Third thing, I couldn't taste the peanut butter and there was only a hint of chocolate for me. Just overall bland. Not gross type bland, just very little flavor.<br /><br />Based on Amazon's way of shipping groceries you purchase a 6 pack of boxes. 5 bars per box, equals 30 bars. I'm not sure the price, size, and taste would have me paying that much for the end value.<br /><br />They are alright, but there are so many other options out there already for bars of this type.

Compare it to a Nestl&eacute; made Kit Kats and the difference is staggering. Nestl&eacute; Kit Kats actually taste like chocolate and not a mere sweet, slightly grainy paste.<br /><br />When a say 'tastes' like Chocolate. You may argue that the taste of Chocolate is what you grew up on. If you grew up on Hershey Chocolate you'd say that was the taste of Chocolate and the Nestl&eacute; chocolate was something else. I would disagree though... having tasted 60% to 80% real chocolate I can say the Nestl&eacute; Kit Kat's taste is much closer to this real chocolate bar.<br /><br />Indeed in Canada you can actually buy Kit Kat Dark which have a higher Cocoa content.

"I received my bottle of Mio Mango Peach flavoring free from the Amazon Vine Program, in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I have a girlfriend who loves Mio and had been encouraging me to try it.  I think the flavor she likes is sweet tea.  So when I saw it offered on the Vine website, I jumped at it.  I drink a gallon of water every day, and sometimes it gets a little monotonous.  What would be nicer than a no-calorie peach/mango flavoring to add to the water, right?<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I won't be buying Mio in the future.  I had to add 3 or 4 squirts to a glass of water to get any recognizable mango or peach flavoring.  And then it had a very strong saccharine-type aftertaste, and an almost perfume-y smell.  The Mio website claims that it uses sucralose and not saccharine, but whatever it was I didn't like it. Unfortunately, sucralose can also cause diarrhea and gas if enough is ingested.<br /><br />A look at the ingredients on the bottle confirmed my suspicions that this was just another way to ingest unhealthy ingredients masked as ""natural"".  Propylene glycol - a type of mineral oil, can cause allergic skin reactions.  Yellow #5, Blue #1, and/or Red #40 - these have been linked to ADHD, hyperactivity in children, and lymphoma. Acesulfame Potassium, an artificial sweetener, aggravates hypoglycemia, and has been linked to breast and lung tumors. That's quite a chemical cocktail we're adding to our water!<br /><br />It does come in a cute little bottle that would go well in a purse or backpack.  And if you are counting carbs or calories, or are diabetic, these drops could be a nice way to flavor plain old water.<br /><br />But for me, I'll just continue to add a squirt of lemon or lime juice to my water.

Now I am analyzing my intake to eliminate the empty calories of cane sugar, corn syrup and the ilk, even the fructose of 100% fruit juices in favor of consuming the whole fruit.<br /><br />What's not easy is choosing whether to use an artificial sweetener. First of all, some people mistrust them, suspect them of being carcinogens etc. and ask whether the cure might be worse than the disease. Some of the other artificial sweeteners, which shall remain nameless, might bear investigation.<br /><br />But Splenda, which has only been available in the US for a dozen years, is sucralose plus dextrose and/or maltodextrin. Sucralose is actually derived from sugar but has no calories. The fillers add calories but not nearly as many as sugar. In addition, Splenda is heat-stable to 450F and does not add an artificial flavor to baked goods. However it is questionable whether the vitamins survive the heat of cooking.<br /><br />I find Splenda especially helpful in making desserts sugar-free when necessary, everything from puddings to pies to betties. This Splenda claims no calories, as do their other varieties. The actual caloric content of a single-serving, 1-gram packet [which is the size of the packet reviewed here] is 3.36 calories, which is less than a third of the calories of a single-serving, 2.8-gram packet of granulated sugar. FDA regulations allow foods to be labelled zero calories, ""if the food contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving"". So that gets just a mite tricky. Regardless of FDA regs, I feel it is questionable to emblazon the packaging with a claim of ""No Calorie Sweetener"" when it actually does have them.<br /><br />Another packaging issue is the description ""Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)"". That made me think I would receive four packages of 0.7 oz. each which I could use in baking. But in fact there are 80 tiny foil packages suitable for use in individual cups of whatever, and the box states ""Each packet sweetens like 2 teaspoons of sugar."" No problem; you just need to be aware of what you will be getting as this stuff is really expensive.",B vitamin Splenda; discussion of caloric content,3
"I have had an online energy session. I then tried the water. While trying to keep an open and objective opinion, I really haven't experienced any change of significance.

"Good concept in terms of a rubber toy with refillable ringed gnaw treats but the treats get ripped out FAST! too easy an access for the dogs.  Mine ate the first two treats within an hour & the last few within the hours of my refilling it.  If you want them to be amused for a while, better to get a Kong.

It's too hard for him to wrap his mouth around as a gnawing toy so without the treats, its just no longer fun for him.<br /><br />Good quality plastic... but overall bad toy for the purpose its trying to fulfill (the purpose being to have the dog leave you alone for a while)","Good concept, poor quality gnaw hide",3

"It is difficult to review food items because everyone has taste preferences that vary.  I purchased this because I wanted some sort of sweetener for my coffee that would not affect my blood sugars. I found the flavoring to be a bit overpowering.  I ended up using less than the recommended amount.  I only use one drop in my coffee. I would suggest you start with one drop and then taste and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />To me the vanilla flavor tastes artificial but you can't find any information on the label other that it contains ""natural"" flavoring.<br /><br />But it does what it promises which is to sweeten and flavor. It will also last for a long time since only drops are used.",It will do.,3
"I really liked this flavor, apart from the bright color which seemed unnecessary.  It's a nice crisp green apple flavor that I enjoyed as an alternative to the standard flavors that are available.

"These House Foods tofu shirataki noodles have only a small amount of soy flour in them - the konnyaku yam flour is still the main ingredient.<br /><br />I couldn't tell much of a difference between these tofu shirataki noodles and regular shirataki noodles - they may be just a bit softer, but not much.<br /><br />Shirataki noodles are not a hydrated starch paste like wheat noodles - instead they have the structure of a firm gel and are 96% water with only a tiny amount of the konnyaku yam flour (a long chain polysaccharide) holding it all together.<br /><br />The gel structure accounts for the mouth feel and chewing texture of the shirataki noodles.  This is also what makes them so filling without getting you all those calories.  The water soluble fiber of the yam flour is also not digested for the most part, and is very healthy for you.<br /><br />They do go great with a lot of different stuff - udon soup, tomato or pesto based spaghettis, etc.  I give five stars for the shirataki noodles.<br /><br />The main problem with the House Foods noodles listed here is their price, especially the exorbitant shipping charges.

"So are energy bars the new fad of eating? Perhaps taking milk out of the equation has led to people finding other sources of energy besides a bowl of sugared cereals. Companies like Kellogs I am sure had to find some means of ""keeping up"" by reconstituting their own brands. Special K, perhaps their most popular ""healthiest"" cereal has come up with this Granola Bar which advertises 4 grams of Fiber and 4 grams of protein. While they advertise the benefits, one should not glare over the fact that this is a ""chocolatey peanut butter"" bar.<br /><br />A serving size is one (1) bar which is 110 calories. There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is ""solluble corn fiber"", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says ""chocolatety"", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me. The back of the box says ""4g of fiber*"". So I am looking around for the qualifier this asterisk is referring to. It is not immediately available, but I see underneath the green balloon where it says ""4g of fiber"" it reads: ""3g of total fat"". I say confusing because it is above, rather than below, but also because I dont know how fiber relates to fat, unless the most of the fiber comes from the oils. Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp ""organic"" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as ""health food"", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste. It is enjoyable. Nothing revolutionary, but tasty nonetheless.",Cereal Bar in the way of Health Food?,3

"Don't mean to be the one who rains on the bandwagon (pardon the metaphor crash), but, while it is definitely true what other reviewers have written -- that the coffee is very strong, very thick, and very dark (add in an acid level commensurate with the sludge-factor) -- I don't find the taste all that strong, and taste is important.<br /><br />True, these K-Cups will provide a pleasant-tasting beverage the consistency and color of Louisiana mud, but for taste, one can do a lot better.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had K-cups of coffee back-to-back today, one of this type and one of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1CC02"">Keurig K-Cup ""Mini-Brewers"" Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold</a>, which is, unfortunately, sold out at the moment.

"I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush.

"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",Cats love it -- but I am concerned,3

"Gotta admit, I did not love these as much as the vegan blondies, but if you're into the nutty, fruity, health bar type of snack, this would be up your alley.

"I bought these before picking up my 2 yr old from daycare.  He is used to having a snack in the car on the way home before naptime.  I usually bring crackers or a banana.  The boy really enjoyed these crackers.<br /><br />My own experience with these crackers is different, sadly.  The first bite was lovely.  But later bites were sadly lacking.  These crackers are like a lesser Cheez It.  There is a little bit (not enough) of cheese flavor, but the unique pretzel energy is lost.  It's best not to combine the modest pretzel with flashier snacks because it can't stand up.  It just winds up giving you a watered-down version of The Other Thing, in this case a Cheez It.<br /><br />I would say, stick with Cheez Its, OR, pretzels, but combining them  minimizes them both.",Nothing to really object about.,3

"I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable.  Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated.  Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve.

"I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.

"I use BBQ Sauce very sparingly, that said, the little that I apply to my finished BBQ product as a final ""glaze"" must be outstanding.  In my opinion, this sauce has a great consistency, not too watery where it sticks quite nicely to the meat.  Unfortunately, they added (liquid smoke essence) to the ingredients.  If one is using a wood fired- charcoal smoker/grill, why would anyone want to add more smoke flavoring?

"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.

"10 individual pouches come in this box, which is handy for sticking it in your purse or in your lunchbox. It is easy to mix up with a glass of water, and does not take long to dissolve.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars? Well, first because it really does not taste like tea, more like berry kool-aid. The second reason is that though the words ""tea & honey"" are splashed all over the product box and the packet, you'd expect that 1) it tastes a little like tea, 2) you could taste the honey, 3) honey is the only sweetener.  I've already talked about it failing point 1. You can faintly taste the honey - it's not overpowering, and was a nice taste. Point 2 in its favor. Now onto point 3; the ingredients are as follows: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetener), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids. I see 3 sweeteners other than the honey granules: sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt. Point 3 against this product. Serving size is also misleading - you'd think one packet is one serving.

By the time I served myself some, it was cold so I put it on a paper plate and zapped it for 50 seconds.  Well, guess what?  Zapping it made the sauce thicken into a rich texture (without zapping it was thin/watery), and I LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  It even tasted kinda like a light cheddar cheese!

There is a bit of tart pomegranate, but I'm not sure that most people would be able to identify the fruit in a blind taste test. However, the flavor was good enough to keep me eating. What wasn't very good was the after-taste. I'm not sure what in the licorice would cause it, but it hits fairly quickly and does not fade very fast. It's sort of bitter, and is not very pleasant. The semi-good news (I suppose) is that it does not increase with the consumption of more licorice - it just stays constant, there in the background.<br /><br />I haven't tried any other flavors of their licorice (if they have any) to know if there is an after-taste with those as well, or if it's something to do with the pomegranate flavor. But I can say with some certainty that I will not be buying this licorice of my own accord.",Bitter After-Taste,3

I was disappointed with this one.  I bought after seeing such good reviews but it has a very strong artificial taste to me.

The popcorn was very fresh tasting. Adding the drizzle of fudge did not bring a taste of chocolate.

"Nice caramel apple flavor (its an artificially sweetened powder that completely dissolves and empties out of the k-cup). This can have a somewhat strong/tart flavor on small cup setting, so i run the same k-cup twice on 'small' cup setting in a large mug to dilute it slightly more to suit my taste.  Quick and convenient hot apple cider with caramel touch for those occasions when you crave apple cider, hot or cold  add ice cubes).<br /><br />***update*** noticed my keurig was spurting during brew cycle but only when using this caramel apple cider k-cup.  After making a cup of cider, i decided to cut the foil open on the top of the k-cup.  I discovered this stuff clumps during brewing inside the bottom of the cup as a sticky ball.  It has done it on the second pack as well, so might be product & not just a bad batch. Might be clogging up the discharge needle in the bottom of the k-cup.

"Since I am diabetic, I have tried every artificial sweetener on the market. For me, all of them have too much of a bitter aftertaste to be usable. I had read that xylitol is more or less a 'natural' product, and after having heard a professional chef give glowing reports of Ideal (xylitol) on a radio program, I ordered the three bulk forms of the product.<br />It tastes fine in beverages. Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute.<br />I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking. I'm very disappointed that Ideal does not perform at all well in baked goods.",Not what I was hoping for,3

"NO FEAR, as energy supplements go, is okay. Based on one can, it seemed to provide enough caffeine to fuel my typical Saturday, although a busy workday would have been a better test. (Alas, the Vine program only provides one can, so I couldn't compare.)<br /><br />It has a nice, fruity flavor, with little aftertaste. The carbonation seemed a little weak, which gives it a sort of ""watered-down"" feel.<br /><br />Like other energy drinks, NO FEAR contains taurine, an essential amino acid for felines which they get from their carnivorous diets. (In cats, a deficiency can cause blindness.) As for its health benefits in humans, the jury is still out. I'm not convinced it has any particular benefit, except that listing it as an ingredient probably increases sales.<br /><br />I only mention that because NO FEAR and other emergy-drink products tout themselves as ""health"" drinks, but that's not necessarilly true. If you buy NO FEAR, do so because of its caffeine content. NO FEAR contains about 83 mgs of caffeine per 8 ounces, which is more than Pepsi Max (69 mg) but less than a typical cup of coffee (110 mg) or black tea. NO FEAR is certainly an option if you don't like the taste of coffee or you just prefer cold, fizzy drinks.<br /><br />But maybe an extra dose of taurine in the morning will hone your catlike reflexes and allow you to attack your day like a leopard taking down a gazelle!<br /><br />Right before your six-hour nap.",You'll have more energy than....the average housecat!,3

"To give this tea a fair shot, I first brewed it exactly as the box said to, and had a cup black, as I usually drink tea.  I was underwhelmed.  There just seemed to be some kind of stale taste there---it didn't taste sharp or whatever the taste is called that I like tea to have!  It wasn't just that it was mellow, you want that in a breakfast tea a little, but it just didn't have a standout taste, and it made the bitter bit of taste not something that complemented the tea flavor, but took away from it.  Then I tried it with sugar.  I liked it a little better that way, but no better than very basic tea like Red Rose or Salada.  Finally I brewed it strong and made ice tea.  I liked it the least that way.  The flavor issues came out more with the strong and the cold, and I didn't finish my glassfull.<br /><br />I like the ideas of this tea---that they are part of the ethical tea partnership and that the box is made from recycled materials, and I will certainly use the rest of the teabags, but it is not a product I would seek out or pay extra for.","Any way I brewed it, a bit of a stale taste",3

You won't walk in to work with your mug and have people think you brought in a pet skunk.<br /><br />The taste really isn't bad at all to be quite honest.  It's not a strong cup of coffee, it even says ""Mild"" on the box, so don't expect that.<br /><br />I think when some people say that it doesn't taste like plain coffee with Kahlua in it probably haven't actually put plain Kahlua in coffee.  They've probably put one of the flavored Kahlua products in their coffee, like hazelnut or french vanilla (which is very yummy).  Plain Kahlua is just a coffee liqueur, that kinda tastes like, well, coffee.<br /><br />I only gave three stars because of the slight inconvenience of the brewing smell and because it's just too mild for me.  My wife seems to like it more than I do, but she's not really a coffee drinker, so the mildness must appeal more to her.","Not horrible, fairly decent taste",3
"This drink is spicy! It's surprising how much of a kick that ginger has, and the honey and lemon are nearly drowned out in the ginger flavor. I drank it warm, and it was a nice and soothing beverage on a cold day. I use ginger a lot for its anti-nausea effects, and I could see trying this to help combat motion sickness. That said, even watered down slightly, the kick was still a lot for me and it was rather hard to drink the entire cup in one sitting.","Spicy, but I'd rather just drink tea",3
"My husband and I are both gluten intolerant and we watch our salt.  The buns are easy to make and tasty but they are too salty.  The nutrition statement for this product is very confusing.  The package states that the box of mix will make four buns.  The nutrition statement, on the side of the package, states that a bun contains 140 mg sodium.  But, when you read the fine print, you can see that the nutrition statement is actually based on making 10 tiny buns from one package.  So, using the package to make four buns, each bun would actually contain 350 mg sodium.  For anybody watching their sodium, that's too much salt for one bun.<br /><br />Also, four not-very large buns from one box of mix is pretty expensive.<br /><br />I realized that there's not much else in this mix except tapioca (manioc) flour and salt.  You add your own wet ingredients and, optionally, cheese.<br /><br />My solution:  I found many recipes on the Web, in English, for manioc buns or pao de queijo which is the Brazilian name for manioc buns.  The recipes that I found are esentially the same as the instructions on the Chebe box.  I bought Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour (four 20 oz bags for about $12.00) from Amazon.  To use up my remaining boxes of Chebe mixes, to dilute the salt level, in a bowl, I emptied the box of Chebe mix, added the same amount of Bob's unsalted tapioca flour (2 cups), and double the amount of wet ingredients required just to make the mix.<br /><br />The resulting dough was stickier than the original Chebe mix, but the buns that I made were incredibly good.  They tasted similar to southern biscuits.  They were hot and steaming with an excellent texture.  I baked them in an ungreased stoneware pan and they did not stick to the pan.<br /><br />After I've finished my remaining the Chebe mixes, I'll attempt to make more buns by using the rest of my Bob's tapioca flour with the same proportions of wet and dry ingredients that the Chebe mix uses.<br /><br />I'm not an experienced baker - does anybody have any idea how to make my lower salt dough less sticky - more oil, more liquid, more flour?",Very High Salt Content + Expensive - I Found a Solution,3

As of the date I'm writing this, this 3.5-pound bag costs $3.71 per pound, whereas the 7-pound bag costs $3.50 per pound and the 15.5-pound bag costs $2.32 per pound.

"My 35 lb cocker loves his new treat ball. The postman brought the treat ball in the morning and the dog spent all afternoon playing with it. Because I was busy and the dog was happily occupied I failed to notice for quite a while that the Everlasting brand chicken treat that came with the toy was making nasty stains all over the beige wall-to-wall carpet in my office. I'm pretty sure my pup isn't any more slobbery than any other avidly chewing canine. But his slobber and the chicken treat combined to create a trail of ugly mustard-colored carpet stains all over the room. In addition to a bunch of spots all over the place, I found a few large stains in out-of-the-way places where my dog had settled for awhile to lick and chew away at the toy. The treat ball itself is just fine -- I have no complaints about it as a quality dog toy. But I have serious issues with the food coloring that's used in the Everlasting treats that pop into the ball. I've just used up an entire aerosol can of carpet cleaner and an hour of elbow grease to remove the stains from my carpet. After this experience I won't be buying any Everlasting brand treats to put in my pup's new chew toy. If you're going to be using this product outdoors, then the Everlast treats might be just fine. But if you're planning to let your dog play with this toy indoors, and you've got nice flooring that you care about keeping reasonably clean, it's best to avoid the Everlast treat inserts.",Beware of Carpet Stains,3

"This coffee actually tastes pretty good for a darker roast however the number of defective K-cups with seal problems can be significant.  The issue is that the seal covering the Kcup, which gets punctured to enable the drip through, seems to continually burst open during brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in your mug and quite a mess of the machine.  My wife and I have started calling these ""bursters"" as it happens quite frequently with these Emeril's Kcups.  You can clearly hear it from far away when you get a burster and I think if you were to be doing something directly over the machine (such as putting dishes away in a cabinet above it) there is a possibility of getting in contact with some of the scalding hot steam from the sudden release of the pressure when the seal breaks open.  The seal bursts right at the final peak brewing time, probably at about the last 30% of the brewing process.  The result are a lot of coffee grounds in your mug and over the machine brewing area.<br /><br />I have been buying a lot of Kcups quite frequently in bulk that past few months.  I've tried many different types of Kcups and have purchased several hundred of each, I have never had this happen to any except the Emeril ones.  This is not just an isolated incident, there a significant number of defective ones in each of the 18 count boxes.  Usually if you get a box which has a burster you are going to get quite a few in there, probably around 5 at least.<br /><br />Wherever these specific Kcups are being made, there is a clearly a problem in the manufacturing processing and quality controls checks.  I've also seen a few cases where I have gotten a Kcup that has 2 seals pressed onto it thus resulting in a broken seal right out of the box.<br /><br />The coffee actually tastes pretty good, I really like darker roasts and this is one of my favorite ones however the quality control needs to be significantly improved.  If I was paying full retail for these I would be pretty annoyed, I think I've paid full retail for these once at a premium supermarket and sure enough there were a couple bursters in that box so it is not an issue with the bulk purchases or anything like that.  As I said I've bought hundreds of other brands in bulk and have had no issues yet.",Pretty good if you don't get one with a defective seal,3

Then I took the pod and dropped it into the coffee to make it darker. Still weak. This is the same problem I have with all the pod/cup/premeasured coffees. While I do know people who drink coffee brewed like this, it's not strong enough for my taste, and I think most people's. The flavor is good, would be delicious if strong, so maybe next time I will use two pods. However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied.

Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special.

It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe.

I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it.

"My son loves Sprout Organics baby food... especially the Roasted Pear.  As it can be hard to find in stock at local stores I have tried (5 times) to order Sprout Organics from Amazon.  Unfortunately, the twelve packs come in a manufaturer's point of purchase box that only has the name of the baby food on a label and 3 of the 5 boxes I have ordered have contained expired food! And lets be real - you are not going to feed a baby expired food.<br /><br />It is very frustrating and I cannot really blame Amazon because as far as I can tell you have to open the manufacturer's box to get to the expiration information.  So - the food is great but buyer beware.  Check the expiration date because more than half of my orders have arrived to me already expired.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have never updated a review but I feel compelled to do so now.  I contacted Sprout and let them know about the expired food.  The customer service rep who I spoke with told me that I ""wasn't the first person to call them about this problem"" but they seemed to listen to the feedback and even promised to replace the food.  Unfortunately they forgot to send the replacement food so I am now 3 weeks from the date it was received in the mail... no money back... no food.<br /><br />Here is hoping next week brings me better luck.",The food is great... but don't buy it here!,3

Even though it was soaked in milk it wasn't really a cereal and it was still dry. How? I wound up drinking the milk from the bowl at the end. - fail.<br /><br />I bagged some and took it as a snack. Better. Great and crunchy. Tasty but have a drink handy - Good.<br /><br />The next morning I had Greek fat free yogurt and sprinkled some on top. It required some hands crumbling clusters but not really that much work. It added a bit of flavor to the creamy goodness that is Greek yogurt (not the other kind of tangy yogurt) and it gave it some crunch. Not thirsty after words ) the best way to have it.<br /><br />Over all if you like crunch and want to add some healthy omegas to your diet this is a good way to do it.

I made numerous cups trying to perfect the flavor and could never get it to appeal to me.  The cofee is VERY robust.  Had I followed the directions of two tablespoons per cup I might have had a heart attack!  I used less than that and it was way too strong (bitter to me), and yet the vanilla flavor was barely evident. I tried reducing it more and it was still bitter with no vanilla flavor.  The scent is mild.  I will just stick with my Dunkin Donuts brand and add vanilla creamer.

"Putting flavor on regular water really depends on one's preference.  I am curious and very intrigued with this new product that I tried the following three flavors: Peach-mango, sweet tea and peach tea.  Out of the three, I prefer sweet tea the best as it tastes closer to the real kind than peach tea and peach-mango.  Although I prefer water in its plain form, the taste is not far from ready-to-drink flavored water available commercially.  If you like those, it might worth to try as you more control in what flavor and much flavor you want to put in your water.<br /><br />Mio is very concentrated ""water enhancer"" - I never heard of those words until now.  A small bottle can be used 24 times.  The plastic bottle has a unique way of dispensing, it will not leak unless you squeeze the bottle for a squirt - one squirt, one serving, and one squirt is enough for a 6- to 8-ounce glass of water.  Of course you can squirt more it depends how squirt happy you are. The amazing thing is that even if I don't stir it, just letting it stands for 20 seconds and the flavor spreads.<br /><br />It uses the artificial sweetener called Sucralose, whose scientific name is Splenda (OK, I probably have mixed them up).

I love Cappuccino in general and I like the idea of having it in a can that you can take on the go. I had mixed feelings about the taste of illy Cappuccino though. I liked the taste for the most part but it had a funny milk taste to it. It tasted more like skim milk than low-fat milk and I just didn't care for the taste of the milk. I enjoyed drinking it but not as much as expected. Each 8.45 fluid ounce can has 100 calories which is a little more than I would expect for such a small size. For the cost of this product I would think that they could be a little more generous with the size of the drink.

After eating them, I was slightly disappointed after doing some fact checking.<br /><br />Taste-wise, these things are awesome & taste very similar to the regular product. Calorie-wise, there isn't a humongous amount of difference. With the regular pop tarts, there was only a difference of 12 calories. The fat content *is* halved in this set, but the sodium, sugar & carbohydrate levels are substantially higher in this than in the regular version.<br /><br />Bluntly put, you'd be better off diet-wise to go with the normal poptarts than to go for this option. If all you are worried about is the fat content, you are set. If you are looking at a variety of factors, you'd be better off going for the regular version.

"Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",NOT as good as the ones in the tins,3
"I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0"">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW"">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.

"I'm assuming that most people reading this review have had Maruchan brand ramen noodes before so I don't feel the need to go into much general detail. I don't eat instant noodles too often (trying to go healthier!) but I was curious about these so I grabbed a couple packs.<br /><br />I'm a fan of chili peppers in curries and was curious how this was going to work out. Overall, it was underwhelming. The noodles are the same as always but the powder was kind of weird- after cooking I left the room to go do something and when I came back it had separated.  I didn't prepare it as per package instructions (I made it in the microwave instead with less water and didn't get it to full boiling, though I still added the powder after cooking) but it still seemed weird to me.<br /><br />As far as flavor, it was a kind of bland blanket spicy taste with a hint of chili powder. The spiciness is pretty strong (which I like) but I wanted more personality to it.<br /><br />I need to look at these at the grocery store and see if the salt content is a little lower than other flavors. It tasted like it might have been, and I'd be happy to trade lower sodium for a little less flavor.<br /><br />Overall, I'd prefer pork or creamy chicken flavor.

I can grow this one outside no problem, so I would have appreciated more delicate herbs. In any event, I feel like I am really wrangling with it to keep it from shadowing the others. The parsley has failed to grow very thickly, which gives me only a little every few weeks. The biggest disappointment are the chives. Only a few sprouted, maybe enough for 1 person every few weeks. Now that I think about it, the basil and mint are the only plants that have truly grown satisfactorily.  Honestly, I would hesitate to buy this particular kit again.

"There were some surprises in this coffee for me. I made two pots, one a little stronger than the other, just so I could try it at different strength levels. Both pots conveyed the same essential characteristics. I poured cups for both myself and a coffee-loving friend, just to help ameliorate personal preferences, but we still quickly reached common conclusions with little discussion.<br /><br />First the vanilla... this brew doesn't really manifest a vanilla flavor. That aspect is more of an essence that quickly fills the room during brewing and which the nose encounters as one tastes it. I was actually expecting a significant vanilla flavor but I couldn't detect it much in the coffee itself, which was fine with me. It was a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I was quite surprised at the product page description which particularly boasts *no bitterness*, because this coffee conveys an edge like a wood rasp. I thought it was among the most bitter of all the premium gourmet coffees that I've tasted over the years. Is this due to the presence of *quakers* (underdeveloped beans which yield undesireable flavors)? I cannot say since this coffee is pre-ground. I can say that I ultimately dumped in some pre-warmed Half-and-Half to tone it back and I could still detect the bitterness, although not as prevalently.<br /><br />This brew wasn't hateful but it's not a coffee that I'd be interested in drinking in the future. But do not fail to try it based solely on what I have had to say about it.

"Chewy, ginger flavor is delightfully delicious.

"The veggie involved here is dried cauliflower replacing some of the wheat starch in the noodles.  It smells like cauliflower when boiling.  It has a very mild cauliflower taste.<br /><br />In exchange for a slightly unusual taste, the ""veggie"" version of Kraft gives you:<br />Vitamin C 15% daily value (vs. 1% in the regular version)<br />Dietary Fiber 3 grams (vs. 1.5 in the regular stuff)<br /><br />Those were the only notable differences.  An extra 1.5 grams of fiber doesn't seem like a lot, but that's 12% DV instead of 6%.  For other nutrients, such differences matter a lot less.  The veggie version has 1 gram less fat, but that's only 11 calories worth of fat shaved from a food which is already fairly low in fat, and the total calories end up being the same anyway.  There are some 1% differences in some other vitamins, which doesn't matter.<br /><br />Getting back to the taste...<br />Even though there is only a small cauliflower influence on the taste, I found that it somehow did detract from enjoyment.  Blue-box Mac&Cheese has a very mild cheese flavor, which works OK when the noodles are normal.  But the very slight added cauliflower taste kind of masks the cheese.<br /><br />If you have kids demanding it 3 times per week, a little extra fiber and vitamin C might be a good idea.  But if this is your guilty pleasure food or just a backup plan for rare occasions, I would stick with the normal stuff.<br /><br />If you want to experiment with healthier noodles, there are several brands of dry pasta with omega 3 fats and added fiber.  They do tend to have a wheaty flavor, but on the other hand they don't have that weird cauliflower taste.","Slightly weird taste, minor nutritional improvment",3

We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.,Popcorn,3
"This dish proved difficult for us, although it was simple to prepare.  The Papa Bear found it too spicy, the Baby Bear didn't like the look of it and refused to try it, and the Mama Bear (that's me) found it sweeter than the curry I usually eat. A quick read of the package says that this is in the Singaporean style, which we have never tried. That may be what made it difficult for us. I'm giving it an extra star because it is probably good when served to people familiar with Singaporean food.<br /><br />Preparing the dish was a snap, just adding the sauces in the package to sauteed beef, bell peppers and onions. However, because the sauces rendered the rest of the food inedible by most of the family, I wish I had just left the meat, peppers and onions plain, and served it to my family that way. I suggest tasting the sauces before adding to the meat, thus preventing an expensive dinner mistake.",A difficult dish for us.,3
"I really love the taste of this cereal. I went through all three of my boxes really fast. It tastes just like the treats. The only problem is the cereal gets soggy a lot faster than most cereals.

"I'm trying to judge these for what they are, which is a semi- healthy candy/snack, rather than for what I want them to be, simple granola clusters than can be a snack or cereal, so they get 3 stars instead of the 1-2  my general disappointment favors.<br /><br />With most granola clusters, you can also break them up a bit to eat as cereal or as a yogurt topping. But these are large, cohesive,  chunks held together with cocoa coating, more like ting-tings or other homemade no-bake cookies (but not as yummy because it's cocoa instead of actual chocolate). They're distinct, large clumps (most an inch or more) completely coated and glued together with a bittersweet (more bitter than sweet) cocoa coating.<br /><br />My main problem with this product (aside from the fact that it's in flavor limbo) is that the packaging/product page downplay the cocoa element, which is absolutely the defining flavor here, completely neutralizing the ""cranberry walnut"" flavor listed on the package. The picture just looks like it could be extra-toasty granola, and the label says CRANBERRY WALNUT GRANOLA CLUSTERS in large letters with ""the natural antioxidant power of cocoa"" in a little bubble off to the side. The description mentions cocoa but doesn't say the clusters are completely smothered in it, so you'd expect the stated flavor (cranberry walnut) to have at least an equal footing. Since cocoa really is the dominant flavor, the packaging or at least the Amazon title should have cocoa in the name.<br /><br />As a snack, it is nice that the clumps stay together, since crumbly clusters are always an issue with granola snacks.<br /><br />If you want kind of a hippy candy, not chocolately enough to actually taste like a treat (unless maybe you're on a low carb diet), but way too cocoa-y to make a good cereal or fruit/granola topping, then this is for you.",Large cocoa smothered clumps,3

"This is a one pound of dried Goji berries that are smaller than I am used to. It is also drier than other Gojis I tried. That could be an advantage since the product is sold by weight, you do get more product than if it was moist.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted moldy gojis in their bag and I did notice my bag having the same issues. I just picked them off.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted that in Chinatown you could get goji berries cheaper. I have gotten them in Chinatown and I noticed they came with warning that it has to be rinsed and cooked. I guess it would be good to be used in cereals or in homemade granola where you can use wet cooked gojis. In this day of instant gratification, I do not see myself reaching out and snacking on the Chinatown version of goji that I have to rinse it.<br /><br />Will I continue to get this Navitas product from Amazon ? Yes as it has been certified to be Organic and Kosher (meaning clean). The price is decent. So I can snack on them and get the nutritional benefits. Goji is said to have one of the highest concentration of Zeaxanthin, an antioxidant important for vision and it is being studied for prevention of Macular Degeneration. Note that Goji juice does not have a measurable amount of Zeaxanthin. You have to get it from dried fruit.<br /><br />I bought a container of Goji berries in a reputable Chinese Medicine Pharmacy in Beijing and that was like the best Goji berries I had. It was larger in size and they were evenly the same size. I paid nine dollars for the half pound container. I find that getting a regular shipment from Amazon to be a  tad more convenient than going to Beijing to get Goji berries.<br /><br />4-15-11 Addendum.<br /><br />I got my second bag of this product and it was a much greater improvement over the first bag I received. The berries were actually larger (just like the ones I got in Beijing!) and it was more moister. And it actually tasted sweeter. Looks like they may have gotten a different supplier and this bring closer to the premium grade. One colleague of mine who is the head of Nutrition Society for Optometrists tells me that a store in Pasadena, California sells Goji berries that are moist like raisins.

"I purchased this at the local grocery store, which is actually a chain, called Sprouts.

I was to take the bread for Bible Study Breakfast, so I bought a bag and could not wait to give it a try.<br /><br />I easily mixed it up and did (thankfully) add extra raisins though I was cautioned that I did not need to do so and popped this into the oven. (I did not have a breadmaker at the time). It smelled wonderful while baking, and looked great when it popped out of the oven. I proudly carried it over to the Breakfast, where I sliced it since it was now cool, and presented it for the attendees to sample a slice or two. Great quality butter was right beside it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNPHNA"">Kerrygold Pure Irish Butter - Unsalted (8 ounce)</a>. After slicing, I popped a small group of crumbs into my mouth expecting to savor the wonder. YEEEECH. Well, maybe not QUITE that bad, but close.<br /><br />The bread DID have some raisin flavor. Thank goodness for the extra handful of raisins. If I were to do it again, I would add two handfuls. But otherwise, it was dry and fairly tastless...Thank the good Lord for the Butter. The Butter was good enough that no one really said much about this loaf of bread.<br /><br />After the first pass and choices of goodies, I noticed, that on the second time up, people took one of my other breads:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL6X4"">Dassant Cinnamon Chip Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL71K"">Dassant Pumpkin Spice Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. So at least, I was saved from all out banishment and you KNOW that is what happens to Bible Study Ladies who cannot cook!<br /><br />So again, I do not recommend this bread as it is dry and tasteless.

"If you are not sure if you will like Shirataki this is a nice trial size package but at a premium price. Here on Amazon the multi-packs are running around three each instead of the six I am paying. If a grocery store near you has these in rice or noodle form they can be as low as two dollars. This should make two or three servings depending on the recipe.<br /><br />First, these and all current Shirataki products are packed in water. I am not sure why but that is just necessary. Shirataki noodles like these are made from the flour of a type of yam. Other companies use Shirataki and tofu flour to make noodles with a more starchy texture instead of the slippery feel of pure Shirataki. The stagnant water or fish odor when you open packages is just something you have to deal with.<br /><br />Second, rice is a severe misnomer, they are more like pearl tapioca balls or a slippery orzo pasta.<br /><br />To use: bring broth with seasonings for soup to a boil. In the sink open the package and pour the stagnant smelling water out of the package and rinse the product for half a minute or more to remove most of the odor. A wire strainer is useful here.  Add the rinsed contents of the package to the broth or water and boil for one minute. Shirataki absorbs the taste of what they are cooked in and boiling is best. The orzo-like ""rice"" should not be boiled longer than a minute or so.  After you have boiled these in a chicken or beef broth with added vegetables and seasoning and anything else you enjoy in a soup serve and you have an extremely low calorie, low carb, filling meal.<br /><br />There is a low carb Shirataki fried rice recipe with egg and bacon that sounds good, Google it, but I haven't tried that yet. I do think boiling Shirataki for a minute in broth improves the flavor enough to do that for any recipe you are considering. Some people just boil Shirataki in water and then add the Shirataki to whatever dish and cook that for a couple minutes for the Shirataki to absorb the flavors.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about Shirataki. The texture and preparation take getting used to and it may be easier to just make some spaghetti squash and have those noodles available in the refrigerator to use as an alternative. However, Shirataki noodles or ""rice"" are much lower in carbs and calories (zero!) than the low carb wheat and other grain pastas that are becoming much more common.",Trial package of Shirataki,3

"I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then.","great idea, but didn't attract players",3

"I think these must be instant coffee b/c the cups feel empty when they're done, unlike the coffee ones which feel a little heavier b/c of the grounds and filter inside. Anyway, they taste like instant coffee and hot chocolate - not the greatest combination. I would also like it to be a bit creamier. With some creamer added they are tolerable. I won't buy them again, too bad I bought 24.",Not my favourite,3
"This is the first Zevia flavor I got to try.  I didn't really want it but it was all Amazon had in stock and ready to ship for Prime members (more on that later).  I was so eager to try it I popped a can open right when I got it in the house.  My initial thought was that it was gross but I thought I could get used to it by the time I get through the entire case.  My wife tried it at room temperature and she hated it.  She didn't touch anymore orange or the black cherry I got later because of that first taste.  She's since had some nice cold root beer and cola Zevia which she was impressed with.  My nearly three year old son also had a taste test of the orange flavor.  He's not a soda drinker so maybe that had something to do with his reaction.  He drank about an 1/8 of a can which surprisingly all came back up on my kitchen floor about two minutes after he drank it.  He said he didn't like it.  Ha.  Out of the four flavors of Zevia, orange is my least favorite.  I will not be ordering it again due in part to its taste, which I would say is okay, but also the price for it.  I am willing to pay the price for now for a couple of the other flavors, but not orange.<br /><br />There are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Orange is an okay tasting soda.  I will not be purchasing any more of it even if it's all Amazon Prime has in stock.",Not as Good as Cola or Root Beer Flavors,3
"These were very nice and colorful, however, they did not package them well enough and several were broken when I received them.

I was able to put a few back together - the frosting helped - but some were too shattered. Other than this problem, I liked the product.",some were broken,3
"I'm sure these are great for other dogs but my dachshunds are garbage disposals and they eat these things in literally less than 30 seconds.

"I prefer a full body roast of coffee similar to Starbucks HOUSE BLEND or Dark Varietals - NOT PIke Place which I despise. I find Dunkin Donuts way to lightly roased for me. When I was in NOLa, I had coffee at Community and it was a darker roast and full bodied. So I ordered this blend because it said ""Medium to dark"". When Opened the first bag there was no burst of coffee flavor. I've been making it and drinking it but it tastes like the satandard Dunkin' Donuts we use when it goes on sale for $4.99/bag.<br /><br />So it's not bad, but not special either and unless I catch a darker roast on sale, I'll probably not order it again.

"I don't have a dry scalp but I do have long hair. The ends are dry so I use this oil on the ends. I've put it on both wet and dry hair. It blends well, does not feel sticky nor seem to weigh my hair down. It doesn't seem to attract dust. It also makes my finger skin nice.<br /><br />Like all oils, it makes the hair shinier, but not softer.

I used the discontinued type and have not tried the current product.<br /><br />Assuming that the ingredients on the back of the bottle are listed by percentage volume with the largest part first, I was surprised to see the first ingredient is mineral oil. The five other oils that the Amazon description cites are at the end of the list which, if my assumption is correct, means they are in very small amounts.<br /><br />Most other hair treatments such as conditioners, de-frizzers, moisturizers, arcan oil... list a version of dimethecone as their first ingredient. It makes the surface slippery and seals in moisture but doesn't add any (you will find it in hand creams too). I don't know whether dimethicone or mineral oil is more expensive so I can't say ""save your money and use mineral oil (or mayonnaise or olive oil).""

"These chips are quite literally a mixed bag.  If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips.  The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew.  The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark.  I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them.  I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers.  They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce.

"My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.

One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.

"One out of one owner-and-buyer-of-dog-treats thought they were not worth the cost.<br /><br />A few additional thoughts:<br /><br />I cannot see an ""item count"" on the package.  In the picture, the treats look like skinny pencils.  In fact, each treat is the size of four skinny pencils, with eight in the bag.<br /><br />""Cinnamon spice"" is a people-flavor.  ""Rancid road kill"" is a dog flavor.  ""rancid road kill"" does not sell well.  That said, buy treats for your dogs, if that's who will be eating them, not yourself.<br /><br />My larger dogs (70#, excellent teeth, and 30#, bad teeth) inhaled these chews, taking just a little longer than they would take to eat fresh meat.  For this price, chews have to last a bit longer.<br /><br />I do not understand how the chews could be considered ""hard"" if used straight from the package.  YMMV.  My Chihuahua took two days to eat his.  He left a mess.  The bigger dogs didn't.<br /><br />My larger, 55# and underweight, young girl dog would not touch these chews on two different days.

"Being that I am a diabetic, I love Crystal Light, usually. This mocktail of Margarita was the lone exception. The first thing that hit me upon tearing open the packet and pouring it into my pitcher was the raunchy aroma. Usually the Crystal Light smell is either pleasant or non existing. This Margarita mix smelled horrible. I went ahead and added water and shook vigorously to blend the mix well. I then tasted the concoction: not bad. It does have a nice sweetened lemonade flavor. It does not taste like a cocktail at all though. It does not taste, to me, like a virgin Margarita even, just a blandish, sweet lemonade type of flavor. Then came the gastric distress. Oh no! I drink Crystal Light every day with no ill effects; this concoction, once again, was the sole exception. I'll spare the details, but suffice to say that I am not willing to even test this mocktail again. I am back to my trusty Raspberry, Peach, or Lemon Ice Tea blend.

"I first tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MO765O"">EZ-Sweetz 2-ounce bottle)</a>, and I loved the convenience and carb savings over Splenda.  But to make a pitcher of lemonade (which is what I use it for most often), I had to use 60 drops, which got tedious.  So I decided to try this version, since it is twice as concentrated.  This has made it a lot more convenient for me, plus, with the 2-ounce bottle, I was always taken by surprise when it suddenly ran out.  With this three-pack, I know to order another box when I'm down to my last bottle.  Both versions are great, but based on those two advantages, I will probably buy this one from now on.<br /><br />In my experience, the conversion ratio for EZ-Sweetz versus sugar or Splenda in a recipe is not quite as described.  I've always had to use more Splenda than what its manufacturer says is the sugar equivalent, and with EZ-Sweetz, I have to use a little more than what they claim as the Splenda equivalent (I haven't noticed any problem with the claim of this EZ-Sweetz being twice as concentrated as the 2-ounce version; I use 30 drops now).  But still, it's such a huge savings of carbs (and even calories), it's a good product to get.<br /><br />Update 8/27/12 - The first several packages I got were very easy to dispense.  However, the past two packages I've purchased have required a much tighter squeeze to get them to drip.  If you only need one or two drops, it's not a big deal.  But when you're counting out 30 for a big pitcher of lemonade, it becomes downright *painful*.  I thought the first batch was a fluke (though it was all three bottles).  But now this batch (ordered more than a month later) is just as bad.  I've dropped my star rating as a result, and I'll be looking for different product to switch to.","Great sweetener, though overpriced and hard to dispense",3

An improvement for me would be to have it sweetened with beet sugar or agave.  I was suprised at how small the meal was and there was not enough sunbutter for the crackers.  The other thing about the sunbutter is that it says on the package you can squeeze the sunbutter out but when I did I got an ooze of oil (like the kind that sits on top of some peanut butter) yuck.  But on the positive note...the sunbutter was great tasting, much better than expected.  The crackers were great, little fruit snacks were great and 100 fruit juice sweetened.

I missed the fact that these were single serve packets which one would place in a mug and then add hot water...  As I think about it, It may be the right way to do it, to put an entire contents into a mug and brew/add hot water into the mug, I just wasn't careful enough to notice it was in packets, not K-cup product I expected.<br /><br />I was recently served a K-cup apple cider by a friend and enjoyed it, both in the novelty of using the K-cup technology, and the steamy goodness of the beverage...  I wanted to give it a try with my new machine and I was just disappointed that what arrived was packets, not K-cup.  'Gift box' was appropriate title, and I wasn't discerning enough in my evaluation of the product description.<br /><br />I post this so you may get the product you may prefer.  : )<br /><br />I trust the Mott's brand and feel the Apple Cider may be kinda a nice little 'giftee' for someone this holiday season... : )",I thought it was K-cup... whoops... it's not...,3

"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.",Mixed feelings,3
"The franks aren't the best substitute for hotdogs.  I didn't like them much and neither did any of the people in my house.  Before getting these I would highly recommend Smart Dogs, they have a much better texture and cook up a lot better.  The outer layer is a little tougher than regular hot dogs.  The best are Tofurkey sausages though.  They are much larger than hot dogs, but have a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Don",Not the best,3
"The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste. To me, the flavor was a little overwhelming. There was no turkey flavor. Just the sweetness of the Teriyaki. I think 7 grams of sugar in a 1-ounce serving (1/3 of a package) seems like a lot. And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness.

"I have two cats who are snack-motivated (the third is not, so her vote is not included), and we tried both the Salmon and the Chicken Crunch n Clean. It's a bit on the pricey side, but as anyone who has ever tried to brush their cat's teeth will tell you, anything that can lend a hand in kitty dental hygiene can be worth it. The cats didn't seem to have a preference between Chicken and Salmon, both chased and gobbled the treats immediately. There's the problem, though: whether it's the size or texture of the treats, or just down to the individual cat, only one of the two cats (same size, generally same disposition) bothered to chew. The other just swallowed it whole. I don't mind giving the cats treats, but prefer other brands for their ""junk food"".

"This product is very tricky to work with and a pain in the rear.  If you can get it cut and on the cake without tearing, it looks great, but it's very delicate work.  Buy 2 the first time you use it, because you will probably need a backup.  I cut out a VERY simple silhouette of a black cat to go on top of an orange Halloween cake and even that simple shape had to be trimmed and finessed because the edges would tear as I was cutting (I used small sharp cuticle scissors).  If you have a Cricut and lots of shapes to cut with, it's probably a lot easier, but I don't anticipate using these enough to justify the expense.  Cool concept- but I think it would work much better if the sheets were a little thicker and sturdier.<br /><br />ALSO- the black will stain your fingers and your tongue (!) when you eat it.  Kids thought it was great, hubby and me not so much.<br /><br />By the way, I DON'T recommend the pre-cut letter sheets.  The letters are small and not very well cut.  I couldn't get them off the backing without tearing them- I ended up having to pipe the letters on anyway, which I could have done in the first place much more quickly and easily.  Not worth the $4-$5.",Tricky to work with,3

It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. ""We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace"".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for.",I Love The Message!,3

"When I first popped one of these in my mouth, I was really pleased with the light caramel flavor of the hard candy outer shell. The flavor was a little more delicate than a typical <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AXEFY"">Werther's Original Hard Candies, 34-oz.</a>, but it still felt substantial. When the candy shell finally dissolved and broke, it let loose a blast of pure honey, so much so I felt like someone had pounded a beehive into my mouth. Wow! Sweet! I tried another and this time bit through the caramel shell right away. I ended up with a sticky sweet agglomeration of caramel and honey that threatened to glue my mouth shut if it didn't dissolve all my teeth first. Wow! Really sweet! If my dentist doesn't own stock in the maker of this product, he should. Doesn't matter, though, because after eating this candy, I'm probably going to be making his next three BMW payments anyway. So, I'll just say, hey, this candy is fine, but it's nothing but caramel and honey mixed together, and it can be over-powering-ly sweet. As for the pick-me-up, all I can say is, yep, that's what sugar does. And the vitamin boost? Yeah sure, but a piece of fruit or a glass a milk could probably do the same. I have to say, this is not a bad product, but it's nothing more than a semi-natural candy masquerading as something (energy boost with vitamins) that it really is not. If you love visiting your dentist, schedule an appointment before you try this candy. If you'd just as soon stay as far away from your dentist for as long as possible, I think you need to stay away from this cavity catalyst candy.",Go ahead and schedule your annual dental checkup now,3

"There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product.",This is not the way to make a cup of coffee,3

"As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.

"I will review this conditioner along with its shampoo, CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce (https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/product?ie=UTF8&asin=B007RTR8A2).  Just to let you know, I copied and pasted the review from the shampoo (which I reviewed first) and adjusted some words and the link to the shampoo.<br /><br />I received the shampoo, then the following week ordered the conditioner. I put up my other hair products, so as to allow these products a chance to prove themselves to me. I began using them both on Sunday; today is Wednesday. My hair has been very soft and manageable; it's naturally curly and has been very easy to comb through after my shower. So, I would say that I was pretty happy with the results.<br /><br />Until this morning. Something really curious happened. When I opened the shampoo bottle and turned it upside down to pour into my hand, a liquid came out that wasn't the shampoo. It was very watery. Yes, I'm positive that the bottle was closed yesterday and that nobody opened it. There was perhaps three tablespoons of this watery stuff before the shampoo came out.<br /><br />I washed my hair and reached for the conditioner - which, by the way, has its opening on the bottom of the bottle. The same thing happened! First, some type of liquid came out, then the conditioner.<br /><br />I've never had to shake a shampoo or conditioner before, so I'm not sure what happened. Either way, I won't be using it anymore.<br /><br />It did a nice job, though, except for the liquid issue.",It's OK,3

"I must have had this oil in my Amazon cart for two years, always debating if I should give it a try.  Finally I did.  I was really disappointed.  I really find this oil very average.  It does smell nice but the flavor is somewhat weak, a little bland.  I guess because of the great reviews I expected more.  I suppose for general cooking this oil would be nice, but i wouldnt use it for a salad if I wanted to impress someone.<br />By the way, if you ever want to taste a great oil, see if you can get your hands on ""Protoulis"" oil from Greece.  So far it's the best oil I have ever come across.",Really not that great...,3
"On the plus side, it seems to be all natural ingredients, no fake stuff, such as it using real vanilla beans instead of flavoring. Having said that, I still feel like the vanilla flavor is too strong, and instead of being a nice accompaniment to the coffee, it almost overpowers the coffee itself. Beyond that, it is pre-ground and the beans, vacuum sealed, seemed to be as fresh as they could possibly be (couldn't smell it before opening it, therefore nice packaging).<br /><br />For those who knows what it is, we use an Aeropress coffee maker.<br /><br />The taste definitely has that ""starbucks"" flavor, which is a little more roasted than I would prefer, but if you like starbucks coffee, this does have that taste you'll recognize.<br /><br />Honestly, even though it wasn't horrible, I'm not a huge starbucks fan and it is pre-ground coffee (I am spoiled by freshly ground coffee). However, it is better than your every day instant coffee... it may sound a little negative, but it's not what I'm intending. It's not bad coffee; just not my cup of coffee.",It's starbucks,3

"Illy Issimo Cappuccino is a new drnk for me; a brand name I had not tried until recently but one I was anxious to sample. I like cappuccino beverages and I am a regular consumer of coffee, so this beverage sounded like something suitable to my tastes.<br /><br />This cappuccino drink is a little different from what I expected. Poured from the can into a glass, it looks like chilled hot chocolate with a mocha scent. It also contains a little less volume than I would prefer. The can is only 8.45 fluid ounces in size, so it is consumed completely in a very short time.<br /><br />As for the taste, it isn't as rich as I was expecting. I wanted something a little stronger and fuller bodied- something closer to an espresso. The taste of this drink, while certainly not bad, isn't very strong. It is chocolaty and coffee- like, as expected, with a creamy, medium to light body. It tends toward the sweet side, which is also not my preference. I drink all coffee- related beverages black, so I am not used to tasting sugar with my roasted brew. In addition, the sugar flavor in this beverage is different in taste and part of the reason is because the manufacturer uses beet sugar. This is probably healthier than refined sugar, but it does result in a little different flavor that may not suit the preferences of different drinkers.<br /><br />I like a good cappuccino and this one is really not a bad selection. A few tweaks of the recipe would make it a little better, but I agree that it is very easy drinking and has enough good taste to recommend.","Light Bodied, Creamy, Easy to Drink",3

Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.

Sadly, the brand was sold several times, and they are not longer identical to the cookies we enjoyed years ago. However, they are still acceptable. The Marherites are a plain biscuit, in chocolate or vanilla. The chocolate has little cocoa and barely tastes of chocolate anymore. The texture seems heavier and doughier--less buttery. But they are not too sweet and make a good accompaniement to a cup of coffee or tea. Over time, it seems many things we had years ago have become cheapened and less tasty but these are a good, plain cookie and they look nice laid out on doilies if you are having people over for coffee.","A good, not-too-sweet cookie to go with tea or coffee",3

"It was clearly a hodgepodge of seasonal overstock thrown in a brown paper bag. The packaging was sloppy, and most of the flavors were holiday ones that I'm guessing they were trying to get rid of (Eggnog, gingerbread, pumpkin spice, etc). None were broken, and it is nice to try new flavors, I just wish it wasn't so blatantly a way to flush out seasonal product! I got these as a gift for someone with a new machine so he could try a variety of flavors, but now I'm afraid the gift will look cheap since it appears to be a post-holiday special. A plus is that none of them were broken and all were accounted for.",Seasonal overstock?,3
"I think some of the other reviewers are being a little unkind. To be honest if I had read the reviews before deciding to order I probably would have passed.

It is a little like the texture and taste of a fig Newton without the soft cookie shell, but it has a very definite strawberry flavor that I personally like. It made a great mid-afternoon snack - though I'm not sure that just one bar would constitute a meal replacement. The main drawback to the product is the price. I'd have to be convinced that there were other tangible health benefits to eating this bar in order to justify the high price at over $2 per bar.",Tasty and healthy yet pricey,3

Its not necessarily a bad thing its just something I noticed. And its kind of unfortunate that it only allows you to choose two sizes of coffee and thats it.

"After receiving these today, I once again gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.<br /><br />First, let me describe them. (The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.<br /><br />The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.<br /><br />I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.<br /><br />As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.  I only mention it as something to watch for in the event that it's a flaw in the cookie itself.",I really wanted to like these more ...,3

If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense.

"Pop Weaver popcorn is a privately owned family company in Indiana that has been around for over 80  years and is more popular than any other popcorn. They produce roughly 30 percent of the world's popcorn using a specially bred corn. Their hybrid corn is grown on the farmlands of the U.S. and Argentina. They have attempted to make their popcorn as healthy as possible. This whole grain popcorn is gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, hydrogenated oil-free, trans fats-free, GMO-free (genetically modified organisms), and Kosher certified. Real butter and dairy ingredients are used. Although this popcorn has extra butter, you will not get extremely greasy hands eating this popcorn like some other popcorn brands. A bag of Pop Weaver Microwave Popcorn can be popped in approximately two minutes, and few kernels will go unpopped. This item can be purchased at discount retailers like Wal-Mart for one-fifth the cost and has a shelf life of 18 months. A ""Freshest Before"" date can be found on each box. I gave this popcorn only three stars because I prefer the old-fashioned taste of popcorn popped in a stovetop kettle. However, if you are a big fan of microwave popcorn, I give this product two thumbs up.",The Best Microwave Popcorn?,3
"I liked the taste of this coffee but there was a problem with some of the K-cups of this brand.  Probably a half-a-dozen of this brand of K-cups did not work properly.  I would put the K-cup in the coffeemaker, close the lid on the Keurig, and press the button of the size cup I wanted to brew and it would brew about 3 Tablespoons of coffee and then stop.  Coffee grounds would be in the cup and I would open the Keurig and close the lid and try again and it just would not brew.  I tried another K-cup of this same brand and it did the same thing.  Finally I just put in a Timothy's brand K-cup and it worked just fine.  This kept happening using the Tully's K-cup- so far I've wasted six of them.  Some of them worked just fine.  It might have just been a fluke with this box of Tully's K-cups but I probably will not order this kind again.  The K-cups are too expensive to waste 1/4 of them.",Problem brewing,3

"I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors.

If you are looking for the peach flavor to be equal (or more because it is first in the title)to the mango then you'll be disappointed.  Also, using the directed amount exactly made the flavor taste a bit ""thin""; adding a couple of teaspoons to the directed amount improved the richness of the flavor but didn't change it from mango to more of a peach-mango pair.",Mostly Mango!,3

"I was always a big fan Of Gloria Jeans Raspberry chocolate beans as they made a wonderful cup of coffee and the house smelled so good just from having the beans around.  When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.

"This is the first garlic-infused olive oil I've purchased, so I can't speak to the taste comparison differences, it reminds me of a mild truffle oil; I was under the impression, however, that this was 100% extra-virgin olive oil.  It is pure olive oil AND extra-virgin olive oil mixed. My fault for not reading more carefully.  The ""pure"" olive oil is listed first on the label denoting that most of the contents is not EVOO.  I do not see Italy as the place of origin as some garlic olive oils are...this one says ""bottled by Boyajian, Inc., Canton MA,"" that's all.  The other thing that makes this a more serious problem for me is that it has a disclaimer on the label that it shares machinery w/peanut oil and wheat.  My toddler granddaughter is very allergic to dairy, eggs, and worst of all--peanuts. B/c of her dairy allergy, I use olive oils freely w/o worry as a suitable cooking substitute for dairy butter. Had I assumed that olive oils were safe for her and not read the label, I might have sent her to the hospital with this oil.  So if you have issues w/these 2 food allergies, beware.

"Lots of people don't care for the Starbucks roasts, but I happen to really enjoy them. This coffee has the standard Starbucks ""taste"" to it, so if you are one that does not care for the roasts in their stores, you probably would not enjoy this coffee, either.<br /><br />What I did not care for in this coffee was the strong vanilla syrupy smell. The aroma alone was a little strong for my liking and left that syrupy smell in my house for most of the day after brewing. A little could have been nice, but it was overly sweet. Compared to the smell, the vanilla infusion did not have as overwhelming a flavor, but my palate would still have prefered more subtlety in flavoring . If you are sensitive to strong sweet smells, you might also find this unpleasant. I think the smell impeded my ability to enjoy the taste, and may contribute to my ho-hum impression of this product.",Not too far off the standard vanilla flavored coffee,3
"I drink my coffee strong.  The 3 ounce sample I received of this product wasn't nearly enough quantity for me to give it a real taste test, as I use twice that amount of coffee to make my morning brew.  Keep that in mind if you also drink your coffee strong: the 3 ounce packets are small.<br /><br />I am a Folgers fan.  It has a full-bodied flavor that is rich and satisfying to me.  So I am comparing Puroast Low Acid Coffee to Folgers, and the Puroast Low Acid Coffee failed miserably.  I found Puroast coffee thin and weak with some bitterness.  There is a mild espresso flavor that is similar to Turkish coffee I have had.  Bitter and unpleasant, but weak at the same time.<br /><br />I have had acid reflux (GERD) in the past and drinking regular coffee does exacerbate the condition.  This low acid coffee is made for people with acid reflux conditions so severe that they have had to stop drinking their morning coffee, and I applaud the fact that any coffee company has addressed the issue.  At the same time, the price is prohibitive.  10 tiny 3 ounce bags for $24?  If you make one pot every morning, that $72 a month!  For that cost, I would suggest buying acid reducer pills, and taking one before you drink your morning coffee, and to try to eat something bland while drinking your coffee, to give your stomach something to do with all the acid it is creating.<br /><br />Or, if you only have acid reflux in the morning and you think it's the coffee you are drinking, be aware that it could be caused by some medications you are taking, like calcium or vitamin pills.  In fact, any large pill can sit in your stomach and cause your stomach to create a lot of acid trying to break it down.  A recommendation is to either take more frequent smaller doses of the vitamin supplement, or stop them all together and cut out the acid reflux entirely.  Or add acid reducer medication and put up with it.<br /><br />Two or three sips of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and it's down the drain.  It's giving me acid reflux just talking about it.",Like watered down & weak Turkish coffee,3

There was no steeping involved:  the instructions simply stated to add boiling water and then to serve immediately.

"I like to choose protein bars as a nutrition-dense breakfast option. I tried the Carrot Cake flavor earlier this week and liked it (really does taste like Carrot Cake!), so I thought I would try this flavor as well.<br /><br />The Oatmeal Raisin Walnut Clif bar had more sugar than I normally would have like in a bar (20 grams, or about 4 teaspoons).  However, the rest of the bar's nutritional profile was decent: 10 grams of protein (although a bit more would've been nice to offset the 43 grams of carbs), 5 grams of fiber (excellent!), and 5 grams of fat (1 gram saturated).<br /><br />Regarding the taste, this bar wasn't nearly as good as the Carrot Cake version.  It is dense and chewy, and it wasn't bad, it just didn't have much of an oatmeal raisin taste to it at all (there was a slight walnut flavor).  On the plus side, the ingredients for this bar are mostly natural, including plenty of soy (of course, this might be a negative for someone trying to avoid soy products), rolled oats, raisins, and walnuts.  In the end, though, I probably wouldn't buy this bar again.<br /><br />One final note:  after I ate the Carrot Cake Clif bar earlier this week, I felt rather dizzy and sick to my stomach about an hour later.  I thought this was just a fluke, but the same thing happened today when I tried the Oatmeal Raisin Clif bar.  My blood pressure tends to run low, and I don't know if there is some ingredient in these bars that is somehow interacting with it; it's odd because I don't usually have food sensitivities, but I just thought that I would mention it.",Definitely have had better oatmeal raisin flavored bars,3

But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math.<br /><br />The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal.  So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon.  So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says.  They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag!

"It totally makes sense that dogs are carnivorous so we should be feeding them a meat type diet.  However, one must look at what their dog was bred for.  Many of the toy breeds were bred to be companions and fed foods from their owners plates and pantries, so the meat theory doesn't really apply to such breeds.  Such was the case with my Scottish Terrier/Chihuahua mix.  I was all for the meat theory and tried to feed her this food but her little stomach just couldn't handle so much protein.  It just seemed too rich for her.  Also, her breath began to smell terrible!  I've switched to another all natural/fit for human consumption type of dry puppy food and her stomach and system are back to normal.  That being said, my daughter has an Airdale Terrier and feeds her the regular Innova dog food, is very pleased, and would never use anything else.

"Yes, I am reviewing water.  I know, life does not get much sillier than that, but I was curious as to the claims that I have been hearing about Kangan water and now what is being offered bottled by a different company.<br /><br />In our community, there is a woman that is toting the benefits of antioxidizing, alkalizing, detoxifying and hydrating by using a machine that changes neutral tap water to alkalized 9.0 water.  All right, I will admit that I took the sample bait.  I did not feel a difference.  When the bottled version became available, I thought why not, what does this product have to offer.<br /><br />It tastes like water.  No cleaner or fresher than what comes out of the tap.<br /><br />Going back to the $4,000 machine version, the sales person said that water will return to its neutral state within 48 hours and you can test it yourself with simple testing sheets, so that is why you need to own a machine.

I was impressed with all of the good reviews and so I decided that if I could find it for cheaper at my local grocery store then I would try it out.

To me it tasted a little like non-fat instant chocolate pudding with soggy Wheaties mixed it. It was that consistency too. In fact, I'm not convinced that I'd be able to pass a taste test between the two. I was really hungry which usually makes me much more willing to accept tastes that I might not otherwise like, but even after not having anything to eat all day I still just picked at this and eventually dumped the bowl out and went hungry. I should also say that I followed the microwave directions and not the stove-top ones, so you might have better luck that way. I gave it three stars because as I said before, I'm not a big oatmeal fan and so that could have effected my judgement. It looks like other people liked it really well so if you're an oatmeal lover then this might be worth a try, but if, like me, you have so-so feelings about oatmeal in general, then I don't think this will change your mind. I will say that the original oatmeal I tried by Better Oats was the Oat Revolution! Apples & Cinnamon flavor  and it was delicious.",Blech,3

"These are interesting.  You open the packet, rinse them off and then throw them in boiling water for just a few minutes.  The texture is slightly diffent, and they taste like absolutely NOTHING, so you need to get creative.  They will take on the flavors of whatever you cook them in, so, if you are a creative cook, they can be a great alternative to dishes where you may use pasta.  The ""Rice"" is more like a pastina, so they work well for soups.  The ""angel hair"" is my favorite though.  I make a lot of stir fry dishes, so these are great to throw in, and as stated, they will take on the flavor of the oils and spices.  If you are trying to consume less carbs, these can be helpful, but don't expect a taste and texture of semolina pasta.  Also, they have absolutely no nutritional value, so they are strickly just a filler.

"I love these bags already.  I have been using them for about a week and am in love with the product.  I had been using the lansinoh and medela bags.  I love the medela because you can pump right into them but I find them very expensive. I needed an alternative.  I took a chance and chose these bags.  I like them because they hold 6 oz of milk, are biodegradable, tamper resistant and have an easy pour spout.  The only thing they need is to have an adapter so that you can pump directly into the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/12/11<br />I happened to get to the last few bags in one of my boxes of 25 (out of 75) and noticed several pin sized holes in the bottom of at least 3 bags.  I discovered the holes because I added milk to the bag and noticed milk at the bottom, I wiped it away and noticed the drop kept coming back.  When i squeezed the bag to determine where the hole was I noticed 4 small holes in the bottom. i poured the milk into another bag and the same thing happened.  Tried it again and it happened.  I poured the milk in a bottle and put it in the fridge.  I've decided to stop using these temporarily as I can't afford to waste milk.  I was so excited about this product now I'm sad.

"I brought this ready-to-eat meal to work with me yesterday for lunch. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Nothing was really terrible, rotten, or all that off-putting. It just wasn't good. My friend and I had joked while waiting for this to arrive that it was an ""adult lunchable"". If you've never had a lunchable, the idea is a little packet of ingredients the kid can put together in his own way, e.g. pizza or cracker sandwiches. They were always very bland and the idea sounded better than it actually tasted. These ended up being exactly the same way.<br />The Late July crackers are tasty (similar to a Ritz), and the salmon spread is alright. I did eat most of it, so it must have been somewhat appealing, though I couldn't tell you how. It was VERY fishy, which I don't mind, though others might.<br />The dry roasted edamame beans are so bland, I can't imagine eating them in any other capacity. Just pure salt and not much other flavor. A bit like eating those styrofoam packing peanuts.<br />The fruit and nut mixture was pretty good, though the number of banana chips was disappointingly low (two in the whole bag). The ginger peanuts were a strange new taste that I couldn't quite get into, but they were tasty.<br />By the time I got to the chocolate I was tired of trying these strangely bland foods. It's dark chocolate. Not much you can screw up there.<br />If you're in a hurry or if you're trying to get your kid to eat better (whole box is 410 calories), these are decent in a pinch.

"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.

"I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon.

"Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack.",Instant Oatmeal is Now a Staple,3

I thought it would be nice to feed her something wholesome, organic and healthy from time to time, so we tried the Raw Boost Bites. She didn't like it. Nibbled a bit on it and then spewed it out in disgust. We had more success with the customary tuna fish and ham diet.<br />I have to admit that the sample size of one is not really representative, so I have no idea whether this cat has a special taste, or whether this product is just not what cats want. I may need to try it myself to get a better idea about it ...",Neighbor's cat don't like it,3

"I have noooo idea what the ""blech"" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.",Regular tortilla chips.

"No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards.","Its cheap, but it has too much added flavoring",3
"I have to say that I have tried all kinds of expensive catfood for my grown cat.  He does not like the good stuff!  He prefers the cheap stuff so I have just adjusted to that.

"I was expecting some ""serious flavor"" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.","Pretty good, but prefer other jalapeno chips",3
The berry flavors permeate and dominate the other fruit flavors.  The bottom of the bag has dried fruit powder that sticks and stains your fingers and anything else you touch.  Think Cheetos.  Definitely will not be ordering again.,Messy Stack,3

"Alright so this is a pretty lame review, I'll admit, but I can't find a lot to say about Essentia Drinking Water. It doesn't taste bad so that's something. It doesn't really taste like anything that I could pick up. Water is water. I'm sure if you did a blind taste test between Essentia and a couple other brands of bottled water there might be some difference but as is it is pretty...watery? So don't buy it for its taste but at the same time don't NOT buy it for its taste.<br /><br />If you're purchasing Essentia is is probably for the ""health benefits."" So if that is something important to you (not a real concern to me) then you might want to consider purchasing this but do your research first. Apparently health claims are unverified.<br /><br />I can't really imagine a reason for spending $30 for bottled water but hey, different strokes for different folks.",Tastes Like Water...What More Is There To Say?,3
"These people who are picky about chocolate cake actually LIKED this? For me a really good chocolate cake needs to be moist and tasty on its own without relying on frosting. This does not fit the bill. I give it three stars because it is reasonably moist, and the consistency is not bad. It actually rises a good amount while baking. There's no graininess that I often get from gluten free products. However there is very little flavor. I am not a sugar fiend at all. I find most commercial cookies and chocolates to be way too sweet. I eat 70% cocoa mass dark chocolate with very little sugar in it. This cake does not have enough sugar or chocolate in it for me to rate it any higher. On its own, it tastes like cardboard. However, when I poured some chocolate sauce and caramel onto it, it was great! I guess this cake will be pretty good if you add frosting, but I'm not in the habit of putting frosting on everything. A good cake should be tasty on its own.",Tastes a bit like cardboard,3
"I tried this product while hiking Mount Whitney - you need good hydration while hiking and the electrolytes are a plus too.  Now I only had one bottle with me on the 20 mile hike so my experience is limited and the weather was perfect for hiking (i.e. not hot but very warm)<br /><br />The following is from the product page:<br /><br />""Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.""<br />- The perfect water has no taste and this had a slight bitter taste<br /><br />""Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.""<br />- On the trail, this water lasted a long time.  Therefore, I must assume that the hydration claim is valid<br /><br />""Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.""<br />-This of course is virtually impossible to evaluate<br /><br />""It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more.""<br />-Again, this is virtually impossible to evaluate.<br /><br />I would guess that if you are just looking for drinking water, this is a waste of money but if you are looking for water to drink while exercising or other physical activity where hydration is very important this might be worth looking into.",It's water,3

My entire family used to eat only Basic4. For last 8-12 months we tried few different ones but again ordered this from Amazon. It didn't taste as good as before.

"Competing with a company like Starbucks must be different.  To succeed, you either need to be creative enough to stand out or of such a high quality, you can gain traction.  Illycaff&egrave;, the Italian coffee company that created this product, is actually decades older than Starbucks.  However, they're relatively new (since 2009) to producing the single-serving canned beverages known as ""Illy Issimo.""  One thing that's for sure, if you're going to compete with a giant like Starbucks, it helps to have a giant of a partner.  Illycaff&egrave; has Coca-Cola, so we can call it a fair fight.  There are five different flavours of the Illy Issimo canned coffees: Caffe, Sugar-Free Caffe, Cappuccino, Mochaccino, and Latte Macchiato.<br /><br />The first flavour I decided to try was the classic Cappuccino.  Here's a breakdown of the elements:<br /><br />Smell: Dull, unappetizing, with only hints of a Cappuccino aroma.<br /><br />Taste: Quite the same as the smell.  It's not a vibrant Cappuccino taste and, though brewed with Arabica, the coffee flavour is just not strong enough.  The aftertaste, also, isn't very good.  It really can't compete with the Starbucks canned & bottle releases.<br /><br />Nutrition: 100 calories and 18g of sugar is not that bad for a full coffee drink like this.  However, if you again compare it to the Starbucks Frappuccinos, it's not a big enough difference to warrant the nutrition difference.  The Frappuccinos contain only 50 more calories and 8g of sugar, but keep in mind the Starbucks bottle contains quite a bit more than these cans.<br /><br />Overall, while this Illy Issimo Cappuccino drink is convenient, the taste just isn't nearly good enough to compete with the at-home Starbucks releases.<br /><br />-AP3-",Mediocre.  Can't compare to Starbucks Frappuccinos.,3
"I thought I finally found a toy that would last for hours with my doberman and pit bull.  The first time I gave them the everlasting treat ball it did take a few hours for them to figure it out which was fantastic, but now they know how to pop the treat out within 5 to 10 minutes!!

"This coffee is okay but I am unable to detect any vanilla flavor either before or after brewing.  I also found the coffee to taste a little more bitter than most coffee blends.  Despite this, it smells like typical coffee during brewing (which is very nice) and makes an average cup of coffee as if  you bought the unflavored variety.  I also had my boyfriend try this who is a heavy coffee drinker and he agrees with this assessment.

"OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)",An Acquired Taste,3
"I must have somehow ""missed"" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.",Not bad,3

"I grew up with this kind of relish in Massachusetts.

Love the caramel flavor and texture. Had high hopes for this product as my cholesterol is extremely high and I cannot tolerate the statins in normal medications. Used the butter for about three weeks before the chews. Extremely expensive but does it work? After about a week on the chews I noticed that my stomach was not feeling normal.

Well, imagine someone took your beef jerky, ground it up, put some sauce in with it, and then molded it into little circles of meat.  This doesn't have the chew of real jerky, so it's pretty easy to work your way through a bag without noticing.

"I often purchase and eat cereal bars to have as snacks pre-workout or in lieu of breakfast.  While I am not concerned with low-calorie options, those who are should note these are only 100 calories -- alas they are smaller-sized than a typical bar.  Not terribly filling either, so if you are looking for a more dense or higher protein bar (only 2g protein/serving), this may not be the best bar for you.<br /><br />I have to agree with two other reviewers on the dryness of the Stila Cookie Bar, as well as the comment of these resembling a ""grown up Pop Tart"".  The cookie part of the name seems a little bit of a misnomer.  I was expecting a softer texture and a little more fruit flavor in the middle.  The filling was very thin and didn't pack as much of a punch as I would like.<br /><br />Nutritionally, these get high marks for being 0g trans fat, no cholesterol, 0.5g saturated fat.  There's not much here in the way of protein as mentioned, nor fiber (2g).  As for the ingredients, high fructose corn syrup is at the top of the list.

"Melitta is the sort of coffee you'd often find in a gift basket from a nicer department store or housewares store, and for good reason. The packaging is nice, the aroma is decent, and the coffee is so middle-of-the-road that it's likely to be well-received by just about anyone used to pre-ground national brands.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor tastes artificial, but isn't overpowering. The coffee itself is, again, a true medium roast. Light drinkers will probably go ""Ooh! That's a little strong."" while dark drinkers will probably say ""Well, at least it's not watery.""<br /><br />So, as part of a gift, you really can't go wrong (unless the recipient is a strict decaf person), but keeping it around regularly doesn't make much sense to me.

"The closest description I can think of for this product is any organic nut butter.  The oil separates & sits on top of the flesh.  Two difference are this needs to be rather warm in order to mix the oil back into the flesh.  Once you accomplish this task, it will re-separate in 24 hours.<br /><br />After leaving this to warm overnight on my electric space heater, I opened it up & prepared to stir it.  This was a messy affair & I tired of it quickly.  I scooped everything out of those horrible plastic containers & plopped it all into a glass mason jar.  I then got out my hand held immersion blender & proceeded to blend.  This took some time & initially the end result was worth it.  It was smooth & creamy dreamy!  I added a bit to my morning oatmeal & the flavor was amazing.  Surprisingly it did not add a coconut flavor, it created a buttery flavor.  I was impressed.<br /><br />I patted myself on the back too soon when by the next (keeping it warm on my space heater so I could use it as it is like a rock cool) the oil already separated from the flesh. I am accustomed to dealing with real food.  You know food - stuff that doesn't have a bunch of crap added to it.  I grow, raise & grind my own.  I buy organic & only organic.  My point?  This stuff was even more work than I wanted to deal with!<br /><br />My next attempt was to make an icing replacing butter with the coconut.  Oh my! Delicious!  All I did was combine organic confectioners sugar with the coconut & mix it with my hand mixer.  It turned out creamy with a light coconut flavor.  I loved it!  I put it in the refrigerator & then worried that it would turn hard as a rock.  Not so, it was simply perfect!<br /><br />My last attempt, I tried to recreate my icing.  I guess my house was too cold.  What a mess.  Eventually the bulb went off in my head to put the mixing bowl on the stove to warm it while using the hand mixer.  This did the job.  The next day I decided to enjoy some more coco-nutty icing & I just hated it.  Not sure why exactly.  It didn't turn out exactly the same as the first amazing batch.  I can't put my finger on what turned me off so badly but that is it for me.<br /><br />I am sticking with coconut butter & coconut oil.  This stuff is simply too much work & I can get the results I desire using either of the just mentioned forms of coconut with a heck of a lot less work.<br /><br />I removed a star for the plastic packaging.  What makes it worse is the need to keep this warm for use.  At the very least, get this stuff out of the plastic & into glass pronto for your healths sake!  If you love this type of whole coconut puree, try Wilderness Family Naturals.  They sell the exact same stuff in glass!  You can find them on Amazon & they have their own website.<br /><br />I removed a second star for the difficulty to use & my sudden dislike.  Excluding the chemicals that leach into the coconut, the only ingredient is whole coconut & it is Organic.  Vegans, this is a great alternative to butter on your toast, veggies & more!  It is way better than the fake stuff marketed as food to Vegans.",I Prefer Other Forms of Coconut Over This,3

They didn't have the fizz or bite is what I call it as they did when I was a child. My grandchildren will drink them but they add them as flavoring to Sprite or 7up. They are just OK not what I remembered them to be. I would suggest buying just one pack of these and, if you like them then maybe buying the bigger packages.",Fizzies Review,3

"I ordered $35+ of product to qualify for the free gift. I added the promotion code during checkout. Needless to say, I was confused when everything BUT the free gift arrived.

As per the instructions on Amazon,  you would have needed to put them in your cart and use the promotion code.  Promotions are not automatically applied. I apologize for any confusion.""<br /><br />So there you have it. Unless you clicked on the box that says ""here's how"", you would never know you needed more than just the promotion code to get the free gift.

"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G"">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee.","Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water",3
"I found the coffee in a single serving pod to be pretty weak for an 8 oz cup.  Since I don't have this style of coffee maker, I opened the pods and poured them directly into the coffee filters I normally use to make coffee.  Two packages makes a pretty tasty, full bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this product was the incredible amount of packaging for very little product.  15 small pouches of coffee, wrapped up like tea bags, each one individually packaged in a foil packet which are all placed in a fairly large box.  The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of ""fair trade,"" ""ethical treatment of farm workers,"" ""biodiversity"" and ""sustainable cultivation"" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it's hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company's declaration of ""we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial,"" sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.  How pure can it really be after it has gone through this much processing?","OK Coffee - Wasteful, Escessive Packaging",3

"We have a bit of a dispute over these bars in my house, so I can say with some authority that they are right for some people, not for others.  At 54% cocoa, these are darker than milk chocolate but much more mild than many of the dark chocolates you can get.  I personally found them lighter than I like in a dark chocolate and a little waxy.<br /><br />On the other hand, my daughter is a huge fan of dark chocolate, and gives this the thumbs up.  If you like your dark chocolate on the light side, you may like these too.<br /><br />At 2.25 ounces, these are about the total size of a retail candy bar, and a smidgen bigger than some.

For those into that sort of thing, they're made from organic ingredients and support Paul Newman's charitable works.",The lighter side of dark chocolate,3
"What I mean by its neither here nor there is that it is somewhere in between a dark and a milk chocolate. The result is that it lacks the intensity, bitterness and depth of dark chocolate yet is slightly creamier, yet it also lacks the smoothness and sweetness of a milk chocolate. So it really is not my favorite at all. Plus, it has a strange aftertaste that I have difficulty describing. All in all, its very decent and much better than an ordinary Hershey's bar yet is just not satisfying enough that I would want to get it again. I do appreciate the fact it is organic and like the size and thickness of the bar, but I just didn't enjoy it that much.",Neither Here Nor There,3

"It's not entirely obvious from the photos here on Amazon but these 7 ounce packages aren't like normal pasta, they're basically ""precooked"" noodles that are in bags filled with water so the actual quantity of noodles is maybe a small scoop per pricey bag. The noodles themselves have a texture that's (naturally) better suited to asian style noodle dishes (i.e. a ramen bowl) and upon initially opening the package there is definitely a vaguely fish-like scent-it's not a horrible pungent scent but more reminiscent of noodles just cooked in fish soup (really hard to describe to be honest). Thankfully this does go away nicely after rinsing and blanching per the instructions, and even when eaten with just red pasta sauce there weren't any weird flavors but the textures just didn't really feel at home here.<br />Honestly these noodles would feel most at home in making a low carb ramen noodle bowl or something similar, but the real reason I'm not going to buy these again is simply that the price is insane for the quantity you get.",Expensive diet!,3

"We're pretty rabid coffee and hot chocolate drinkers at my house.  The Maxwell House International products aren't something we normally buy, but I figured this could be a really nice alternative to the coffee pods in hurry.  Sadly, the Peppermint Mocha Latte experiences left us a bit wanting.<br /><br />First and foremost, the flavor of the Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte isn't bad; however, at the recommended amount of powder to water (4 tsp per 8 oz of water) the flavor is really, really subtle.  I would not recommmend using their recommended amount of powder unless you're looking for something more akin to a tea.<br /><br />When we upped the ratio of powder to water, the product was much better.  The flavors of the peppermint weren't overpowering, and you still get the flavor of the latte coming through just fine.<br /><br />Overall, it's a middling product.  It isn't bad at all, but I think there are better mixes out there if you're really looking for a nice flavor experience.",A Bit Light on Flavor,3

This small biscuit, which you can see visible rolled oats in, prides itself on being oven-baked, with high-quality natural ingredients.

"Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal doesn't come packaged as a kids' breakfast item, but it sure was a hit with the under-10 crowd in my house.  One bowl revealed the reason why:  it bears a striking resemblance to Frosted Flakes.  The crunchy nut aspect of the cereal comes from tiny nut bits on the flakes themselves, not from any sort of separate clusters.  For that reason, their appearance is actually hit-or-miss from bite to bite.  However, that sweetness is in every spoonful, and if you're not searching for a lot of that flavor, then this may not be the cereal for you.  It's strange to me that the box gives the impression of a wholesome, possibly even healthy cereal and yet the taste is pure kids' Saturday morning treat.","Sweet - Very, Very Sweet",3

"""What's not to like about an energy drink that comes in a black can with a cracked skull with wings and the words ""NO FEAR"" emblazoned across the top, right? Well...<br /><br />It tastes sort of like carbonated strawberry or grape, a slight pucker-inducing dull fruity taste. Not bad, just not delicious. It's sort of par for the course when it comes to energy drinks. If you like Monster, Amp or Red Bull, this should be just fine. If you drink your coffee black, this will be a huge improvement unless you just love that mud-like taste.<br /><br />As far as energy, this has about the same effect on me as the Monster and Amp line of energy drinks: it gives me a subtle energy boost, and that's a good thing. Red Bull leaves me feeling wired and edgy and I don't want to waste the extra kick by sitting around vibrating, feeling restless and hating how my skin feels like it's crawling. The caffeine in a can of this is on the low end of an average cup of coffee, but it's also loaded up with taurine, l-carnitine and arginine, as well as things like vitamins B and C--things that seem to have some other potential health benefits other than just getting me through an afternoon energy slump (assuming there's enough of those things in there to be useful).<br /><br />Overall, I give this 3 stars. It does the job, doesn't taste unpleasant or leave a nasty after-taste, and falls within the price range I'm accustomed to with other similar energy drinks. It doesn't stand out as being better than other energy drinks I've tried, though, but would have earned an extra star if it tasted a bit better.","Does the job, but doesn't stand out as better than other energy drinks",3

I guess my advice is the product is fine if you like the flavor combination, but I would advise trying the mix in a small packet to determine whether or not it's for you.

I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button.

The chocolate bits sink to the bottom and so while you can keep your ratio nicely proportional by making sure to scoop the bottom, if you're not paying attention you can end up with a bunch of little chocolate bars.<br /><br />So while it tastes good, it's not good enough for me to want to buy it regularly.","""Just OK"" about sums it up",3

"I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account.",Dented Cans AGAIN!,3
"Tastes just like coconut milk and curry powder with a few simple spices. One reviewer observed that the potatoes in this recipe closely resemble tator tots. She is absolutely right.

"So far from Amazon for smoothie mixes, I have purchased this, the Zola acai product, and Big Train Fruit Tea Smoothie Blast Wild Berry.  The Zola was my favorite product, I order it multiple times, but alas it is discontinued by them now.  Big Train is not bad.  This one ... it has a different consistency and taste than the other two, more like a sweet, thin syrup, than any kind of actual fruit product, compared to the other two.  Kind of like the difference between fruit punch and ""nectar"" for juices.  This makes a sweeter, but less ""real fruity & not artificial tasting"" smoothie.  That may appeal to some, but it doesn't to me, so my rating reflect my personal opinion.  But conversely I have upped the review by adding one star to reflect that this mix was cheaper (per volume) than the other mixes I've tried, so my expectations should maybe be lower.",Meh,3
"I give it credit for being organic but the flavor is off. I got the strawberry and I don't think it tastes like strawberry at all, maybe it's just me but I found that I don't really care for the flavor.

"I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't.

"I LOVE Velveta but stopped eating 9 years ago when we switched to a healthy diet.  My kids, especially one of them in particular, loves mac n cheese, and that same mac n cheese addict also loves broccoli, so I thought this was a no brainer.  My husband and I liked the flavor, but the kids hated it.  I was expecting basically Velveta shells and cheese with broccoli and chicken and instead was flavored with chicken broth and less a mac n cheese than something else I guess.  This is most likely why the kids did not like it.  The ""pasta"" was small little rice sized/shaped pasta, forget what it is called, but I prefer larger pasta than that.  The broccoli was non-existent, it was a tiny packet of freeze dried broccoli ""florets"" that only added little green flecks to the meal, poorly done Kraft.  This product is high in sodium and calories and has many ingredients with hidden MSG in them (anything hydrolyzed or autolyzed and anythign that says ""protein extract"" or yeast extract) and it does not give anyone any vegetables.

"This cereal is very healthy (lots of fiber) but it sure doesn't taste very good! I don't understand the people who rave about the taste, maybe they've never tried a great tasting cereal before? Pretty much any cereal out there tastes better. Don't get me wrong, this is probably one of the healthiest cereal out there and one of the few that has Psyllium in it, but it sure doesn't taste very good. The cereal is all uniform ""pellets"", not crunchy at all.<br /><br />If you want to try good tasting cereal then give Bob's Red Mill's Honey Oatmeal cereal a try. That tastes 10 times better and is probably as healty as this one.<br /><br />If you're trying to solve digestive problems (that's probably why you consider a cereal with Psyllium in the first place), then try some ""Organic Smooth Move"" tea with Senna leafs. That helps with constipation issues.<br /><br />Bottom line, this cereal gets 10/10 for health, but 3/10 for taste. Before you buy the 6-pack based on all the raving reviews, make sure you buy one package first, to see if you like the taste. I pretty much wasted $24.

"I received this item through the Amazon Vine Program.  My overall impression of this tea is that it is alright, but nothing to get excited about.  Let me be more specific:<br /><br />The predominate flavor that comes through is Hibiscus, which makes sense since it is the number one item in the list of ingredients (ingredients are listed from the largest concentration to the lowest concentration in the product).  If you are a fan of hibiscus, this will not bother you.  The blackberry is in there, but I have a very difficult time finding any vanilla flavor.  No where in the list of ingredients is vanilla listed.<br /><br />The tea bag is unique, but I am not sure that it really adds anything.  In fact, it seems to take a bit away in the aspect that it does not appear to be a recyclable material.  Paper composts well, but I am not sure about the material that this weave is made from. There is no indication on the package as to what is being used. As for brewing, I do not find that this bag allows it to brew any faster or better than any of the bags that I have used on other products, including ones from Lipton.<br /><br />While this is an ok tea, I do not find anything in it to make me want to recommend it to anyone.",Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea,3

The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.

"A friend sent these to me.  I had been eyeing them on Amazon and other sites and wondering if they were any good, since I get tired of baking everything for myself.  This morning I decided to open them up and give them a go.<br /><br />I was surprised first to find that the cookies were packaged in 2s, each sort of glued to each other in a plastic bin.  I removed two cookies and pried one off of the other.  They were browner than the picture on the front.  And kind of sticky.<br /><br />When I first bit into one, the flavor was good.  It was cinnamony, and that's usually all I need.  I really love cinnamon.  But after that, the other flavors came in.  Something bitter.  Something like raisins (must be the dates).  The texture was fine--like a Lara Bar, I suppose--and I had no issue with that.  Yes, it's a little grainy, but after a while of eating wheat and gluten free products, you understand that you're sacrificing texture in most cases.<br /><br />The flavor is ho-hum.  If you want a snickerdoodle, I'd agree with another reviewer and say you're better off just making your own.  This isn't quite a snickerdoodle.  It's more like a cinnamon oatmeal cookie, or something with brown sugar or molasses in it.  The flavor is very dark and a bit heavy.  But if you're looking for something fast and simple and cinnamon, then this is a godsend.  I personally hate it when cookies use raisins or things like raisins to flavor them (I can always taste it), but it wasn't so overpoweringly awful in this case.<br /><br />I give this product three stars for being decent and edible.",A Little Good,3

"I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it.

These are advertised online as ""contains no high fructose corn syrup"" and the list of ingredients did not contain corn syrup (they were listed as ""Glucose syrup; sugar; modified corn starch; Acidulants: malic acid, citric acid; Gelling agent: Gellan; flavours; Acidity regulator: trisodium citrate; Concentrates of fruits and plants (orange, elderberry, lemon, aronia, black currant, apple, kiwi, spinach, nettle); elderberry extract; fructose; invert sugar syrup."")<br /><br />When I ripped open the first package, the first bite was amazing, but the constancy seemed to be too perfect, so I immediately checked the ingredients.  Imagine my surprise to see that the very first ingredient listed was . . . drumroll please . . . CORN SYRUP. While I know that some might argue that corn syrup and high fructose syrup are distinct, the fact remains that corn syrup was not listed on the website, and that taken along with the ""no high fructose corn syrup"" would imply that there was no corn syrup in the candy.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, the candies were actually pretty good, but don't think that you are getting corn syrup free candies.  Also be aware that there are 2.9 servings per package, so it's going to be 350 calories if you down the entire package (which is easy to do, as the candies are pretty big and there aren't very many per package). If you just want some good candies, go for it, but don't be misled like I was.",NOT Corn Syrup Free!,3
"You might think that this product, LIBBY'S PUMPKIN PIE MIX, is the same as the pumpkin that Libby produces as their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZYFKQ"">Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin</a>, with maybe spices added.  NOT SO.<br /><br />I don't know what they did, but the nutrient count is different.  The regular pumpkin has 300% of daily requirements for Vitamin A, and 2% of Vitamin C and Calcium.  The Pie Mix has only 90% of Vitamin A; and no measurable Vitamin C.  Calcium remains the same.<br /><br />Other differences are that there are over twice as many Carbs in the Pie Mix, and 2 grams less Fiber and 1 gram less Protein.  Iron is the same in both products.  There is also no Vitamin E in the Pie Mix.<br /><br />In my opinion the Pie Mix is not a bad product, it's just an inferior one.  And while it's not a big deal that I accidentally chose the wrong Libby's product, I don't intend to buy the Pie Mix again, and here's why.  I have a boy who is not a veggie and fruit fan.  He will however eat pie and he likes Pumpkin Pie which is awesome because it can be chock-a-block full of Vitamin A, with a good dose of E and C and Calcium thrown in.

"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces.

I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides.

"This is a fairly high quality confection.  The flavor is smooth, round, and fruity, almost raisin-y.  However, I am a dark chocolate lover, and dark chocolate lovers won't be seduced by refinement alone.<br /><br />So I consulted my spouse, a light/milk chocolate lover, and we both agree that while tasty, Newman's Own Organics dark lacks that subtle, almost spicy bitterness that brings out the complexity and assertive flavors of chocolate at varying cacao levels.  Now obviously 54% cacao isn't going to register on the palate like 70%, 75% or 90% cacao, but there can still be that ""snap"" to chocolate, which is often compared to notes in coffee or chili pepper, even at the lower percentages.  I can still, for example, perceive that note in many grocery store brand chocolate morsels, although the overall quality of those will not match the Newman's.  By comparison, the Newman's has a waxiness that reminds me of Dove or Cadbury's.<br /><br />I will say that this is probably a safe choice for company, where a little something sweet is desired that won't be too much for less-than-diehard fans of the dark stuff.  It's agreeable; just not distinctive enough to kill for, which is pretty severe criticism where chocolate is concerned!",Too restrained for dark chocolate lovers,3

"Like most women, I'm always on the lookout for that next really great beauty product, whether it be a cosmetic, a perfume, or a hair product. One of the basics for me is having healthy, pretty hair. When I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, I was intrigued. The name implies something very basic and healthy without too many chemicals.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it had not been packaged well. Where the conditioner (which was sent in a separate package) had the dispenser taped down and the entire bottle wrapped in plastic, the shampoo was merely wrapped in plastic. Without the tape holding the dispenser closed, the shampoo leaked all in the plastic during shipping. On a good note, the plastic wrapping proved good enough to contain the leakage so that it didn't even touch the cardboard box.<br /><br />When I removed the plastic, I was immediately stunned at the pungent perfume smell of the leaked shampoo. I had expected something light and `clear' and not this heavy perfume stench. Once I finished washing the bottle off, the scent stayed on my hands for hours afterwards, lasting through several thorough hand washings. For someone like me who prefers most products to be unscented, this was a huge turnoff.<br /><br />Although the shampoo has a heavy perfume scent, it isn't quite as bad when used in the hair as it had been when it was leaked out of the bottle. It is still a stronger scent than I like, but not as bad as I feared.<br /><br />The shampoo washes fine but I have to say that it doesn't do any better than the Pantene Shampoo that I have used for some time. It also doesn't seem to make any difference in my hair's volume than my Pantene offers.<br /><br />Once this bottle is finished, I will return to Pantene. I prefer it's lighter, fresh scent and am very satisfied with how it cleans my hair.","'Clean' shampoo has a pungent perfume scent, works OK as a shampoo",3

"First off, let me describe my situation and usage of this product.  I'm usually stuck at work all day with nothing to eat except trail mix and nuts.  You can imagine that this gets old after awhile, so I was quite eager to try out these oat clusters (or granola, as the rest of the world calls it) to get some variety into my lunch diets.<br /><br />I'll just say right off the bat that I didn't pay much attention to how ""healthy"" this supposedly is because I'm primarily interested in taste, but it is indeed pretty healthy for this sort of snack.  I bet you're all wondering what this actually tastes like?  Well, for being a granola snack, it's decent.  I do wish that the cinnamon flavor was slightly stronger, and I kind of wish it was a bit sweeter.  Also, the flax flavor really comes out and it causes a sort of unpleasant aftertaste.  Overall, though, it's decent and I found it edible.  I do wish there were more clusters and less crumbly powder mess though.<br /><br />I should mention that the price is a bit on the high side.  For something that is essentially nothing but granola (and thus nothing new) you could probably buy granola much cheaper elsewhere.

"I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.  The dogs have to lick and roll the ball to get the flavor or treat.  DJ finally caught on though it took several licks to get the flavor flowing.  Biscuit still hasn't gotten the hang of licking to roll the ball.  Instead of licking the ball he tries to chew it.  He would get very frustrated when he would get a taste of the gravy, but couldn't lick hard enough to turn the ball.  He finally gave up on it & asked for another kind of treat.  DJ loves it but thought only 20 or so licks wasn't enough & also asked for something more substantial.  I guess it would be good as a treat when training a dog to do tricks or potty train.  It would be a nice reinforcement.  I also like giving the dogs a treat to keep them busy for a while, but this treat takes up my time, as I have to hold it.  I will stick to buying biscuits or other type treats.",Dogs are undecided!,3

"The packets make an easy and quick way to make a spicy and sweet ginger tea. However, I prefer using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029JDDE"">Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy (5.25oz)</a> to make my tea. Every packet has 17g of sugar, yet doesn't taste as sweet as Ting Ting Jahe in my opinion, which has only 3g per piece of candy. I also think that Ting Ting Jahe has a cleaner ginger flavor, but isnt as spicy as this product. This product also takes up more space and isnt as good a value as ting ting jahe. If you are looking for the quickest way to make a drink, these packets are the way to go. However, if you are willing to stir around the ginger candies until they dissolve, the ting ting jahe candies make a much better tasting drink, with less sugar and a cleaner finish. Plus, you can eat them as regular candies if you wish!","Spicy and satisfying, but not the best",3

"The flavor of these bars is very, very good.  They are filling and have many good nutritive qualities.<br /><br />That being said, we have to stop buying these bars.

It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.<br /><br />""Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity.

"I recently ordered some of Meiji's limited-edition chocolate bars online and it occurred to me that perhaps Amazon carried them for less (they don't, at all). My quest led me to this product which not only looked interesting but had garnered reviewer raves as well. Today's errands took me past a Japanese grocery, so I made it a point to have a look for it (it's apparently a popular impulse purchase because it was displayed next to the cash register).<br />Given the positive reviews, I had high hopes. And if appearance is high on your list of priorities, then this is definitely your kind of snack because one thing the Japanese have nailed, in spades, is a visual aesthetic and these things are adorable, plus mine came packaged in a really snappy cardboard tube. However, while good looks are the top priority when it comes to boyfriends, my criteria for food are much less shallow and Apollo falls short of the mark.<br />I think the basis of the problem is that the Japanese, who produce a number of slammin' items (remember that aesthetic), have so far proved themselves incapable of mastering chocolate. I have yet to sample Japanese chocolate that isn't both waxy and short on the essence of chocolate flavor. This item is no exception, plus I don't find the strawberry flavor all that vivid (although to Meiji's credit, it's natural). And it really is easy to finish the container, but I believe that's due more to the fact that Apollo is sweet and innocuous, not that it's delicious. Perhaps if cocoa butter rather than vegetable oil had been the second ingredient listed, Apollo would suggest chocolate rather than paraffin, but who can say for sure? What is sure is that I won't be buying it again.<br />The bottom line: empty calories can be had more deliciously; save your quota for a more worthy goodie. I have no doubt that this review will earn me slams from fan boys (in addition to those guaranteed to turn up immediately, courtesy of obsessive liver-lipped Finnish ugly-boy troll stalkers), but I have to call 'em as I see 'em. 3.5 stars would be about right, but we can't assign by halves so 3 it is.",Put  Wicks in Them,3

But there is a good reason, this has 27 grams of sugar vs. the 5 grams in the same size muscle milk.  This amounts to more empty carbs and hardly any healthy fats.  So even though the protein content is nice with 20 grams, the relatively high calories, lack of healthy fat, and overuse of sugar make me only give this a 3 out of 5 for overall health and usefulness in accomplishing your goals.  I also take a soy based shake which has about 15 grams of sugar and 20 grams of protein that tastes nearly as good, so for me I am going to stick with muscle milk and my soy shakes for now despite the slightly better flavor.","Tastes Great, But Too Much Sugar",3

"I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down.  This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.  Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options.<br /><br />TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same.","Not bad, not great either.",3

"Ambrosoli Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are simple little candies with added vitamins. They are drops that need to be dissolved in the mouth, releasing sweet caramel flavor and vitamins as they slowly dissipate.<br /><br />Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel have a pleasant flavor that is very much like a piece of caramel flavored hard candy. In essence, that is exactly what they are: Candy, but with added vitamins. They are sweet and pleasant to eat, with a sugary sweetness that most will find pleasant enough to recommend. And they have added B6, B12, and C vitamins for good health and other benefits.<br /><br />I have nothing against placing additional vitamins in my body and Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are certainly better than the average candy for that reason alone. Supposedly, they offer an energy benefit as well, but I cannot see how one of these small drops should be expected to add energy. Looking at the ingredients, sugar is about the only significant energy- enhancing ingredient, but even the sugar content isn't that much and it isn't nearly enough to boost one's overall energy level. I felt no different after taking one of these than I did before.<br /><br />Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are relatively inexpensive and they do offer more than standard candy, so I suppose they have their usefulness.

And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.",Some Diamond Pet Food Wellness are RECALLED,3

"While on a wheat-free trial diet for a month, I needed wheat pasta substitutes, and one kind of pasta I tried was this one from De Boles.<br /><br />This is my favorite shape of pasta.  This variety cooks up pretty fast, 5-7 minutes and it's great.  Because of the starch in the rice, it will boil over fast if you don't watch it!  You also need to rinse it with cold water after draining.  When this is done, it does not stick or clump up together.  It also doesn't turn hard or gummy.<br /><br />It does taste different than standard wheat pasta.  It has a brown rice flavor, and while it's not my favorite flavor in the world, it's tolerable.  I don't plan to buy this now that I'm back on wheat, but if you cannot have wheat or gluten, then it's a decent pasta.<br /><br />We had this brown rice pasta for mac -n cheese and for tuna noodle casserole.  In both you could taste the noodles' brown rice flavor, but the other flavors overpowered enough to compensate and the pasta didn't ruin the meal.<br /><br />Kids may find it disgusting, depending on how picky they are.<br /><br />I did not try this pasta with cold pasta salad, but it may not be half bad.",Good if you need gluten-free,3
"I grew tired of paying almost $8 lb for the German Rock Sugar at Teavana, so I started looking online for better pricing. This product came up, seemed like a great deal - but it isn't German Rock Sugar. If you like the flavor of the real stuff, this might not be for you. Yes, it's brown and it's sweet, but not quite the same flavor in your tea. I don't mind trying new things so this bag will last a few months for me, but I will go back to the real thing when it comes to reordering.<br /><br />I will say, the package arrived quickly, it was packed well, and overall, the sugar is good.",Good flavor - but not quite as good as German Rock Sugar from Teavana,3
"The product description for this water emphasizes that it has a pH of 9.5 (compared to around 7.4 for normal water) and that this somehow cures every disease known to man and drastically improves your health. First of all, I'm always suspicious of a food or beverage company making over-the-top claims about the health benefits of its product without rigorous scientific evidence. Unfortunately, too many people are gullible these days and will buy anything that promises better health.<br /><br />I don't have the medical expertise to really evaluate these claims. What I do know is that the water does taste a bit more alkaline than regular spring water. The company is at least right in that regard - you can taste the difference. Unfortunately, I'm personally not crazy about the taste - it doesn't taste as fresh. I'd recommend tasting it first and seeing whether you like the taste, rather than investing this for its supposed medicinal value.",taste a bit alkaline,3

"this is the second time I have ordered these from the same seller (Amazon as it gives free shipping). The first time the slim jims were moist and plump and oily and you could tell they were fresh. This second batch was hard and dried out and not oily at all.

I have to use 3 tea bags per 10-11oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes! I recommend Lifeboat Tea (also from UK) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors.<br /><br />If you don't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication, then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking... good for a tea party... to eat little cakes & scones with it. Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat...

"As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M.

"I wanted something like Reese's peanut butter cups, but this has neither enough chocolatey flavor nor peanut buttery.  It needs to be both saltier and sweeter.  It's just like a sort of bland peanut butter w/some unsugared cocoa powder thrown in.  The cocoa powder makes it drier and less oiler, which definite decreases the mouth-feel pleasure for me.  Seems like diet peanut butter w/choco added to make people feel less deprived.  I won't throw it out, but I went back and got Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter instead. I know it's like oranges and tangerines - not exactly the same, but I still think Justin's has a better concept for the heft and creaminess needed as well as a better level of salt.

"I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Fresh fruit falls in the middle of the pack. I really enjoy the flavor, but that flavor only lasts for about four minutes. (That's still twice the time of the two mint flavors.) According to the package, it has a mix of lemon, orange, banana, and pineapple flavors. I can't distinguish any of those - it tastes a lot like Juicyfruit flavor to me.<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth three stars despite the short-lived flavor.","Tastes good, but loses flavor fast",3
"This is a purely subjective review.  I love the Natures Path products and have been buying their oatmeal for years.  However, I would have to say this particular flavor is unimpressive.  It does not have the nice thick consistency of some of the other flavors, there are very few blueberries in it, and the cinnamon is weak.  I'd recommend the Flax Seed or Apples and Cinnamon flavors.",Natures Path I love...this one not so much,3

"It does taste pretty coffee-like. Not like the freshly brewed kind of coffee, but like the instant type. I really like the nice foam that forms on top when you add hot water (see photo). It's so easy to prepare: the instructions say to just scoop a well rounded teaspoon into a mug, add hot water and sweetener if you want and you're good to go. I actually prefer two well rounded teaspoons, but that's just a matter of taste. It smells good, it tastes good, and it's not too thin and watery like a tea. It does not taste like a perfect cup of freshly brewed coffee made with freshly ground beans, but it is a nice alternative if you can't have caffeine.",Reminds me of a mild instant coffee,3

"I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.

Looking at the order of ingredients (which is by pre-production ingredient weight), I am concerned that too much of Healthy Weight's protein may come from whole grains, which do not contain all of the amino acids that a dog must get from his or her food (dogs cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from plants and grains the way humans can.) De-boned chicken is the first ingredient, but, because it contains 75% water before processing, it is not the heaviest final ingredient.  Chicken meal is a high quality protein, but it is listed as the fifth ingredient.<br /><br />Also: At the bottom of this review I name a brand of food that ultimately helped me meet my dog's goals.<br /><br />Overview of Weight Control: While I did not do all I could to make Weight Control work for my dog, it ultimately did not help my dog reach his ideal weight. Blue Weight Control is nutrient rich, very low in fat, and uses high-quality protein sources. Unfortunately, Blue Weight Control has 444 calories per cup, which  is pretty calorie-dense.  I believe it was over 4 calories per gram, which, in human food, is the caloric density of cheddar cheese.  My dog may have been able to eat a satisfying quantity of this food if he only needed to maintain a healthy weight, but he needed to lose weight, and the portions I had to feed him were too small. Fortunately, Blue Buffalo makes an excellent food called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4"">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, and the adult food has a more reasonable 354 calories per cup, allowing my dog to eat a more satisfying quantity of food per day.<br /><br />Details: My dog weighed 50 lbs. and needed to get to the maximum ideal weight for his breed --44 lbs.-- as determined by my vet and the American Kennel Club.  According to several dog nutritionists, the calories a dog should consume per day to lose weight is computed as follows:  1)Convert his goal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2.  For my dog 44 lbs over 2.2= 20.  2  Multiply her weight in KG by 30.  For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog's case, that meant 670 calories per day.  This number represents the dog's caloric needs while on a weight loss diet, assuming the dog has no special needs, such as pregnant or whelping, being a puppy, being a toy breed, working, or living outdoors in cold weather. The formula only is valid if the dog weighs between 5 and 99 pounds. Check with your vet to make sure the daily calories you compute are in the right neighborhood.<br /><br />The reason Blue Weight Control was not the best Blue Buffalo food for my dog was because it is is relatively calorie dense-- 444 calories per cup. To feed him 670 total calories per day, I could only feed him 1.5 cups per day, meaning that each of his two meals could only be 3/4 cups, and that was without even a tiny buffer for a single green bean as a treat. (Later I explain why I had to add-in other foods.  I ended up only feeding him 2/3 of a cup for each meal, and that really worried me about the adequacy of his nutrition. This quantity of food is well below the feeding guidelines on the bag. My dog was miserable and begged constantly. He would even lick his empty bowl between meals.  I tried feeding him a 1/3 cup (10 calories) of plain no-added-salt canned green beans as a snack, just to help fill his stomach, but he was not content and eventually turned his nose up at the green bean snacks.  I should have added warm water to his dog food and stirred in the green beans, but I wasn't smart enough to do so at the time. My dog kept acting hungry and begging for more dog food.  He would actually walk over to the bag of dog food, put his paw on it, and look at me while whining softly! Other members of my household would sneak table food to him because he begged so persistently, and the ""diet"" was a abysmal failure.  My poor dog ended up actually gaining 4 more pounds from all the human cheating!<br /><br />I was glad I found Blue Longevity adult food.  It has 354 calories per cup as opposed to 444. It has 3.384 calories/gram.  I gave my dog 1.8 cups per day (in 2 meals) for 640 calories. A saleswomen at Petsmart explained that I could help increase my dog's feeling of fullness even more by adding warm water to to his food, enough to just cover the kibble, and letting it sit on the counter a minute so that the kibble would swell up. I should then stir in 10 calories (a little less than 1/4 cup) of no-added-salt green beans to make it an even more filling meal. I did all of these changes together, so I can't separate the effects. My dog stopped the whining and began to lose the weight.<br /><br />I budgeted him only 10 calories per day for treats. The problem was, I had to find something to give as a treat at least 3 times per day.  See, my dog lived in a no-kill shelter for 18 month, so I had to use treats to re-housebreak him. Now he refuses to do #2 unless he is guaranteed a treat (if he doesn't get one immediately after he goes, he lies down on the ground and makes us carry him home--even if we are two blocks from the house and it is dark and pooring down rain. Welcome to my world of loving an Australian Cattle Dog.) I was surprised to learn that small sized Milk Bones have 20 calories each and contributed to him getting overweight to begin with. Even breaking one in half wasn't enough to make his treat calories reasonable. I found a bite-sized treat that is only 1-2 calories called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VHZ84A"">Premier Liver Biscoti Dog Treats, Original Recipe, Original Bite Size, 8oz. Bag</a>).  They were fine as a substitute for Milk Bones. I recently found a 2-calorie  treat that my dog is crazy about called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVSPIC"">Zuke's Mini Naturals Salmon Dog Treats</a> (not to be confused with the 10-calorie each <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055TM554"">Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken N Cherryz, 16 oz</a>. My dog would probably walk through fire for the Salmon flavored ones, but he also likes the peanut butter flavored ones.<br /><br />Update: I eventually found a web site called DogFoodAdvisor.com.  Through it, I found another food called  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ML7S0"">Premium Edge Healthy Weight I Weight Reduction Formula Adult Dry Dog Food, 35-Pound</a> that has the same calories per cup as Longevity but that has twice as much protein (also from high quality sources!) It is also grain-free (dogs don't need grains in their diet at all) and a little less expensive per pound.  It helped my dog build muscle and lose weight.","Low fat, but not Blue's lowest calorie formula",3

"Now I have to give this product a 3, because yes it works, but there were some complications. I did not notice a difference right away like some mothers.

I was able to pump about 2 oz after each feeding prior  to taking the fenugreek, then it increased to about 6 oz after each feeding (i was storing for returning to work) About the time I started getting a result, my son was getting the side effects of horrible tummy pains. It made him constipated to where he didn't have a bm for 7 days, and he stayed up for almost 20 hrs straight screaming at one point. (he was about 2 months old and a very happy baby normally.) For this reason I had to discontinue use. I would recomend it for mothers who are having issues with their milk supply, because this is not the case for all babies, and the product works, but i would recomend discontinuing use at the first sign of a gassy fussy baby because it takes several days to get baby comfortable again once it starts- I got NO sleep for 4 days in a row.... yuck.",No sleep for me :(,3

"I was happy to see ""single-serve"" dried cherries.  When they arrived, not so happy to notice they had added sugar.  Surely cherries have enough natural sugar that adding more is unnecessary?

"INITIAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I like the idea of creating a drink that is true to the fruit's taste.  If you ate a fresh fruit, you would have an idea of what IZZE drinks would taste like.  This is a good thing, of course.  But in order to appreciate the drink, you will have to re-orient your taste if you've been drinking the over-sweetened fruit drinks.<br /><br />In a market saturated with energy drinks full of caffeine and artificial sweeteners, the company chose to go the other way to create a naturally sweet drink with no refined sugars, no caffeine and no preservatives.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT:<br /><br />For 2008 the company, which is now under PepsiCo, introduces the IZZE Fortified which contains 10% of the USRDA Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin.  And this is what is being reviewed.<br /><br />I don't know if this the fortification will make a dent towards a healthier drink compared with other fortified drinks in the market.  I guess if you couple this with the fact that it contains 70% fruit juice and is low in sodium then people who are looking for something else other than water will perhaps have a reason to want to drink this than go the soda route.<br /><br />The remaining 30% is seltzer water which can be a good alternative and a great way for adults and children to slowly steer away from the usual carbonated drinks.  Although with Pepsi at the marketing wheel, it is interesting to see how they position this product with the rest of their soda line up.  (They did say they will leave the product alone, but this is a relatively young acquisition so let's not think for a moment that the product has settled in already when it's actually just beginning.)<br /><br />TASTE:<br /><br />They have geared the drink toward a more natural taste.  So if you are used to sweetened juices, be wary and try a single sample of each flavors than a whole bulk at once.  Because the pomegranate taste you may come to know may not actually be the same taste you expect with this product.  This company is not shy in making you taste the tartness or sourness when present in a fruit.<br /><br />To compare my taste buds with others, I made my colleagues try the ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" and I got adverse reactions on the flavor.  The thing is these are people who are soda drinkers.  So they may not be the correct target market for this kinds of healthy-tasting drinks.  But then again the manufacturers need to lure these people as well if they want to expand their market.<br /><br />That's why it's interesting to see how PepsiCo will market this product in full force and convince the general soda drinkers to appreciate the taste.<br /><br />Although for a product that tries to stick to the natural fruit taste, it would be perplexing to me when the first ingredient found in a drink called ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" would be ""pure juice made from Apple""...which goes on to list in this order ""White Grape. Clarified Pineapple, Lemon, Cranberry and Pomegranate.""  Finally, Pomegranate is mentioned albeit at the end!<br /><br />SIZE:<br /><br />8.4 FL OZ is too little these days.  Although consuming this liquid in sparkling form will help you drink more slowly than if it were in the usual flat juice experience.<br /><br />I guess it's perfect for children since they are starting to sell this in schools as well.  But what about adults who have been trained to take on big drinks.  The size may be perfect if used alongside their meal, but what about in between meals?  I guess it's about time we are redirected in our thinking that if we are thirsty, then we drink water.  Unlike other products that advertises in quenching your thirst, this is not where it's heading.<br /><br />SO WHERE IS THIS PRODUCT HEADING?<br /><br />I can only surmise with the acquired taste and small size of this product, it will remain a niche product in a campaign toward healthier consumption.  In fact part of the image is being involved in a charity program that centers on needy children around the world.<br /><br />I would love to have them exist for a good cause, but I honestly won't go out and buy a product and force myself to like the taste so I can help educate the children.  If I wanted to do that then I'll simply find a non-profit organization that prides itself in maximizing contributions toward going to children than towards the running cost.<br /><br />In any case, I am not faulting the product for anything.  It's a product that certainly appeals to me and hopefully others who want a healthier option and know that water is their main source in quenching their daily thirst, but want something exciting in between.<br /><br />So three (3) starts because it's not a revolutionary product at this day and age, but at least it's something to consider.",Original owners had a great cause and purpose.,3

I thought the taste of this shake was exceptional, but as others have pointed out, it's quite high in sugar, and at only 20 grams of protein as opposed to other brands with 40 or 50, there are many products out there that would be more beneficial and provide a higher protein content.",A Catch-22 product,3

"I bought this product and it arrived in a crushed case as Amazon does not re-box the shipment. I like reduced packaging, but in this case, the product suffers as a result, and several (10+) of the packages were open and perhaps not safe for use.  The other issue is the packages are more than a few months old at the time of shipment.  Several months ago Kellogs started adding fiber to certain cereals, including Special K, and these do not have any fiber- they are probably working off old stock. In spite of all this, I would purchase again- these are great for portion control, which is difficult for cereal, and these would be perfect for food service, day cares, day camps, churches and other groups. I plan on throwing some in my suitcase for travel- most processed prepackaged foods are approved for entry into other countries and these will be good on the go. Hopefully in the near future Amazon will get newer stock with the added fiber.  Make no mistake, Special K is not something most people would consider healthy- high fructose corn syrup is one of the main ingredients and with the lack of fiber, this is little better than a kids cereal, but I do like it for a treat when I am craving something sweet.

The big box, which I normally hate to do, was odorless. I scooped out the poop. I scooped out the clumps of urine, including all the small break away clumps and was done. No more rumaging around getting out the odds and ends that had gotten wet and needed to be gotten rid of to get rid of odor. Done in 5 minutes flat.<br />On to the little box. Took the disposable plastic spoon and got out the clumps of poop. Got out the few urine clumps and was done. Two minutes flat.<br />Got the hand held battery driven sweeper and got the dust that hit the floor and was done. It took me  10 minutes to do a job that used to take 30 minutes.<br />And the best part was that it was just a job. It was not a gross out production. I washed my hands with disinfectant soap and came to write the review.<br />Best Kitty Litter Stuff I have ever used. I put it on for monthly delivery and am pleased with the whole deal, cost and all. It arrives at my front door once a month with no extra shopping and cleans up like a breeze. No smell. I certianly recommend it to all kitter people.<br /><br />After using this for almost 6 weeks, I have to amend my first review of this product. Yes, it is amazing and keeps the smell down, but it was not as great as I thought. Initially, I had used it for my two kittens. Their poops are small and they urinate and leave small little domes and both were well covered. Then, I began using this Pure Product (not mixed with any other product with all four of my cats, two of whom are regular cats, one is 16 pounds and one is 11. One is female and one is male. Now males are nice things, but when it comes to male cats, urinating IS a BIG deal. My cat seems to save it up for a one or two times a day process, so when he goes, it is a flood. And Male urine is more pungent than female cat urine. There is too much of it to make the usual nice compact valcano shaped product that the kittens leave. He simly wets down one whole end of the box and it smells to bad to mix with the other and is also too saturated to do so, so one twentieth of the entire box has to be thrown out after Mr. T. uses the box. That automatically means the box cannot be used by him more than 20 times. Then, in comes the female. She does leave a compact volcano shaped urine package, but the poop is huge and has to go. If nobody bothered to cover anything, I could scoop out the poop and lift out the urine and be done. Worked with the kittens. But no, with the addition of two humongo cats, the box is throughly stired and within 4 or 5 days, at the MOST, the whole 7 pounds is used up and gone. I cannot afford 7 pounds of the litter 6 or 7 times a month.<br /><br />Also, with the addition of the two big cats, litter bits were everywhere and walking on that litter is like walking on sand in your house. It tears up the tile and gets in the carpet. Ugh. I spent a lot of time cleaning the laundry room where the boxes are when I used this litter.<br /><br />So overall, I have moved this from a 5 star to a 3 star item. I can't afford it, with bigs cats added, it does smell, and I cannot afford enough to cover 4 cats for the month. So, I have moved it down to three stars. Sorry about that, but REALITY HIT ME!",THIS IS WONDERFUL AMAZING STUFF/WELL MAYBE,3

"This was a very odd product; a definite re-imagining of the traditional Fig Newton.  I was excited to read ""real fruit"" on the front cover, but after consuming a thin, was rather disappointed that the bits of fig were rather sparse.  Additionally, those words make you wonder as to what kind of ""fig"" the traditional Fig Newton uses...<br /><br />The cookie portion is tasty, albeit a bit dry.  It's a cross between shortbread and graham cracker and a digestive biscuit, leaning more towards the latter.  There was so little ""fig"" per cookie, that I was primarily eating a cookie.  At least the cookie portion was delicious.  And the little bits of fig that I did have ended up getting stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />In conclusion; I'd call it a cookie with bits of fig.

"**Former Child Star Thumper Meets Tragic End**<br /><br />The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.<br /><br />Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward ""Eddie"" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.<br /><br />""Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?""  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. ""If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!"" and ""Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?""<br /><br />Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed ""Thumper"" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!"" formed the basis of what is now known as ""The Thumperian Principle"" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, ""Suck My Carrot"", ""Young Bunny Coed Love"", and finally, ""The Bunny Hole"".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the ""Shake A Leg Foundation"" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.",Thumper Rabbit RIP,3

"For some reason, I thought these contain some berries (my dog loves picking blackberries off the bushes in the late summer).  They don't. Just plain old cheap, small training treats.

I'm sure they're not as great nutritionally as some other treats, but comes with quite a bit for $4.  My dog likes them, but he's not very picky either.  They're smaller than a centimeter in diameter, and would not be good for a kong because they'd fall out wayyyy too quickly.

The character of the poduct is a smoky flavor with a little spice, but being one who likes hot foods, it didn't have enough to get my engine running.  I think it is a decent product, but at least the shipment I got was extremely dry.  I know it is jerky, so it's like it is supposed to be dry, but other brands I have had like World Kitches seem to retain a little more of the natural oils and juices.

"I've been looking over some alternatives to dairy drinks to go with my meals. Plus, I might add the meals of my little boy (3.5 years). So, I was looking around in a nearby Trader Joe's  and found this interesting Pacific Natural Foods Organic Almond non-dairy beverage. It has a good, if somewhat bland, flavor and goes down easily very much like a low-fat milk. The calories per serving are moderate but the fat is a little high. I should add that the fat is non-saturated and non-trans and there is no cholesterol. The 50-50 sodium to potassium ratio is about ideal. I think the drink is a little low in protein that I should substitute it for milk in my boy's diet. All in all, I'm favorably impressed and this was my first experience with an almond beverage.

"Another reviewer said these looked like ""hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes"", and aside from the color, I'd have to agree.  Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say ""Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight.""  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />""Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food.""<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.

Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience.""<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet.","Large and awkward size for cats, might be better for dogs",3

I tried drinking reGen when I was doing a run (treadmill) and I found it easy enough to run and drink at the same time (punctured the top with a straw - not included).  Actually, reGen should consider adding a straw to the box, since the top has the ""foil square"" that you can rip off - this makes it easier for those who are on the go!

All in all, it's a pretty good drink while working out, but considering the cost, I probably will stick to my Gatorade.",Glorified Chocolate Milk,3
"This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.",not correc size,3

"First impression: meh. I sampled a few more, and the flavor kind of grew on me. You can taste all the ingredients you're supposed to notice--oats, cranberries, a little hint of citrus. Then I tried it with my coffee, and it was GOOD.<br /><br />I think that's the key--other reviewers have noted that tea or coffee goes great with this snack. It's not something you can mindlessly shove into your mouth while watching reality shows, not that I ever do that, but if you need a little treat in the afternoon, it's tasty with a cup of joe.<br /><br />The cranberries made this chewy, which was a nice combination (like pinwheel cookies). Putting two textures together can be tricky, and if not done correctly, is a real turn-off for me. But here the crunchy/chewy textures enhance each other.<br /><br />My family tasted these, as well. One of my kids liked the cookie but thought the calorie count a little high for a serving of three (140 calories).

"So far, I have not been real happy with this Stevia.  I have been using NuNaturals NuStevia powder for a couple of years, but thought I would try a liquid.  So far, I find that I have to use a LOT more of this liquid than expected.  I find that if I use 2 packets of powder, I have to use 1 tsp of this liquid, and it doesn't really sweeten as well.  Not only that, but I can definitely taste something other than sweetness.  I am wondering if it is the grapefruit seed extract that is used for a preservative.  I find this to be much more bitter than the powder, and I haven't really figured out the dosage I need to use yet, though I have been trying to get it right.  I didn't have so much trouble with the powder, so I am disappointed.<br /><br />I purchased three bottles, so when I have used this up, I am going to try another brand, I just don't know which one will give me the sweetness with the recommended dose.  There is no way that 1 tsp equals 1 cup of sugar, as stated in several conversion charts!  I seem to have to add some Agave syrup to counteract the bitterness and non-sweetness of this product, and I am trying to get away from doing this.<br /><br />One thing I have discovered is that items made with this liquid stevia seem to get sweeter after setting for a while.

Recently I saw the Donut House flavor offered at my local warehouse club and it piqued my interest, problem is that the warehouse box contains 80 K-cups, didn't want to buy 80 of something I may not like. So, I picked up an 18-count box at my local Walmart, I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Starbucks coffee's, I think they are too strong, too bold, too bitter. I like a flavorful, medium roast but full-bodied cup of coffee. The Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups fit this bill, whenever I would make a cup at my office, everyone would comment, ""Wow, that smells so good!"", it tasted just as good.<br /><br />I tried the Donut House coffee this morning, no inviting aroma when brewing, very bland in taste, I don't know how they get away with calling this ""Bold"". It says right on the box, ""light roast"", I don't know how a ""light roast"" can be called ""Bold""? I was expecting a very full-bodied flavor, but without a bitter after-taste. Well, there was no after-taste, no taste period, just very bland!<br /><br />FYI, I usually use 16 oz. ""to go"" cups when brewing K-cups, I use 2 K-cups per 16 oz. cup, I brew the first K-cup on the middle button (8 oz. setting), the the second K-cup on the lowest setting (I think it is 6.5 oz. setting), this allows room for a teaspoon of sugar and some half and half to a golden color. I have been doing this for years with my Columbian K-cups and always get a great cup of coffee, did the same with the Donut House blend, drinkable, but not remarkable in any way.

It doesn't say use within x number of days on the package, so all you have to go by is the expiration date. the expiration date i believe is for products that haven't been opened yet. so now that it's been opened how long will it last? so my suggestion is buy it only if you plan on using it often.<br /><br />as far as the actual product goes, it doesn't dissolve well in cold liquid like iced tea.

"This product is made in Canada. The ingredients listed on the label are: ""Sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk, reduced minerals whey (milk), lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin, an artificial flavor.""<br /><br />The label also states: ""Made with over 50 hazelnuts per jar. Contains no artificial colors. Contains no artificial preservatives. Do not refrigerate or microwave.""<br /><br />It contains the same calories as peanut butter, 100 calories per tablespoon. It has 5.5 g. fat, 11 g carbs, and 1.5 g protein per tablespoon.<br /><br />Though this product tastes good, it is not a health food, and it is quite expensive. A 13 oz. jar sells for around $4.00 in a supermarket.<br /><br />In addition, if you are interested in buying sustainable products, palm oil is associated with the slashing and burning of pristine rainforest.

"Kashi's products are usually pretty good. However, when it comes to snack bars, these are mediocre at best.<br /><br />The good -- the bars aren't cloyingly sweet. They do taste like natural banana, but have a slight bitterness (some other reviewers have commented on a 'burnt' flavor).<br /><br />The bad -- the nutritional value isn't notable, and these aren't exactly 'health' bars. The chocolate chips, rumored by the packaging to be contained therein, are unidentifiable and not taste-able in the product. The texture is unremarkable, a bit too dry.<br /><br />In all, I wouldn't purchase these again.

"Kind Healthy Grains never calls itself a cereal, which is probably a good thing. While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.  They come with most of the nutrition benefits but neither of the drawbacks that I outlined above.  We'll be sticking with them instead.",More of a Tasty Topping vs. a Breakfast Option,3

Even though I don't care for this blend of coffee, I'm glad I purchased it to get a manufacturer-provided example of the type of grind and proper amount of coffee to use in the EkoBrew cup.)<br /><br />This Honduras House Blend coffee is a medium-light roast coffee at best.  Weaker than anything you'd get at a restaurant or coffee shop, that's for sure.  It's not acidy or bitter at all, just not full-bodied or bold flavored.  I tend to use a heavy hand with my cream, and for this coffee only needed about half as much.  As a reference, I drink Newman's Own K-cups on a daily basis and find them to be a near-perfect cup of coffee.  I do prefer darker roasts like Green Mountain's Sumatra Reserve or Dark Magic.<br /><br />This isn't a *bad* roast, just a weak one.

"I know ""Sweet Potato and Chicken"" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are also allergic to chicken.

"I was always a big fan Of Gloria Jeans Raspberry chocolate beans as they made a wonderful cup of coffee and the house smelled so good just from having the beans around.  When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.

Some may want to add sweetener to it in an effort to balance the flavor. I personally found the coffee tastes much better over ice with added sweetener.

My baby doesn't have any difficulty digesting it.  So the cereal itself is fine.  The bad part of this product is the packaging.  When I received the Amazon box containing 10 of these, the cereal flakes were already all over the box even though it wasn't apparent that any cereal box exploded. It was a pain cleaning it up.  Then I opened the clear wrap on one individual cereal box.  Again, the cereal flakes were all over the place.  It was a pain cleaning it up.

"I like that that this nutrition bar uses lots of organic ingredients, that it also has protein, fiber, is low in sugar and is also gluten free. The bars were kind of sticky which is probably because of the Brown Rice Syrup and the Tapioca Syrup to hold it all together.  It had lots of peanuts, with a few raisins, so it was definitely way more salty than sweet.<br /><br />Overall, I think this bar was just ok, and it was much too salty for me.

"This is my first bonsai.  I will try to update this review periodically with more information.<br /><br />The plant arrived in good condition and well watered.  Mine does not look  like the picture.  It is definitely a lot more sparse and less ""natural"" looking.  I'm hoping that some pruning will fix that over time.  It also lost a few leaves on the first day, but seems to have really come alive after being watered and given sunlight.  I'm sure 3 days in a box can't be too healthy for it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, there are two holes at the bottom of the pot, so you'll need to figure out a way to deal with the water which leaks out.<br /><br />Update 9/23/2008:  I would bump this review up to 4 stars, but Amazon won't let me.  The plant still hasn't filled out much more and still does not look as good as the picture, but it has remained remarkably healthy with very little effort.  I've kept it at my desk at work where it receives little if any sunlight.  Watering it twice a week and occasionally moving it near a window for a weekend has kept it very healthy and green.  I've received lots of positive comments from co-workers.","Looks good, not great",3

"I absolutely LOVE Orville Redenbacher Kettle Korn.  It hasn't been available locally for over a month, with no idea when it will be in stock again.  I tried making my own, but it was awful.  Finally, I find that Amazon will actually ship this (it's hit and miss for us overseas military folks).  So, I ordered 3 of these (that's a total of 90 bags).  I figured this would be more than enough to tide over my craving until it's available again locally.<br /><br />Well, I got two different batches and they are both awful.  Kettle Korn is buttery, slightly salty and slightly sweet.  A great 3-way combo.  Well, this stuff I got is just sweet and way, way TOO sweet.  They are bad batches.  I eat enough of this stuff to be able to tell the difference between a good and bad batch.  The two batches I got were the WORST batches I've ever had.<br /><br />I don't know if Amazon got these for a low price because they are ""off"" or what, but I will definitely not be buying any more.  As for the huge stock I have now, I have to add my own butter and salt to make it even slightly edible.  If I liked sweet, instead of salty, snacks, these would fit the bill.

"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one.

"A friend recommended a wine aerator, so I ordered the Vinturi set from Amazon for my husband who is the wine connoisseur in our household. The aerator is great, but the stand is a waste of money. If you try to pour the wine through the aerator using the stand, the wine pours directly down and makes a mess. The directions say to hold the aerator at an angle, which is what you have to do to make the aerator work properly. I don't understand why the stand/holder aims the aerator straight down rather at an angle as instructed. I highly recommend the aerator but not in the set. It is better and less expensive to order the aerator separately and forget the stand because the stand simply cannot be used without making a complete mess on the countertop. As for the aerated wine, my husband says that a mediocre bottle wine tastes like a much more expensive wine when aerated with the Vinturi, and that was the objective, so the aerator is great, but the stand is worthless.",Great concept,3
"From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.",I don't recommend this treat for your dog.,3

"These beans are heavenly and we love them, so we thought we would start a subscription for them to be delivered to us.

Unless I find a way to get the other three cans to replace these I will be canceling the subscription and not buying this brand any more.<br /><br />It is too expensive in our local health food store, and we thought this would be a great idea.

"First off I'm going to say I don't know what they mean by Congo, especially since its mini in this case.  I'm assuming that's just the general shape of the treat.  Regardless, my dog had a good time with it.<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I was surprised to see these mini-congo's were not so mini at all.  This is a fairly large treat and I wouldn't recommend using it for training purposes.  This is one of those treats you should give instead of a bone or maybe once a week.  Which is what I've been doing.  My dog's a great bone chewer, actually its probably her only talent aside from making trouble and she can inhale one in no time flat.  When I saw this, I thought for sure that it would be gone in a good 30 seconds but surprisingly it took her longer.  The outer part of the treat is rather hard like a bone so she had to chew her way through it.  I'd say it probably took her a half hour to finish the entire treat and she does get excited when she sees the package now so I'm assuming she likes the taste (peanut butter) as well.<br /><br />The next thing to comment on would be that this is all about digestive support.  I don't want to get into too much detail but it seemed like instead of helping my dog's digestive system, it made it a little harder for her to do her business.  Each time after she's had one she's had a little trouble with her normal activities the next day.  Perhaps since she is already on a high protein diet, this is the cause of that since this is a high protein treat.  I'm not too thrilled with the ingredients in this treat either.  The ingredients include: Beefhide, Riceflour, maltodextrins, dextrose, caramel color, papain, and artificial peanut butter flavor.  Really, artificial?  Peanut butter's not that expensive and it would have been much better to give real than fake.  At least the beefhide and riceflour were real I suppose.<br /><br />As a whole I'd rate this an average dog treat.  You can't use it for training purposes due to its size and the nature of the treat means its not good on a daily basis.  Add in the artifical peanut butter and it does round to somewhere in the middle.  But hey, at least my dog liked it and it kept her busy long enough for me to cook supper.  So that's something.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011",FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support,3

"Since this is promoted as a healthy product, it receives 1 less star for the use of a very thin plastic. Thinner than what you find in regular soda/pop bottles.

"It is wonderful being able to use your own teas and coffees at much less expense.  But that advantage comes with a disadvantage also, which for me is worth putting up with until something better comes along, though at times  is very frustrating.  The disadvantage is that liquid comes through not only the opening designed for it, but also all over the place making quite a mess.  I've tried all kinds of ways to try to stop this, but it is a necessary evil and you need to wipe down the coffee maker (and surrounding counter)after each use.  The lids fit snuggly on the k-cups, but, it appears the spout that goes into the hole does not fit as snugly as it does when it punctures a real k-cup, thus causing water to go over the sides...and/or it backs up through the hole (due to spacing) and runs over the edge.

"I saw Eight O'Clock coffee, whole-bean unground, 11 ounce bag for $4 at the local grocery store chain, aka HEB(it's a big one, here in Texas).  I was blown away!  I recognized the name as something of a throwback from decades past, probably my grandmother would remember this coffee brand, and at this price, it was worth a gamble.  I bought four of them.<br /><br />My motto is, how bad can you screw up the coffee, if you can grind the whole beans yourself, and the beans haven't been sitting there for a couple of years?  Even the cheapest coffee, if roasted minimally and ground fresh by me, tastes better then the most expensive coffee, that is pre-ground, sitting on a shelf for a few months.  There is no comparison, fresh ground always crushes, pun not intended, pre-ground.<br /><br />So back to this Eight O'Clock whole-bean coffee I got on sale.  I use my electric grinder, which is the typical handheld electric grinder, and I top it off with the Eight O'Clock beans, which is the normal amount, grind it, and throw it in my french coffee press, add the nearly boiling water, press it, and pour myself a cup.  Oh yea, I add heavy whipping cream, instead of half and half, because I'm watching my carbs.<br /><br />What can I say? Coffee is great.  It's different from the Starbucks burnt flavor, cause I have Starbucks wholebean as well.  Eight O'Clock has a hint of sweetness, I'm pretty sure that several local restaurants must use Tata for coffee, because it has a similar flavor.  It's obvious that it's not as heavily roasted as Starbucks, but what is?<br /><br />Anyway, after reading the negative reviews here, I'm not sure if there's a quality control issue, a bad batch, or if there is some counterfeit coffee being sold ....whatever the problem is, I know I won't be buying this Eight O'Clock coffee online.  I trust my local grocer if  run into a bad batch to take it back.<br /><br />I'm going back tonight to buy out the rest of their Eight O'Clock.",hmmm.  bizarre,3

Understand, the paper wrapper around the bag was fine, it's the bags themselves that are NOT sealed.  I can literally pour the tea out on the counter once removed from the paper wrapper.  The box was completely useless.<br /><br />As I said before, I really like this tea ... I just hope Lipton gets their act together regarding their tea bags.",Great Tea ... Bags Suck!,3

So it's far sweeter than I was expecting.  I decided to try and figure out how much sugar was in there, and it comes out to about 7.5% of the entire thing is sugar.

At double strength, the taste approached a good cup of Folgers, but the aftertaste remained - slightly bitter and pervasive. I am sure there is a chemical explanation for that, but I don't have it... :)<br /><br />In conclusion, not a ""horrible"" tasting coffee... just on the southern side of ordinary - with a cloying aftertaste that kills the deal.

"These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.","A healthy alternative, but with overpowering and inconsistent flavor",3

He said the size of the 1.5 liter bottle was good in that it was plenty to drink but bad because it wouldn't fit into any of his car's cup holders.

"If I had to sum up what I though of ""GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers,"" I would probably say that it is an adult form of the popular ""lunchables"" that were easy-to-make lunches for kids to take to school with them.  This is about the same size as those kid's lunches, which means that it's probably not going to fill an adult up and is therefore not really to be considered a meal.  It's a pretty in-depth snack to take on a hike or even to just eat at home if you need to nibble; and it contains 22g protein, 11g fiber, and 410 calories.  However, it's not the tastiest food in the world, and I'm not sure that I actually liked it all that much.<br /><br />The box has a tab that will pull in order to open the box, and inside you will find the following: a plastic fork, a plastic container of salmon spread, a package containing six crackers, a mini bag of a fruit/nut trail mix, a mini bad of dry roasted soy beans (edamame), and a square of chocolate.  I personally didn't even use the fork since I found it better to use a knife to spread the salmon with.  As for the salmon's taste...it was fishy with a hint of citrus.  I appreciate good salmon, but this was not good, in my opinion.  The crackers were delicious, though (how can you ruin those?).  I didn't like the roasted soy beans either; they were like burnt sunflower seeds with a peanut texture.  As for the fruit/nut trail mix, it contained very few banana chips, cranberries, and peanuts.  They were all covered with a layer of sugar, which, of course, made them delicious.  The chocolate was divine, as well, but the square was very, very small.  Another thing to note is that on the inside of the box, there are some interesting facts and a sudoku puzzle.<br /><br />Overall, I would just have to say that I personally like the layout of this product but not so much the ingredients.  I would love to try another type such as the steak nuggets or turkey pepperoni, but I will not be buying this one again.

They just really, really aren't my thing.<br /><br />The main flavor seems to be the Breakfast Tea flavor.  Yeah, they took Earl Grey Green and flavored it with black tea extract.  I have no idea why.  Black tea is a dime a dozen if you're into that kind of thing, and I'm not.  I think my mother would adore this tea:  she eschews most flavored tea and sticks to your basic blacks, though she does like Earl Grey.<br /><br />I will continue my hunt for an excellent decaf earl grey green.  I suspect this one is for black tea lovers who want the health benefits of a green tea.<br /><br />*lest you think I'm a shill, I didn't care for the majority of his teas, but the earl grey green!

"I guess I have a high heat tolerance, because this only seemed maybe two or three times as hot as a grocery store habanero. (according to scoville rating, the weaker grocery store habaneros are about ten times less than this, the red savina which I have never tried is supposed to be three times hotter)<br />That isn't why I'm giving this only three stars though.<br /><br />First off the taste - it was terrible. I haven't tried the peppers themselves yet, but the powder tastes awful I've tried it with soup and chips, and it worked slightly better with chips - and made my soup taste bad. It's a bit hard to describe - bitter and dry I guess would be the best way to describe it. Not sweet like I expected... I have heard ghost peppers have a somewhat similar sweet taste to the habanero. In this powder though I don't taste that at all.<br /><br />Second this stuff is very... dust like.<br />you have to be very careful pouring it, because it is ground so fine that it gets into the air easier than anything I've ever seen. Fortunately when I breathe it in, it doesn't really burn - I guess it's just to small and insignificant of an amount to do that, but it does make me cough a lot.<br /><br />I'll update the review a bit more once I try out the peppers themselves, even though they are a bonus.<br /><br />Edit: I got around to trying the peppers themselves, and the taste was similar. Perhaps I just don't like the taste of these peppers. I definitely would not call them sweet tasting at all though.",Somewhat hot.,3

They are small, so they make for a great light snack.  The shortbread is perfect to me; it isn't overly sweet or overly buttery.  The only thing I wish Knott's would change, would be the amount of the fruit center.  I know the cookie is small, but I think if the fruit center were larger, it would balance out the cookie nicer.  Plus, without each cookie being individually wrapped, the shortbread crumbles & sticks right to the fruit center, so it covers up the taste even more.  To me that would make it perfect, but as is I'd still highly recommend these to anyone.",Another great product from Knott's BF,4

"From the way my two dogs inhaled these Newman's Own Organics Lam and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats, I would say that they are a hit with my canines.<br /><br />They were crunchy enough that the dogs at least had to chew them instead of swallowing them whole.  The smell wasn't bad like most dog treats and while my husky didn't stop to smell the roses, or rather, the treats, my chow mix did.  A couple of sniffs and then the treat disappeared.<br /><br />If I could change anything with the treats, I would love for them to come in a single bite instead of two biscuits together.  The treats were hard and not that easy to break.  I think they would have lasted longer had them come in a single 'square' instead of a two part rectangle.<br /><br />I would buy these for my dogs again!<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine",I wish my dogs could talk!,4

"Edit:  Added a second part.<br />===============================================<br />Original Post<br />I use this with the whirleypop, which I'm expecting to break any minute, but that aside, this makes near perfect popcorn.  The coconut taste is a little bit stronger than what you'd find in movie theatres but overall a bit bland (which is not a bad thing).  I frankly prefer that than trading the health benefits for overly processed oil.  That and while I love coconut trading the near tasteless flavor of the oil for a strong coconut flavor would reduce it's versatility in cooking.<br /><br />So when you salt this lightly with popcorn it stands on its own.  But I season mine with kernel's seasons, splenda, sugar, some salty butter flavoring along with melted Nutiva, mixed then drizzled on top.  In short, it's one step short of heaven and the switch from Canola is immediate and amazing.  I honestly can't stop eating it and it is rather healthy in comparison to movie theatre popcorn as I use far less and still has a very similar oil fragrance and taste.  Yes I still treat it like an oil and use about 2.5 to 3 tablespoons for a 1/3 cup of unpopped corn.<br /><br />On that note, while I applaud the brave reviewers out there who put this on their hair, and eat it religiously daily this is still an oil.  Perhaps a high quality one and one I may put on my split ends one day, but to me this is a yummy cooking oil you use in moderation.<br /><br />It also is a tad expensive (hence subbing a star) and again I do find it too bland to use alone on toasted bread (perhaps it has to be toasted together in the toaster oven) but the quality and convenience is really good.<br /><br />So if you happen to use it in other ways, good on you but I am happy with using it sparingly, and simply for popcorn.  It seems much more useful to me than using it as the latest and greatest in health fads today.  Especially because oil, even when healthy, contributes a hefty amount of calories and fat to your diet.<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Note about the Coconut Oil Hype<br /><br />Seems like a few people are very into the hype, so much so that if you do not write an overly glorifying review of coconut oil something is wrong with you.  I'm not a believer in ONLY scientific studies and if that were the case I would not care for reviews by buyers from amazon.  And frankly I love you reviwers as you save me time and money.  However I do have a limit on what I hear from the internet.  And whenever there is the word ""miracle"" attached to something in the title I use a heavy amount of skepticism.  And MANY people believe coconut and coconut oil is a ""miracle"".<br /><br />Sorry folks it isn't.  I do realize all the benefits of coconut water by the way. Coconut water is extremely healthy and even used as in emergencies to substitute for human blood, but even so I would hesitate to call coconut water a ""miracle"" as drinking it alone is not a cure for aids, cancer, etc. as suggested by some. That, to me would constitute a true miracle. And if it were true, coconuts would have been discovered a long time ago as a cure for aids/cancer, etc.<br /><br />Coconut water is undoubtedly good FOR you and I love coconuts as a whole but do use some discretion when eating OIL.<br /><br />To me, if you're thin, eating fat is not so much an issue when the fat is healthier and you probably need some caloric substance. Extra virgin coconut oil, while still being researched, comes from a coconut and thusly is inherently healthy to some degree. However, if you're already overweight, then eating 3 tablespoons of oil, ANY oil, on TOP of what you eat amounts to 390+ calories extra which means you gain a pound in only 10 days.  It is VERY easy to overeat oil and that said I would really hesitate to overuse coconut oil or any oil without extensive studies.<br /><br />So those reading what I wrote, as of March 3rd, 2011 coconut oil is still being heavily studied.  Just google it if the following links do not show.<br />[...]If you're on the fence, don't consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies ARE done.  If it's oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  Don't buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you're already overweight.","Near Perfect for popcorn, experimental for other things",4

"I came across the Fizz Pops here by accident and ordered them immediately.  I hadn't had them since I was a kid and wanted to see if they were similar to those I remembered.  My grandparents used to bring one for me and one for my sister every time they visited.  I also recall them being in glass jars on the counters of small stores as we drove ""up north"" to visit grandma and grandpa.  I don't know what brand they were, but they were almost identical to these Paskesz Fizz Pops.  The best way I can describe them is that they are like compressed confectioner's sugar with a very light fruit flavor.  Kind of like the texture of a sweet-tart, but without the tart.  If you suck on them like a regular lollipop, it will hurt your tongue and the roof of your mouth.  They don't dissolve in the same way that hard candy does.  Instead, you kind of chip away at them with your teeth and chew the little pieces that come off.  Now, if I didn't have this good childhood memory, I admit there's a chance that trying them as an adult for the first time, I might not be that excited about them.  But, it was fun to find them again.  Everyone in our family liked them.  And, I found one friend who remembered having these as a child, too and said ""Oh, I missed those lollipops that hurt your mouth if you sucked on them too hard!""  So, if you don't compare them to a regular lollipop and judge them on their own, you might find you like them, too.",Sweet Childhood Memories,4

"Our dog loved the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q7YFLQ"">Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, 4-Ounce Package</a>, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is working on training their dog. The ingredients are healthy, and apparently it is quite tasty.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, because the treats are a little larger than I would like. Of course, you can just break them in pieces to make great rewards. They crumble a bit, but those crumbs still work! Our dog still hasn't got all of the commands down, but at least she looked forward to the training.",A Favorite Treat,4

"When I was a child, I loved chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but when I stopped eating them for a few years and tasted them again, I found them not to be tempting at all.  They had a strange chemical taste that wasn't appealing.  These cookies, while they definitely have a hint of an artificial flavor of some kind, are significantly better, and I recommend them for someone who needs chocolate in a hurry.  The cookie itself is fine - soft enough to be chewy, hard enough that most of the cookies don't fall apart - but the real draw of this new cookie is the chocolate goo in the center.  I tasted five or six cookies in a row, and each one was consistent, with a truly indulgent pool of fudge encased in a delicate crunchy layer, like the candy shell on an M&M.  The contrasting textures in each bite of cookie (chewy cookie, crisp border, then luxurious goo) make for an entertaining snack that pleases the senses.  If the cookie itself had tasted a little more like a homemade cookie, then I would have awarded this product five stars, but what I tasted was definitely worth recommending to any chocolate lover who likes a texturally entertaining sweet.","Not Homemade, but Intriguing",4

"I remember being a Brit transplanted in a small, conservative, wasp town in Massachusetts.  The first time I went to school with a cheese and pickle sandwich I was inundated with disdainful remarks.  However, I am 20 years older now, and still truly enjoy the special taste.  I have taught my first Americans to enjoy it too.  So my youngsters now take the same lunch.  Fantastic after all these years.",cheese and pickle please,4

The soda was very refreshing.  It did not have the overpowering sweetness of other sodas.  The carbonation helped to give it a nice little kick. The only gripe I may have was the it had more of a fruit punch sort of flavor.  The cherry flavor was not very pronounced.,Nice refreshing light taste,4

"To me, this is good but nowhere near as good as the pineapple flavor.  I think the mango just does not compliment the peach, BUT, it's still good and appears to be healthy and has a reasonable amount of calories.  It was between a 3 and 4 for me so I rounded up to 4.<br /><br />It's light and refreshing, like water with mango, peach, and coconut flavor added. It doesn't taste phony either. It is 100% natural and it tastes natural. Too good to be just flavored water. It tastes more like a light fruit juice.  I had mine chilled. It is imported from Brazil. A plastic twist-off cap allows you to stick in a straw easily, without hammering the package to punch it through. A single package is about 6 inches high, with 3 inch diagonal square shape.<br /><br />One paper coated package contains 17 fluid ounces, marked as 2 servings. Per serving stats are 60 calories (so 120 calories total per package), 0 fat, 0 cholesterol, 30mg sodium, 500 mg potassium, 15g sugar, 4 % calcium, 4 % phosphorus, 175 % vitamin C, 8 % magnesium. Ingredients, as listed in order on package are: natural coconut water, mango puree, peach puree, ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The package states it is 100 % natural, has more electrolytes than leading sports drinks with 15 times the potassium, and has more potassium than 2 bananas.<br /><br />So--- it is good, refreshing, healthy, easily packable, and easily openable. (It's ok. I can make up words. I work for the government.) I really like the high potassium content, too. (Note--I am NOT a doctor.) As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out. Anyway, this is good and it sure tastes a lot better to me than Gatoraid (yuk). So, check it out, and read up on ""potassium"" before the heat gets here.",More like fruit juice than water,4

The larger 1.5 liter bottle is convenient for bringing to the gym to keep hydrated during a workout or for a long day at work. I can't say I could tell if the 9.5 pH or electrolytes made a difference or not, but I did like the taste better than the average bottle of water. I had to take a star off because although it's a good water, the price is a little on the high side for me.","Clean tasting water, convenient bottle size",4

"When we were in London three years ago, I loved the tea I was served at a hotel breakfast.  I asked the waitress what brand it was so that I could buy some and take it back home.  She returned from the kitchen and said, ""It's just PG Tips.""  I didn't have a chance to buy any before coming home, but did buy it from Amazon upon our return.  Shortly after starting to drink it daily, my husband and I became very jittery.  We mentioned it to our doctor who is British and she said, ""You can't drink that! It's too strong for Americans.""  We continue to buy it from Amazon, in bulk, but now we use one teabag per teapot (3 to 4 cups) instead of one per cup, to cut down on caffeine.  It's still good.  And recently we purchased the decaf bags to have in the evening.",Joyeuse,4

"yes, that's right, our family has 10 cats (all rescues), so you can imagine I was pretty stoked when this product came up for review.<br /><br />Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month. About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of ""juice"", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.<br />In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.<br />3.5 stars.",my 10 cat review.....,4

"The tea bags are smaller than I'm used to getting from Bigelow, so the tea itself is weaker with the same steep time.  Sugar and cream are absolutely required however, as it is only boardline palletable straight.  If you are expecting something along the lines of hot chocolate in tea form, you will be dissappointed.  There is a hint of chocolate in here, but its overpowered by the ""hazelnut"" which itself isn't exactly like any other hazelnut flavor I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it is actually an enjoyable tea, but no one I've given it to as a blind taste test have been able to guess ""chocolate hazelnut"" as the flavor.  Several got that there was chocolate in it, but that was the closest anyone could guess.<br /><br />Very good as a late night relaxation hot tea, I honestly could not picture drinking this cold (and do not intend to try).  Once I'm finished with the box though, I do not intend to buy more.  It was an interesting novelty tea, but it isn't something I would drink on a regular basis.<br /><br />On a side note, I bought this tea at a Target for far less than the listed price plus shipping here on Amazon.  Indeed try it for yourself, but don't buy from here.","Somewhat weak, but pretty good.",4

I don't have much to choose from in the stores here and came to the decision that the only way to get good coffee is to order it online. I was surprised to see that there weren't many outstanding choices in that space either but this company fits the bill. I could order this directly from the merchant but decided to get it from Amazon because I get free shipping with my Prime membership. The coffee arrived on time and I have been enjoying it ever since. I am buying for just one person so I broke the five-pound-bag into eight smaller bags and put them in the freezer. This works out great. I ordered the Columbian Supremeo. It's an excellent value and I am looking forward to trying out another variety.,Great Coffee - Excellent Value,4

"I want to call these cookies, but they aren't, quite. Nabisco calls them ""Thins"". Okay, they are very thin, so I guess that is the most appropriate term.<br /><br />My thins arrived from Amazon in rather poor shape. At least half of the cookies were smashed beyond belief. I rescued a half dozen large pieces to try and threw out the rest.<br /><br />I can almost tell you exactly what they tasted like if you ever ate Fig Newtons. I found it very interesting that the crispy cookie parts tasted just like the cake part of a Fig Newton, with crispness gone wild. They are very crisp!!<br /><br />Apparently embedded in the newtony stuff is the fruit parts. They looked like dried fruit. Mine was cranberry citrus. Frankly, I didn't expect much, but I was really wowed. The thins, cookies, whatever, ended up being very tasty.<br /><br />Would I recommend this product? Depends. I would personally not buy them again. I would myself buy the old fashioned Fig Newtons. I just really liked them.

Other than it feeling oily and smelling good when I use it, it pretty much does exactly the same thing my usual brand does.<br /><br />Now, I have yet to see it in stores but I would assume it will be more expensive than my usual brand so its unlikely I will pick this up when I need more.<br /><br />If for some reason after I go back to my old brand I realize something or I miss something about this I will come back and update, but those are my feelings as of now.",Smells and works well.,4

I've only tried two flavors, the Black Cherry, and the Kiwi Berry; they are pretty similar but I slightly prefer the Black Cherry.  The fruit names are silly anyway as they use a blend of several fruits.<br /><br />The carbonation is very light and the mixed fruit concentrate they use has a very pleasant flavor.  There is no added sugar or fake sweeteners which seem to be in so many prepared beverages these days.  Because it is juice only and a slight amount of carbonation, there is no after taste.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find these drinks to be too sweet at all, and I fully expected to considering all juice usually tastes pretty darn sweet to me.  I think the carbonation may tone down the sweetness of the juice?<br /><br />I like the 8.3oz amount; it is just the right amount. For me this is a ""special"" once-in-awhile treat so I don't mind the price.",Refreshing and just the right amount,4

"Vine is such a great innovation to get one to try or discover things they otherwise would most likely never become acquainted with.<br /><br />This is very good coffee, but the fact that it is one of the packet varieties leaves the necessity to have one of the brewers designed for such in order to obtain the correct results. I found a really inexpensive Mr. Coffee here for under $20 that I can ""always"" use to keep on hand in my seldom used cupboard above my fridge so it is available but out of the way. In lieu of this solution, I would suggest perhaps a french press setup that one could really squeeze the packet in order to get the full benefit of the ingredient....which, by the way, is an excellent Ethiopian yirgacheffe, totally organic (yeah), and of medium strength....just right (for me at least) on those yellow-sunshiny-mornings that seem to be quite frequent here in my area of the country of late. Back deck, wonderful spring sunshine, a croissant and a cup of this yummy brew is perfect for starting a beautiful April Day!<br /><br />Many have complained here about the strength, etc., but they are not processing the packets properly, thus I would recommend discounting most of those reviews. This really is great coffee....you are hearing this from a lifelong coffee-hound who appreciates almost all blends and harvests of beans from the world over.

"Before I order anything online, I try to research as much as possible.  There were so many comments complaining about the packaging, stating that the litter was spilling out of the box when it arrived.  I was under the assumption that the Arm & Hammer box was shipped alone.  And that may be the case if shipped from another supplier, but I have a monthly subscription from Amazon. The 40lb litter box is placed in a different Amazon box before it ships.  Some of my litter spilled out too, but I just simply poured the 2 tablespoons back into the original box.  The subscription saves money and makes things so convenient, since it's delivered right to the door each month.  Then the shipping is free on top of all that.  Lifting 40lbs is no prob for me, but my girlfriend sure does appreciate the free delivery.<br />  Pertaining to the effectiveness of the litter......  I am a dog person, so being around cats is new to me.  I made my girlfriend try at least 10-12 different types of litter, and found that none of them work perfectly.  Arm & Hammer works for us since it meets most requirements better than others.  (masks odor better than any other I've tried, clumps well, inexpensive)  Then the subscription makes it so convenient.

"Delicious medium roast coffee made of 100% Arabica beans, grown in Ethiopia by a very conscious company.  This company exists in an area where child labor is prevalent; they however, insist the children of laborers go to school.

However, both my wife and myself find this to be a premium coffee that has a slightly different taste than that which we are familiar. I am not saying that in a negative way, just to let you know that it will be something a bit different.

"When it comes to snacking, the crunch dried snacks are the best. Each fruit has a distinctive texture and flavor. The individual pieces are flavorful so you can nibble one tiny piece of banana and actually taste banana. There is no fat so you don't have greasy fingers.  You can take the packages anywhere.  Dried blueberries taste like blueberries.  Dried cherries taste like cherries. In some of the dried fruit mixes, the general taste is ""blend."" With Sensible Foods crunch dried snacks, you can savor the morsels slowly, one individual flavor and one individual texture at a time or eat them fast, mingling textures and tastes depending.<br /><br />I keep packages on hand to satisfy midnight snack urges,  to crunch instead of chips when I eat a sandwich, to snack while I watch the tube or to grab and go.

However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.

"VERY Good product. Its tasty and its also relatively low cal (check out the nutritional data). Its something served all the time in the UK that most Americans have never heard of. Most of my American friends kind of turn their noses up at the idea of it till I actually have them try it, and then they like it a lot and want to know where they can buy it. This stuff really is very tasty, think of it as being sort of like hot vichyssois only not quite.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY Amazon ships these not bound together in any sort of a secure way, they just put them in a box thats too big, with a few of those air pillow things. The weight of the cans is such that the first time they squash the pillows, the pillows pop, meaning 8 heavy cans are now in a box that is way to big for them flying around and slamming into each other. By the time the product arrives it looks like someone was using it to play kick the can, and the air pillows are now all flat.<br /><br />Food in dented cans does not have the same life expectancy (think days rather than months depending on how bad the dent is), and in fact its important that you eat it right away because botulism can develop and that stuff will kill you.<br /><br />Considering this is not a cheap item, as in seriously not cheap, its really disheartening that Amazon persists in not doing a better job of packing it before shipping. I've ordered it from them 3 times now and each time, the condition of the product is the same.

"I like all the varieties of Stagg Chili I have tried. They are always delicious, and there are varieties for every type of chili lover out there. ""Turkey Ranchero"" is a good alternative for those trying to cut fat from their diet. It's 98% fat free because the turkey is very lean. The flavor profile is pleasing, with nice paprika notes, but I could have used more jalapeno and generally stronger pepper flavors. The extremely lean and thick nature of this particular chili is also responsible for a drawback. The chili is advertised as ""thick and hearty"" and it is definitely part of a satisfying meal, however the combination of extremely thick viscosity combined with the ultra-lean turkey makes for some predictable problems for cooking, namely, the tendency is for this to stick badly to the pan, especially if overheated (I recommend medium heat at the most.) It is of crucial importance to stir this chili almost continuously when cooking or your pan will have a challenging to clean black charred residue on the bottom of it. Greasing the pan is an option, but can defeat the purposes of using lean meat in the first place if not careful. Do not get impatient: cooking this product slightly slower pays big dividends in the taste and cleanup departments.<br /><br />I really like Staggs' ""Turkey Ranchero"" and recommend it without hesitation; it has an enormous amount of beans, a very generous amount of turkey, and pleasant (though relatively mild) seasonings that most people will like (though I like to add red pepper flakes to mine.) A serving (two per can) has 19 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber, which for the hearty flavors makes the 5 grams of fat seem a reasonable tradeoff for most diets. Like any processed foods (and especially canned soups) the sodium levels are high at 790 mg per serving, so people on a restricted sodium diet should stay away.",A Mild-Mannered Bean-Intensive Lean Turkey Chili,4

Always in the market for a cheaper k-cup (and living in San Francisco) I was happy to have stumbled upon the  San Francisco Bay brand. I was worried about the weird shape at first but it still works in the brewer. I like that the packaging is trimmed down so I don't feel as guilty about the environental impact of overpackaging  (told you I live in SF!)  The French Roast is very bold and at first I was unsure...I think I like  it just fine but plan to try another roast next time. It also tastes a bit more acidic than other brands but that isn't such a bad thing either. I think I am getting used to it.

"The shampoo does a great job and the scent is not too strong - although it does linger. You can smell it hours later if you rub your fingers through your hair.

So, as a shampoo - great. The other benefits? Nope.","Works great, nice scent - label is a little misleading",4

"I like these t-discs for their convenience but like others here, I would rate these a step below the flavor you get with the tea-bags. I gave the English Breakfast a 5-star rating because I think the disc makers got it right with that mix. To be fair, the Bergamont flavor that makes Earl Grey so appealing has to be hard to reproduce in a quick-drink type machine. Twinings does it well enough. I would still purchase these discs and can taste the flavor in the tea. It's just not quite as strong as what you get when you brew the tea conventionally. I'm certain Twinings will continue to work on the mix and soon, this will likely not be a problem.",Good Earl Grey for on-the-go or a quick cup at night.,4

"Both my 1.5 and 3.5 year olds love these snacks.  They are a bit on the sweet side but no more so than most packaged kid snacks, and the ingredients in this item are pretty straightforward (i.e. not a lot of weird chemicals or fillers), so that makes me feel a bit better.  I also don't give them out all the time.  I tend to use them when I need a snack when we're going out and about.  This also makes sense because they aren't cheap, so to use them all the time at home would be a waste of packaging plastic and money.  I actually discovered these when one child was having a meltdown at Target and I needed something FAST to quell the outbreak and this is what was handy.  After that discovery, I found Amazon to have the best deal in bulk.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/6/2012 - Kids still love these snacks.

"Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar come out of the box quite sweet enough for me, and that's something, considering how attached I have become to that Southern favorite, sweet iced tea.  They've also got a nice crunch to them, and I've found them tasty for breakfast, or as a snack. The soluble oatmeal is a good way to help satisfy the federal dietary guidelines suggested daily whole grain consumption.  And, of course, this cereal is a useful baby step towards keeping your heart healthy.<br /><br />The Quaker product contains 46 grams of whole grain per one cup (56 grams) serving, of which there are about eleven in the box.  This is 96% of the guidelines' suggested minimum whole grain requirement per serving.  There are 210 calories per serving, 6  grams of protein per serving, 0.5% saturated fat, 2% of the daily suggested intake of that element.  190 mg of sodium, 8% of the daily suggested.  9 g of sugars; 5 g of fiber, which is 19% of the daily suggested. There is no trans fat, only 1 g each of polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat per serving. As I look through the ingredients, I actually see nothing that I'm trying to avoid, no high-fructose corn syrup, etc.<br /><br />The federal guidelines say that diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods may help reduce the risk of heart disease.  This product offers 3 g of soluble fiber a serving, a handy keystone to a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Diet experts recommend eating at least three one-ounce servings of whole grains, or 48 grams, daily, based on a 2,000 calorie daily diet.  So here you have 46 grams of whole grains per serving.  Handy, right?<br /><br />So it tastes good, and it's good for you, a winning combo.  A good food to try.","Tastes Good, and Good for You",4
"I tested this coffee using a regular Mr. Coffee brewer and a standard coffee filter.  Although the product is designed for those one-cup brewers, I don't have one so I used what I had.  It comes in the sealed pods that are designed to drop right in the the brewer without and mess.  I had to open the pouch to brew it in the Mr. Coffee but still found it made a lot less mess just pouring it from an opening in the pouch.  The first time I just made one cup; the second time I brewed two cups using two pouches.<br /><br />I found the coffee quite good, especially the aroma.  (I really loved the aroma!)  It definitely has floral and berry notes that do not overwhelm the coffee flavor. I like that it is organic and Fair Trade Certified.  This product also claims that ""We use beans only from coffee farms that adhere to strict sustainability ethics.""  You really can't get a much purer source than this.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee gourmand so I shared this brew with a friend who is very particular about her coffee to see her reaction.  I will drink just about any coffee but she likes her coffee strong.  She found this coffee strong and thought that it came awfully close to the coffee she gets from that Seattle chain.  She found the floral and berry ""aftertaste"" pleasant and not bitter.  She said for her it's definitely 4-star. (Remember, this is a gal who knows her coffee.)",Amost as good as that place in Seattle.............,4
"Oh goodness this is so delicious if you like these flavors and love kool-aid! I can't believe there are no calories in this and I love the fact it can fit into my purse to take with me when I need a little sweetness in my spring water. I am not one who likes water so this is a great alternative to buying sugar-laden, or nasty sugar-free energy drinks. The flavor is strong or weak depending on how much you use in your water. I like it fairly sweet so 2 semi-long squirts is just right. It's kinda addicting since it reminds me of drinking kool-aid! The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is the price, I can not believe what they charge for this considering it is not an energy, vitamin enhancer, or health increasing kind of drink. Just some yummy flavor to perk up your water now and then : )",Like having concentrated kool-aid in a bottle!,4
"In a normal day we will drink two pots of Folgers in the morning and two in the afternoon followed by at least one during and after dinner.  Would you say we have a drinking problem?  Actually it is not a problem but more a habit of consuming a quality taste.  When available those cups are filled with Gourmet Supreme.  Sometimes it just is not available.  Amazon has filled most of the empty holes for our coffee addition, however.  Maybe it is just us but the coffee we have received from Amazon appears to be of a fresher nature and not stale as we have received from other grocers.<br /><br />Even though we sincerely enjoy drinking this brand, we fault the producer for several matters.  There are too many instances of ground stems in the contents.  A rep from Folgers assured me that there were no stems in the coffee; however, coffee beans usually are dark brown and not in the shape of a ground light colored stem.  Additionally, it seems as if almost all producers of most products are playing with the net weight of it packages.  It used to be (dark age era) that a 16 ounce bag of coffee was a pound and no more.  If I wanted a larger container I had a choice of buying several one pounders or a three pound bag.  Most of the bags came as beans and I had to self grind it or get the clerk to do it for me.  Not today.  The large container here is 27.8 ounces today and we have no idea what it will be tomorrow other than the price will probably increase.  Even the old pounder is now 13 ounces.  I recall potato chips coming in a pound bag but today it's 10 ounces or 11.3 or some other amount of ounces.  Each time it is with a price increase.  My needs are simple:  top quality coffee at soup kitchen prices with no fillers or constantly changing packages.  If a price increase is needed because of fluctuating international markets then increase the price.<br /><br />Regardless of my comments in the above paragraph I still find Folgers a quality brand and will continue using it.",Gourmet Taste on Soup Kitchen Budget,4

"As a guy, I don't do much baking. Although, after reading the directions on the box, I figured it'd be tough to mess this recipe up.<br /><br />I chose the mini-muffin route. For the muffin tins I was using, this box of mix yielded about 30 muffins. I also included about ¼ of a banana, finely chopped, in my batch (I always feel so short changed when I buy a banana/apple/etc. muffin and it turns out to just be fruit ""flavored"" with no actual bits of fruit in it). The estimated cooking times on the box seemed spot on. In my 400° oven (thermometer verified), the ideal time was about ten minutes per twenty-four mini's.<br /><br />I'm surprised the instructions don't recommend adding fruit as an option, because these things came out great! Not only that, but they were quite easy to make. It couldn't have taken me more than thirty-five minutes from prep to clean up.<br /><br />I'm deducting one star for the banana flavoring (dried bananas, according to the ingredients panel). I can't really blame Krusteaz for this because all commercially processed bananas/banana flavorings always seem to taste like they're way beyond ripe. I'm one of those people who likes bananas that are fresh or still a little green.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'll definitely be buying Krusteaz again.","Good taste, bachelor easy.",4

"We got the Tug-a-Jug this morning and have used it twice to dispense my dog's breakfast and dinner. She never quite figured out the ""tug"" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the ""tug"" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy.

"Izze's grapefruit flavored sparkling juice is, for all practical purposes, just another formulation of liquid sugar, albeit from grape, pear, and other fruits.  Nutritionally, it really is no different from any other sugar-based drink, whether orange juice or sugar soda.  What makes it acceptable is both its taste (more below) and its controlled portion size (8.4-ounces).  That 8.4 ounces is a far cry from the normal 12, the increasingly common 20, and those other large portions that ""fool"" the consumer with the nutritional note that there are ""only"" 110 calories per serving but there are 2.5 or more portions!<br /><br />I conducted a taste test of this grapefruit flavored Izze with two teenagers, two registered nurses, one registered dietitian, and two adult athletes.  They all were impressed with the flavor, and thought the ""gentle"" carbonation added to the enjoyment.  One teen mentioned that the smaller size encouraged sipping rather than chugging.  It is much better cold than at room temperature.<br /><br />The aluminum container is recyclable (encouraged).  I've seen this particular brand and size sold at cafes for about a buck fifty a can.<br /><br />Enjoyable!

"edited- These cookies are quite good! But *only* if you microwave them. I put them in usually about 30 secs, butyou just have to do it till you can tell its softened. If you dont heat it, then you can't taste the chocolate chips at all and as a result is really unsatisfying. Although, in my opinion w a really good snack you shouldnt have to do anything to it.

"Puerh tea is one of my personal favorites but understandably a lot of casual tea drinkers are often turned off by the earthy-muddy taste that a true puerh produces.  Puerh's unique flavor comes from the process that used to create tea which involves a lengthy fermentation period.  It is this fermentation process that gives puerh additional benefits and is known in China as a 'dieter's' tea because of its diuretic properties.<br /><br />Numi Organic's Magnolia Puerh is a high quality tea utilizing only organic elements (the grean tea leaves, the puerh leaves as well as the magnolia) in this blend.  By combining green tea and magnolia Numi has created an easily drinkable puerh blend that first time and more casual drinkers can immediately latch onto.  My only caveat is that while being a delicious tea blend, the base flavor of puerh is significantly diminished (but its still there!  if you know what you're looking for) so puerh purists may not find the appeal here.  Still, this is a very tasty blend that makes puerh more accessible to just about anyone that enjoys a good cuppa.",A very palatable and easy to drink puerh,4
"Firstly, let me say that this is a great product if you are looking for a wheat free bread as I was.<br />It's moist, tasty and great for bread machines.<br /><br />The only reason I ordered this was because of the big 23% OFF sign, however what they reduced in product price, they made back in shipping.  Also, there was NO DISCOUNT for buying 6 packets.<br />Price including shipping was $36 and change.<br /><br />Bottom line is that instead of waiting several days to buy this product, just go to your local Fred Meyer where it's sold for $6 per packet! If they had not ""reduced"" the price by 23%, then you would be getting ripped off severely as you would be paying close to $10 more - you can get an entire grocery list delivered to your home from Fred Meyer for about the same!!<br />When you factor in that you also get club card rewards, you are better off buying it from Fred Meyer than direct from the manufacturer....I won't be ordering online again.<br /><br />But good product!",Great Product - Pricing is the same as Fred Meyer!,4

"Writing that this is among the best cups of coffee in the thirty-five years of consumption may be of interest to you, however this coffee is very good and tastes even better when made at a coffee shop or restaurant.  The reason is the water and equipment.  Several coffee shop owners have explained filtered water is more important than the coffee, followed by the coffee, and then the equipment (same pressure and temperature every time).  At home most of us have yet to invest in the expensive equipment to achieve this.  We use a simple single cup drip maker and it works well but the coffee at Glory Days, where we first discovered this coffee, is better and it's the same stuff.

"This product does the trick for me- provides a reasonable cherry flavor for beverages (soda in my case). On the single bottle (rather than 3-pack) variant of this product some reviewers say the flavor is not very strong. Others say it taste more like maraschino cherry. I think the issue with that is that this flavor is, in fact, extremely potent. Anything but 1-2 drops in a standard size beverage will be too much (think cough syrup).

"I've tried both Purple Acai/blueberry and Goji/Raspberry.  Both are equally nice.  This is a light flavor tea, it is not strong like some of the black/green tea.  If you are looking for a strong tea, you will not like this.  When I drink this, I feel like I am in a sunny field and surrounded by flowers.  It makes me happy and instantly put me in a good mood (it's just me, it doesn't actually have the effect in the tea).

"I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body.

This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.","High quality, organic!, a little flat",4

"The real reviewer - Indiana Jones (aka Indy Bear) a 13ish mix that came straight from the humane society.  Over the last 12 years Indy has been through cancer, hip displaysia, severe arthritis, and several tummy issues that his vet referred to as ""garbage gut"" and now he's lost his hearing.<br /><br />Did I mention that he's a pudgy dog?  Maybe its spending the first year of his life in a pound, but even now - he LOVES to eat.  So when the opportunity to try a new snack came along, he informed me that it was my only choice.<br /><br />I do like that these are organic... not that my dog cares. But I still would prefer if the first ingredient was a meat or meat based product.  My dog has canine teeth made for gripping, tearing, and scissoring which means that the rest of his body is set up for the consumption of MEAT.  Not corn, potatoes, barley etc.  Now granted the ingredients in here are far better than a milkbone, but you pay for them as well.<br /><br />These come in a nice little rectangle shape that is scored down the middle (like a short fat graham cracker) I didn't bother breaking it at the score because he would know and not leave me alone until the other half appeared.  Needless to say - they are VERY hard, but apparently quite tasty.  I don't know that a little dog, or a baby puppy could eat them but since Indy is a 60lbs Australian Shepherd/Springer Spaniel mix (with a smattering of other doggies in there too) he had no trouble eating them.  Much like all food it disappeared quickly with little to no facial expression so I can only assume that they must be okay.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to purchase these - I did like that they came in a bag rather than a box, but would have preferred a more ""green"" bag rather than plastic.

"The history of incorporating chocolate into breakfast cereal is a little hazy but we know with certainty Kellogg's had combined the stuff with its Rice Krispies line in the 1950s (hence Cocoa Krispies were born).  We know that in the time since, chocolate has become an absolute staple in the breakfast cereal world but, generally speaking, has been relegated to the domain of children's cereals while adults are expected to enjoy more ""sensible"" selections; often with the terms like oats, grain, fiber, or corn in the title.<br /><br />Of late it appears Kellogg's is doing its best to blur the lines between such stereotypes and entries like their Special K Chocolaty Delight and Krave (reviewed here) are prime examples of this evolution of reasoning.<br /><br />Beginning with the box itself, Krave makes clear the notion that this is adult-targeted in presentation; no flashy colors, no cartoony mascot and certainly no prizes to be found inside.  What you do gain by studying up on the cardboard is that Krave is a crispy multigrain cereal outside with smooth chocolate inside- and that it's made with real chocolate at that.<br /><br />Additionally a quick scan of the side of the box reveals that every serving is made with 9 grams of whole grains and is a ""good source"" of fiber; in this case 3g per serving.  But enough with all of the dry facts, the real deal breaker when it comes to a market with as many great choices as the cereal aisle has to offer is taste.  That said, to my perpetually juvenile taste buds, Krave tastes pretty darn good.<br /><br />The initial flavor is undeniably that of the corn outer shell but it's not as crispy or firm as say Cap'N Crunch.  Rather it's fairly airy and light and doesn't take long to absorb milk.  Fans of extremely crispy cereal may be better off looking elsewhere (or eating fast).  The chocolate is surprisingly rich and not the usual powdered affair typically associated with cereal.<br /><br />In all, the smooth chocolate and airy crispy corn combination work surprisingly well together.  It seemed to me like the corn taste actually becomes less and less prevalent as the outside of the cereal absorbs milk.  By the time the bowl is complete, I was tasting mostly the soft chocolate filling (and had no complaints with that).<br /><br />In conclusion, Krave is certainly worth the price of admission.  I typically try not to allow myself to get too attached to new cereals, as brands tend to appear and disappear so frequently with little to no warning but after a few bowls, I think it's safe to assume Krave could build itself a lasting niche in the competitive market on account of the fact that there really isn't a flavor/ consistency exactly like it out there.  I will definitely be adding it to my rotation.",Unique Flavor- Worthy of a Try,4

"These are pretty good.<br /><br />The cans are well filled with product, and not too much water.  The cans have a pull-top which is easy to open.<br /><br />The artichokes do appear to be young, smaller ones and, rather surprisingly, the gentle aromas and flavor complexities of that still comes across, even in the canned product.  They all have an even, healthy color without bruising or other blemishes.  While it's true that all canned foods are going to taste ""canned"", these are much less noticeable in that regard than any other artichokes packed in water that I've purchased.  The flavor is good, as is the texture.  They are quite tender, not mushy, but you can easily smoosh them for puree or bruschetta or what you will.<br /><br />They are quartered pieces, easy to use as-is or chop as desired.  I have had to remove what I consider to be some tough bits and outer leaves.  Maybe these weren't bad enough to bother other people.  I've had much worse from canned artichokes!<br /><br />They do not lend a canned/metallic flavor to other ingredients, nor are they too salty, oily, vinegary, bitter, stale, or any of the other unpleasant flavors that one often gets with canned artichokes.  Cooked as an addition to other dishes they contribute appealingly.","Some Tough Bits, But Tasty, Not Mushy, Fresh Taste",4

"This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it.

"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.","Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it",4

"Both cats love Halo's Liv a Littles Freeze Dried Chicken Breast. My youngest cat wanted nothing to do with these treats for a long time then one day changed her mind and now is the biggest fan in the house. I haven't tried the Beef or Salmon. Chicken is king around here.<br /><br />I reserve these for once in a while treats or to entice eating by sprinkling it atop newly introduced wet/raw foods. The Halo website says the chicken is made in a marinade broth of sodium phosphate, salt, and carrageenan before it's freeze dried. I trust Halo's practices but do wonder how much salt is used in the process and wish the amount was on the label.<br /><br />I also have a tube of Thrive Freeze Dried Chicken from a UK company that has been very popular at holistic pet retailers lately. Their claim is that it's 100% freeze dried chicken and nothing else. I can't garner any more information than that from the tube or the manufacturer website, but my cats go nuts for Thrive just like they do Halo.<br /><br />These are expensive little treats but the cool thing about them is they can be served as solid chunks or broken into dust like particles, or wet by adding a little water. I have to think that with so many cats out there who have lost teeth, this is probably a superior treat to have once in awhile.",Guard with your Life,4
"Because I barely average six hours of sleep each night, I need a lot of coffee to keep me going throughout the day.  I love iced coffee during the warm summer months.  Many of the fast food chains are providing it.  Coca-Cola is now selling coffee in the can.  The illy issimo Cappuccino, manufactured by Coca-Cola, is much sweeter than the illy issimo Caff&egrave; [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].  The Cappuccino has a lot more sugar and milk than the Caff&egrave;, which is basically black coffee.  However, the Cappuccino still pales in comparison to other leading brands.  I have posted photographs of illy issimo Cappuccino alongside its leading competitors: Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy + Coffee Drink, Mocha [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U56LE2"">Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy+Coffee Drink, Mocha, 15 oz (Pack of 12)</a>], and Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBVJI"">Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].<br /><br />  I enjoy the sweet, creamy taste of illy issimo Cappuccino straight from its can or sipping it from a glass full of ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  However, it doesn't taste as delicious as the Starbucks Doubleshot.  (See my posted photograph.)  When compared to Starbucks and Java, the liquid in the glass is still darker than the others.  (See posted photograph.)  I don't think Starbucks has to worry about losing customers to Coca-Cola.  I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy coffee drinks manufactured by Starbucks instead of illy issimo.<br /><br />  Also, I don't quite understand why the cans of illy issimo say, ""Do Not Shake.""  I posted a photograph of a glass bottle of Starbucks Frappuccino Mocha [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS"">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>]; one can see that its contents have settled at the bottom.  I always shake my bottles and cans of coffee drinks before opening them.  The contents have never spewed like carbonated soda; instead, they have appeared slightly frothy.  However, I just remembered from looking at the ingredients (which I have posted on this website) that both illy issimo Caff&egrave; and illy issimo Cappuccino have potassium bicarbonate.  Perhaps the potassium bicarbonate will cause the coffee to spew if shaken.  Why do these products contain potassium bicarbonate?  Commonly found in club soda, potassium bicarbonate softens the affects of effervescence.  It is also used as a fire suppression agent (""BC dry chemical"") in some dry chemical fire extinguishers.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Cappuccino is recommended for coffee drinkers who love sugar and cream in their coffee but think Starbucks has too much in their products.  Perhaps you are a long-term consumer of Starbucks products and you desire something different; illy issimo Cappuccino would be worth trying for a change.  I wonder if the Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, will be offering free samples of the illy issimo coffee drinks.<br /><br />Joseph B.

"It's hard to go wrong with Izze. It's just like soda, except it's made with actual fruit juice. No sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This particular blend is described as pomegranate, but it's a mix of apple, grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. Overall it's tart and refreshing, not too sweet. However, the taste of grape and cranberry rather overpowers the pomegranate. Also, with the recent focus on pomegranate as a particularly healthy juice, it would be nice if the pomegranate-to-everything-else ratio was higher, so I'm only going to give it 4 out of 5.<br /><br />As to the fortification, as with most fortified foods it's more of a selling point than something of real value. You're better off getting your vitamins from a healthy diet, or (if you must) a multivitamin tablet.<br /><br />However, I'll keep drinking Izze when I feel an urge to drink soda. It may not be the healthiest drink, but it's a lot healthier than the high fructose corn syrup and chemical flavorings sold by the two big name soda makers.",Soda you can feel good about drinking,4

I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do.

"This is our 3rd jug. My dog Loooooves it and eats his dinner out of it every night. Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!<br />UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!",Awesome product for many dogs!,4

"This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...

"I love tea.  I especially love green tea.  I also love passion fruit (they flavor everything with that these days, don't they) and I really love the soothing pallet cleansing quality of aloe vera.  So, I was particularly pleased to get to try this Chan Tea product; this green tea infusion.  I'll start by warning that this looks really unappealing upon receipt and that judging from the large amount of floating debris (pulp) and the murky green color one may be almost repulsed by the presence of this product.  That said; I had to try it, so I did and I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, this really doesn't taste anything like green tea or passion fruit, but there is a familiarity to the flavoring so maybe the subtle hints are sparking memories on my tongue.  What I will say is that the flavor is solid, with no aftertaste at all and the sweet levels are balanced to the point where this tastes fresh and authentic and organic and, well, sort of delicious.  The texture of the drink can be a little off putting, considering that there is so much pulp your constantly rolling balls off the roof of your mouth.

"Before I go any further in this review, I have to admit that I initially didn't know that this came in pods when I requested it. For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a ""pot"" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole ""organic, fair trade"" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)",Tastes pretty good!,4

"According to the box, Rendang Curry is a food served in Saigon. I now officially love love love Saigon food. One box would easily serve 4, and takes mere minutes to put together. I served it over couscous, which was a perfect accompaniment because it didn't fight the huge flavors of the sauce. The curry is a unique combination of flavors - spicy with a bit of heat but that same heat disappears quickly in your mouth as the sweetness of the coconut milk kicks in. It really was spectacular flavors that were new to me.<br /><br />A downside. The box calls for 28 ounces of beef tenderloin. Where I live, that's about $35 worth of beef. I talked with my local butcher and he suggested I use sirloin cut up for stir fry (labelled as ""stir fry beef"" in my grocery store). That cut the cost of the meat down to about $6.00. Because the meat cooks in the sauce for several minutes, the meet was very tender and I see no drawback from the substitution.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this product again. In fact, I will be looking for other Prima Taste products to try! If you like to try new international foods, definitely put this one on your list.<br /><br />(The four star review instead of 5 stars was due to the recipe calling for Beef Tenderloin.

"If you're trying to avoid sweets over the holidays, but drink coffee and like chocolate, this may be just the thing.  As promised, it is strong and satisfying--so much so that this reviewer, who drinks Starbucks regularly, will be using less that the prescribed amount in the future.

It appears that a decaf version is available, and that's the one I would keep on hand so as to avoid the fattening snacks which are a constant temptation during the holiday season.<br />$14. a pound is a lot for coffee, so I would consider this a luxury to purchase occasionally or as a gift, or to put on your wish list so you get it as a gift.  There is a ""subscribe and save"" option which brings the price down somewhat.",Chocolate and coffee are two major food groups,4

"This stuff is great, while I don't like this kind as much as the Natural Calm with Calcium, it was my own fault for not looking close enough when I ordered the second bottle for the office. I actually look forward to having this in the AM with my breakfast and in the PM before bed. You can feel the relaxation slightly, it is not overwhelming. Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.<br /><br />The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it.",Great Stuff,4
"This mackerel tastes good. It is water with salt inside. The cans state that this a product of China. It is a ""Chicken of the Sea"" product though; so I thought it is worth trying.

"I have used this in coffee, oatmeal and yogurt and it has a good chocolate flavor (considering that it is just a flavoring and doesn't actually have chocolate in it).  However, it is not quite as sweet as other stevia products; I find myself using a squirt of it instead of ""just a few drops"" as it says in the description.  I would still recommend it though because it is a lot less expensive than other stevia flavorings I have found.  I add a little cocoa powder along with it to yogurt to give it more chocolate flavor.",Good flavor and good price,4

I was eating a pint of this stuff and thought I would do a google search and see if I could find some reviews..<br />Funny how people are saying this stuff is so bad. I like it. I mean really.. what do you expect with all the bonus stuff about it (low cal/ low carb/ gluten free etc)?  Its not ice cream and maybe it does taste like a frozen protein shake but so what?<br /><br />If you were ok with eating a pint of ice cream you would get ice cream!<br />For someone like me with all kinds of food allergies/ intolerances and who watches calories and fat this is a good product for an occasional indulgence. The whole pint thing is great.<br /><br />I have only had the vanilla maple but I'm gonna say I would buy it again and enjoy it again.,I think it's good.,4

"Part of the reason I tried this is the availability via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.<br />Being able to combine serious quality feline food with the convenience of having it show up on my doorstep is something of a no-brainer for me. The fact that having it delivered means I'm visiting those pet emporiums less and therefore getting all wanty over the cats up for adoption probably is a good thing for me.<br />As for the food itself, my crew has responded rather favorably to it. We had a little extra vomiting initially as they adjusted, but I've had that happen with almost anything drastically new I tried.<br />I think this food has helped my oldest two the most. One had been getting increasingly sedentary and I suspected she was having joint pain. Now she's back to jumping up on furniture and being much more interactive with us. Her coat looks good too. She's actually at her best ever.<br />My other old girl had been having the occasional seizure this past year. These have decreased in frequency. She already had a good coat but damned if it doesn't look even more luscious. You'd never believe she's a mature cat.<br />My other two don't have issues that this food addresses, but I want my healthy ones living long and healthy lives. I wish I could say my big boy cat was a little less big, but I know that's not the purpose of this food. And I know in his case, no matter what his diet is, he's gonna stench up that litter box.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried this food for them. Very worthwhile.",Works for my cats!,4

"First, my shipment arrived without any dent or leak in any of the cans which is awesome.<br />I will begin to review all the flavors (except for cherry, I have not tried the cherry one) :<br /><br />- Grape : This one is my favorite. It tastes almost like normal grape soda but you can still taste the real fruit juice. It leaves the after taste of real grape juice. The carbonation is about the right amount.<br /><br />- Orange : My second favorite flavor. It was very yummy and taste very real. If you let a friend drink it, he/she will be able to tell it is made from real juice and not artificial flavor.<br /><br />- Lemon lime : Great combination of flavors. The tartness is just right but the flavor is just ok, nothing impressive.<br /><br />- Kiwi/berry & Watermelon/strawberry : I found these two too sweet. The kiwi/berries taste is too strong it almost reminds me of artificial flavors in candy.<br /><br />- Cherry : I did not try this flavor but my boyfriend said it is his favorite and he loves it.<br /><br />Bottom line : Get this variety pack to see what flavors you like. My bf and I both love carbonated drinks but stopped drinking regular soda a while ago due to high fructose corn syrup.  The can size is a little small but it is easy to pack with your lunch to take on the go.",Great tasting,4

He's been eating this for about 3-4 months now, has lost 4 lbs. and no longer gets the gurgling stomach.  He seems vibrant as ever.  Though I typically add a little meat, he is willing to eat this food dry on its own (something he's never done with other foods).  The only downside I have noticed is that it makes his stools VERY smelly - not sure if this is because he's sensitive to an ingredient or a result of the probiotics/supplements the food contains.",Seems great for overweight dogs,4

I have purchased other Nature's Variety products quite often in the past, but this is my first time getting the freeze dried treats.  I like that meat, fruit, and vegetables are the main ingredients and feel confident in feeding this to my dog.  The only reason I removed a star from the rating is because of the price.

"I'm by no means a a coffee expert, but I do drink a ton of it every day.  I do have sensitive tastebuds, and can tell the differences and nuances between a Starbucks Sumatra and a Dunkin Donuts dark roast.  My taste ranges mostly for medium to strong flavored coffees.  This coffee is on the medium side of the flavor spectrum, and it's free of the sourness found in some store brands.  I would call it a mild medium, and I like the portable package as a way to break up the monotony of what's offered at the office.  I can keep a pack or 2 in my desk drawer whenever, as the individual wrapping for each pod is quite handy.  There's nothing terribly distinctive about it- just a clean tasting coffee.  I will say this- I prefer it over the Starbucks Sumatra offered at work.  Recommended.",Excellent coffee in a great portable package,4

"Canned coffee-drinks, in my experience, can often miss the mark, but I'm happy to report that this Illy product tastes very good. In fact, it tastes almost exactly like a fresh iced-coffee with milk, with a hint of chocolate. It's sweet but not overwhelming. Of course, it's missing that classic coffee ""bitterness,"" (which, I suppose, a lot of people dislike anyway), but it's still definitely a beverage I'd be happy to drink two, or even three, at a time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these coffee-drinks are often a bit pricey, and Illy is no exception. Even buying a 12 pack here on Amazon, you're spending (as of this review) 23 cents per ounce, which is a lot for a beverage. In comparison, brewing an iced-coffee at home would cost a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />However, if you're willing to pay for it, then you can't go wrong here.

I tried the Earl grey because I wasn't sure I wanted 120 bags of peppermint tea.  When I got them, I tried them right away.  The quality was excellent, however, there is a slight mint flavor in the tea, which is not really common to an Earl Grey.

"i have purchased just about every coconut oil brand out there and find garden of life to be the best. other less expensive brands often leave an odd aftertaste or chemical residue even if they claim to be organic. i find this product to be consistently clean tasting. have been taking daily for over a year and have noticed improvement in skin, energy, immune system, and clarity of thought/memory. after initially feeling resistant to the idea of eating fat, i can't imagine life without this product. no weight gain at up to 3 tablespoons a day. don't let the medical establishment's misunderstanding about saturated fats scare you into not using this product. i have only benefited from it after years of low fat eating that was slowly destroying my health. but do start slowly, its not uncommon to feel a little nauseous( apparently as a result of being unused to digesting fats) or to have looser bowels initially( it has been used as a laxative).......",ranks above the rest,4

"I have type 2 diabetes and I eat one of these with a wedge of light Laughing Cow cheese about a half hour before dinner and the fiber helps fill me up and keeps my blood glucose from spiking after I eat dinner.<br /><br />I agree with one other reviewer that these can be tough on your digestive tract BUT ONLY at first. If your body isn't used to so much fiber at once it will ""rebel"" a bit but after eating one a day for about a week, all unpleasantness passed for me and they really do fill me up and help me eat less at dinner.<br /><br />Fiber helps keep my blood glucose stable without all the spikes that can stimulate appetite as well as cause my blood glucose to be above normal limits. Fiber acts like ""brakes"" to carbs and sugar.<br /><br />I always keep these in my pantry. They aren't the most tasty cracker I've ever had but they are palatable with the Laughing Cow cheese and it's an easy, quick way to add more fiber to your diet even if you aren't a diabetic.",Type 2 Diabetic - Helps Keep My Blood Glucose Stable,4

"Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids.

So, I have been purchasing these for a few years now, and both of my dogs like them (although the border collie has grown bored with them and will occassionaly reject them).  However, my concern is with the price of this product.  In Dec. 2008, I purchased this product (1 pound in a tub) for 10.99.  Now, in early february 2009, they have raised the priced to 18.55 - that has nearly doubled, so I won't be buying these unless the price drops back to somewhat reasonable.","In Jan. 2009, the price of these nearly doubled ... why?",4

I picked up this coffee for my husband because we recently was given a Keurig coffee maker.  I walked into the house this evening and he started raving about this coffee.  I was told that it is full bodied yet very smooth.  There is a slight astringency that adds a kick to the coffee.<br /><br />They aren't actually in cups but rather little bags with a hard top.  And it comes in 3 bags of 12 rather then in a box.  I can appreciate this fact especially since the savings is passed on to me the customer.

"First of all, in response to the query of why you would order this online posed by the reviewer below...not everyone lives near a Starbucks. Hard to believe I know, considering they seem to be on every street corner, but believe it or not there are still large sections of the US w/out Starbucks. So for those of us who want good coffee, Thank God for the internet & amazon. Verona is my favorite SB blend. It doesn't taste burnt as some of their coffee does to me. It has a boldness without being too dark & overwhelming, and it has subtle notes of chocolate without the icky sweetness of a flavored coffee. It makes a delicious cup of coffee.",My favorite Starbucks variety,4

"I've never been able to develop a taste for whole grain breads, even though I know they are better for you. I thought I'd give these a try anyway and I was pleasantly surprised. They have a fairly complex flavor, while still having all the sweetness you expect from graham crackers. My main issue with them is they break and crumble too easily, so harder to use for something like s'mores, but they worked great for a graham cracker crust for my cheesecake. A really tasty alternative, I'd definitely get these again.","Very tasty, even if you don't usually like whole grain",4

"I so like the flavor and texture of this rice! The texture is remarkable. I think the big plus is that the rice was sprouted before cooking, witch also adds nutritive value over un-sprouted steamed rice. It is so tender but not mushy, with a rich nutty flavor. This takes about a minute to heat and is easily packed for meals away from home.<br /><br /> The only reason I do not give it a full 5 stars is my sense of frugality. We all know how much less expensive it is to steam one's own rice. Paying $2.45 for about 15 cents worth of rice pushes my guilt buttons. That noted, for those who can afford it, or when it can be justified as a needed convenience, this is a terrific, whole, un-messed-with fast food.<br /><br />I currently justify the expense because easy access to wholesome food is of enough value to pay the balance. How much is good nutrition worth? Skip the fries and chips, zap a bowl of this. Maybe splash on some tamari and add some microwaved fresh mushrooms or zucchini, and you will be eating well and quickly, with minimum fuss.",Most tasty fast rice so far,4

"I am married to a coffee purist who will only drink black coffee and frequently turns up her nose at even flavored coffees such as Natural Fusions Vanilla from Starbucks. I on the other hand love to adulterate my coffee with cream, and especially flavored cream. It's not that don't enjoy black coffee--I do quite a bit--but that I also enjoy the robustness of coffee mingled with more subtle flavors. The best combinations are those which allow you to taste both the coffee and the added flavor, without one overpowering the other.<br /><br />This is my first exposure to Starbucks Natural Fusions, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to serve the coffee to a group of friends and see what we all thought of it (including my coffee-snob spouse!). The results were positive; everyone liked it, but certainly not rave reviews. My wife said ""I like it--for a flavored coffee it's not bad."" I thought it was tasty, just a hint of sweetness, and not overpowered with vanilla flavor. It did not have an oily feel like some bad flavored coffees I've run into in the past. Overall it was pleasant, tasty, and enjoyable, but perhaps not so good I'll be running out to the store to buy more. I'd give it a solid 3.5. I'll probably just go back to my usual Sumatra beans or Kona Blend, but this is a nice break from time to time.<br /><br />If you're a vanilla lover, or flavored coffee lover, I'd say it's certainly worth a try. If you're a coffee purist, you can safely skip it.",Likable but not spectacular,4

"So here's this thing. I've seen the rather catchy ads, but never tried the product until I got it from Vine. My impression? Yeah, it's not bad. It's not stupendous or anything, but it tastes reasonably good. I can see some effort would be needed to make sure one is getting exactly the right amount of flavor in ones drink, but that's really the only drawback I can think of. Well, that plus the fact that it seems a little steep price-wise.

"I'm a big tea drinker and am always looking for different flavors and varieties to try. Blackberry Vanilla is an aromatic combination; this tea is that and a flavorful drink, too. I steeped one tea pyramid in a cup of hot water for eight minutes (the box recommends six) and was surprised by the beautiful color and nice flavor: not too overwhelming taste of blackberries with vanilla sailing in after the first sip. This also makes a great iced tea.<br /><br />The biggest concern I had was when I read the ingredients on the side of the box. Like a previous reviewer said, the first ingredient is hibiscus--for a blackberry vanilla tea. How strange.<br /><br />Good for any occasion.",Yum!,4
"My absolute favorite. So smooth and not bitter at all.  With cream and sugar it tastes like premium coffee ice cream.  I use it in my small drip coffee maker, because I'm usually too busy to make with the espresso maker.  It tastes the same either way, just with less water.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that after drinking it every day for six months I developed heart palpitations. I previously was not a daily coffee drinker, so that probably has something to do with it, but I am only in my early thirties. They don't make a decaf version, and I have yet to find one that tastes as smooth.  So now it's only for special occasions, never days in a row.<br /><br />So if you are sure your heart is VERY healthy (I thought mine was before I had issues), go for it.  But tread lightly, and be sure to keep well hydrated.","excellent taste, decaf please",4

"I don't care if it is just juice concentrate, reconstituted with carbonated water instead of plain water -- the stuff tastes good!  The carbonation makes it taste nice and light, instead of super-sweet or -strong like many juices.  As a heartfelt devourer of all things cherry, I really liked this Switch black cherry drink.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was so tasty, so light, so refreshing, that I easily could have knocked down three or four of these SMALL 8.3 ounce cans.  However, seeing as the primary ingredient is (reconstituted) APPLE juice (that's right, NOT cherry!) and the tiny can has 130 Calories of sugars (natural to the juice, I'm sure, but still) - it is probably a good thing the can is so small, or I'd have had 500 calories just like that!  Even Coke only has about 100 calories per 8 ounces!<br /><br />Anyway, Switch tastes awesome.  When I get more, I want to try it as a mixer with vodka.

"*Warning* These chips are like eating a raw habanero pepper.<br /><br />This is literally the hottest processed food product I've ever eaten.

I can barely get down 10 chips before my nose and eyes are watering and my mouth is on fire. I'd compare their taste, texture, and crunchiness to Tim's Cascade Jalapeno (which I love,) but they're probably around 5 times as hot as those chips. Don't get me wrong, these things are pretty tasty, but I'm still working on polishing off my first bag that I received 3 days ago.<br /><br />I'm probably going to keep some for myself to eat, since they don't go bad for a year from now, but the others I'm probably going to use for pranks on my family and friends.

"First of all, these little cans are NOT fine dining.  It is, after all, a $2.50 snack.  That said, for $2.50--I love these things.

Sounds pretty natural, and it packs only 140 calories.

Its liquid properties have a soft texture and it does leave a weak aftertaste in your mouth. It is good and not very sweet, but I still needed some water after finishing the can.<br /><br />The packaging looks a little ""sporty"" that kind of defeats its supposed exotic image.

"For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide.

At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy.

I look for grain free food only as my sight hound is mostly raw meat fed.  In the AM she needs something to take up the extra bile her very acid belly produces.

"Note: I snipped open the pod and tasted this coffee after preparing it properly, not in a pod.<br />""<br />This is the ""organic medium ethiopia yirgacheffe"" (really).<br /><br />I like a light roast; a fruity columbian.  It may be that I am reacting to the omnipresence of that bitter, over-roasted stuff Starbucks pours. Well, this Marley blend is bitter as well, but intrinsically so, with a tongue-slapping sting. I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.<br /><br /> I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months. Use good coffee. Marley's is packed in foil and tasted fairly fresh.","Bitter Brew, and that's good",4

"Product was packaged very well. 2 separate flats with the k-cups nestled firmly into their own spots. Our previous bulk k-cups were just dumped into an amazon box. They even took the time to align the print on the k-cups so it was all facing the same way in the flats.<br />Was a bit unpleasantly surprised by the inclusion of 8 Decaf cups in the first flat (luckily only 2 in the second) Wish they would have mentioned that in the description because that makes 10 of these k-cups totally useless to me and my wife, and cuts down on the value of buying in bulk. The incredible variety of the pack though nulls out the useless decaf in my opinion. We have been drinking the exact same k-cups for the last year so the variety is welcome.",Decaf surprise! -1 star,4
"I tested two flavors of Switch soda, and I liked the Black Cherry flavor the best.  The first sip made my taste buds start dancing; it was full of flavor. Not the super-sweet, overcompensating with sugar to cover up the lack of real taste kind of flavor, either.<br /><br />Have you ever eaten a pile of chilled cherries on a hot summer afternoon? If so, you'll know that every so often, one of the small fruits ripens to a deeper flavor than the others.  You'll be snacking along, and then... BAM! that one special cherry makes you sit up and take notice.  Well, that is what the first taste of Switch is like.<br /><br />Maybe my taste buds went into overload, and shut down, because the flavor-palooza didn't last.  My last sip was good, and I enjoyed the drink, but it just didn't deliver that same ""punch"" with every tip of the wrist.<br /><br />This soda is what I'd call ""lightly carbonated"".  I find that a plus, as it's not burp-inducing. But, if you're looking for a fruit-fizzy, you might be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a nice Switch from the usual soft drink fare and it's full of healthy goodness. I don't think I would enjoy drinking this everyday, but for an occasional treat, it's lovely.","The first sip was divine.  After that, more mundane.",4

"As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!",Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig,4
"This is not my favorite k-Cup offering out there, but it's not too bad.  I felt the flavor didn't live up to my expectations of ""espresso"", it wasn't bold enough for me.  It starts out with a nice flavor, but ends with too much bitterness and not enough boldness.  I drink it black, so I'm sure some cream would soften the bitterness.  I wanted more flavor, something that left me with that flavor on my tongue after a cup similar to the experience with a cup of espresso coffee.  I didn't get that, just a lingering bitterness.","A nice blend, needs more developed flavor",4

"Until recently, I had never heard of the brand `Izze', much less their line of Sparkling Juice beverages.  When Amazon Vine posted a request to review them, however, my interest was most certainly piqued, being a sucker for anything fruit-flavored.  My only dilemma revolved around what flavor to order.  They all look so interesting to me, but I deliberated between the three flavors I found most intriguing:  Blackberry, Pomegranate, and Clementine.<br /><br />I finally decided on the Clementine.  When a case of twenty-four arrived at my office, I had plenty to share with a couple of friends, and after chilling a few cans, we enjoyed our first taste of this unusual libation together.<br /><br />We all enjoyed it, although I think I liked it more than the other two.  However, I've been to wine tastings with this pair of friends, and I notice they don't usually care for sparkling wine either, which leaves me to wonder if it was the effervescence that they didn't like rather than the flavor.  As for me, I adore sparkling beverages, so this is right up my alley.<br /><br />The Clementine flavor tastes just like the fruit, although I admit I had expected a slightly sweeter drink than the Izze turned out to be.  The label on the can states it is ""naturally flavored"", and that is exactly what I got.  My belief that it would be sweeter is probably borne of the fact that most commercial beverages do have more sugar added.  Because of this, the slightly tart taste was a bit startling, but after the first few sips I truly appreciated the freshness of it.<br /><br />In fact, I enjoyed the Clementine flavor so much that I went looking for the Izze beverages in the local stores, and succeeded in finding both of the other flavors I wanted to try: Pomegranate and Blackberry.  Of all of them, I think the Blackberry is probably my favorite, although the Clementine is a close second.  I think the Blackberry wins by a nose strictly because it is such an uncommon flavor for a beverage, and that appeals to me as much as the flavor itself does.  It helps that I adore blackberries, though.<br /><br />The Pomegranate was my least favorite of the three, and I don't believe I'll buy it again, although I did drink all four cans in the pack that I purchased.  The flavor was slightly bitter, although it does grow on you after a few swallows.  But once again, it does taste very close to eating the pomegranate fruit.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the Izze drinks.  I will most certainly be purchasing both the Clementine and Blackberry flavors in the future.","Refreshing, unusual, and natural",4

"I have a rather large container garden outside on my lanai (anywhere from 75-100 pots and planters depending on what I've got growing). Pests *can* be a problem, especially mealybugs. I usually treat with either tons of power misting from the hose (takes care of almost all pests- do it several days in a row and it usually eliminates the problem altogether) or Safer spray products, because I try to be mindful of environmental factors. Plus we live right on a bay and we've got three cats who roam the lanai and a bunch of tiny lizards and frogs that live *in* and among the plants.<br /><br />However, every so often the pests get out of control (mealybugs.... ARGH) and the eco-friendly options don't do anything, and instead of tossing ten plants, I have to get something stronger. I like these Bayer spikes because I can control the application. I like that they are buried in the soil and treat from the inside out. I also can control how much water I give the plant after the spike has been buried, so that there's no runoff. It's a VERY controlled pest control solution.<br /><br />However, unless you are growing plants in pots the size of teacups, you will need multiple spikes per plant. I can usually treat about 2-3 plants per pack, which isn't really a great bargain. However, if you have an infestation on a prized plant, this might be a good option instead of dousing the plant with liquid chemicals or pouring in gradules on the surface of the soil, which will likely be run off when you water.<br /><br />So be aware you won't get much use from one pack, and there are much safer options, but if you are looking for a controlled way to kill pests from the INSIDE and not be applying toxic chemicals to the surface of the plant and soil and area surrounding, this is a great option.",be warned- you need multiple spikes per plant,4

"I have the DVD, and added the Blue-Ray.  A very good movie.  It is very re-watchable. It's also a good opportunity to view some famous actors in much younger days.  A much younger Alec Baldwin is hardly recognizable. Michael Keaton really isn't recognizable due to the makeup used, even though he played a great part.  Wynona Ryder plays a great part as always.  Gina Davis and Catherine O'Hara played their parts well.  Although the PQ was very good, I really didn't see any appreciable improvement in the PQ or Audio, over the earlier DVD.  I have a 5.1 system, with Polk Speakers.<br /><br />There is only one disc. There was no paper insert. The separate audio soundtrack (on the same Blue-Ray disc), failed to play on my Panasonic BD60 (with all firmware updates). Everything else played.  If you have the DVD, I don't see any benefit in getting the Blue-Ray.  I guess that's why the price dropped to close to single digits.  I'm really starting to question the benefits of Blue-Ray over DVDs.  In most Blue-Ray movies, I've watched, extras, present on earlier releases, have been removed.  I thought that was a major selling point in the Blue-Ray movement.",Blueray:  Great movie.  Blue-Ray-Okay,4
"This is the ONLY sugar free syrup that my husband and I can tolerate eating. It actually tastes pretty good. We believe the key to this is that this syrup is sweetened with Splenda. My husband still preferes the Mrs. Butterworth extra butter and Aunt Jemima butter rich, but will still choose this Maple Grove Farms butter flavor if he's watching his calories on that particular week. Is this the best flavored syrup in the world to eat? No. My first choice would be home-made syrup like my dad used to make when we were kids ... but we believe that Maple Grove Farms' Sugar Free Butter Flavor sweetened with Splenda is the best tasting sugar free syrup out there. We also can't figure out if Amazon's price is listed for an individual bottle (which we believe it is, but is over twice what we pay locally) or if the price is for a case of syrup (which we think would make it too much of a price savings). So, since it isn't listed as a case, we will unfortunately continue to try to find it locally for normal prices. It's always out of stock recently on our shopping day, which has lead us here in the first place during our search for syrup. I guess next time it's in stock downtown, we'll buy a case while we're there. Or perhaps I'll try the family recipe with Splenda and see what happens after the smoke clears. :)",Make sure it's sweetened with Splenda ... :),4
"There's nothing wrong with being ""mild and understated."" None of the tastes in this treat jump out at you but, instead, they're a good blend of several flavors and textures.

"We started with good ole pure cane sugar but medical and weight issues soon brought a plethora of substitutes for the original.  The search for the perfect artificial sweetener has not been without its hills and valleys.  The pink packets are just plain awful, the blue packets are a great improvement but a little on the chemical side, the yellow packets are not quite as sweet but a much better flavor and can be used easily in cooking.  Now we have the orange packets.  I am always up to try something new and glad to see a sweetener that is 100% natural after all the chemical controversy about other products.  However, my Nectresse results were mixed.  The flavor of Nectresse is definitely sweeter than Splenda (its parent company) and the Nectresse seems to pleasingly cut some of the bitterness in my super strong French roast coffee.  But the large grain size makes it less easy to shake evenly over cereal, yogurt or fruit and makes it quite difficult to dissolve.  The cold cereal test was not very successful for the same reason -- the Nectresse did not dissolve in the cold milk and was left as a super sweet residue in the bottom of the bowl.  If I don't do a lot of stirring while it is hot, it also does not dissolve well in the hot coffee.  It is unclear from the package whether it would work well and retain its sweetness in baking or cooking as Splenda (the yellow packet) does.  So I have a mixed review -- great taste but not so easy to use.",Good but not great,4

"Stevia is sweeter than sugar, so you only use a small fraction of the amount compared with sugar. Like most non-sugar sweeteners, stevia does not taste exactly like sugar. It took me and my husband a week or so to get used to the taste. He now prefers it to sugar in his coffee. I have tried other stevia brands, but SweetLeaf has been my favorite. The addition of fiber helps to add some body to the powder, without adding things I don't want (some other brands use lactose). I really like that it is a zero calorie sweetener, yet is made from a plant, not a chemical.<br /><br />Because it is much sweeter than sugar and has a different consistency, I have not yet figured out how to accurately bake with it. Adding small amounts to sweeten pancakes or pasta sauce works fine, but baking cookies or cakes just doesn't work at all.","A little goes a long way, not for baking",4

"I first bought this tea from Whole Foods when I was beginning a fast. When I looked at the ingredients, I knew that I would barely be able to stand the taste (just the sight of the word 'licorice' made me want to gag), but I've always loved Yogi teas and if it did what it read on the description of he box, I was willing to give it a go. Sure enough, when I just cracked open the box, the scent was unbelievably overwhelming, unpleasant and I knew it would taste just as awful. It  did.<br /><br />However, it does do exactly what it reads on the box and then some! It really does the job when it comes to quelling my appetite and it feels like I just got a shot of B-12 (maybe it's just because I actually do chug it lol).  In one review, the reviewer said that they drink it bedtime. Although it's caffeine-free, I personally get so, so much natural energy from it, I would suggest drinking it during the daytime and see how it effects you.<br /><br />I've kept drinking it after the fast, because of it's health benefits, it's appetite AND craving suppression and the natural energy boost that it provides.

The second is there is a rawhide shell filled with something.,  It seems like a lot for little dogs.  For the time being, I've been cutting them smaller on the band-saw, however you can only go so small before you fear they will swallow it whole.

"I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.<br /><br />Out of the bag, the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity.

This Baby Gourmet product is a high-quality product, manufactured in Canada, and certified organic by QAI and USDA, it is made from organic, all-natural ingredients (organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinic, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), organic lemon juice concentrate). There are no added fillers, added sugars, or any artificial additives. The taste is good, with about the consistency and color of apple sauce. It's got enough sweetness to make the blend palpable. The broccoli does have an overcooked taste to it however.<br /><br />The soft pouch is durable, compact, and portable. It's ready to serve warm or cold. To serve warm, stand in some hot water for a few minutes, or microwave the contents in a separate bowl. The pouch itself is not microwavable. Nutritionally, this product doesn't contain much besides Vitamin A (25%) and Vitamin C (70%). Protein is 2%, Iron 2%, Calcium 0% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />It is gluten-free, nut-free, daily/egg/lactose free, and kosher. As the cap is a choking hazard, parents need to keep it away from baby. Additionally, the edges of the pouch are very stiff, which may poke sensitive baby parts.","Good tasting, portable, and convenient",4
"Although it's not much more than a drinkable vitamin, the benefits of EBOOST drink packets include ease of use, great taste, and the fact that they encourage you to hydrate. And the vitamin benefits of course!  I don't personally buy-in to the whole ""improve your focus and boost your performance"" thing, but if you're like most Americans, you're lacking in vitamins and minerals, so drinking this can only help.<br /><br />The Acai Pomegranate is delicious; not too sweet, not too sour, and not overwhelmingly ""fake fruity"" flavoured. I recommend drinking this very cold; the closer it gets to room temp, the more you can taste the vitamins. With ice, you can hardly taste the ""healthiness"" at all!<br /><br />I love the simply slender packs because they're easy to carry in a bag, pocket, etc. and you can toss them in a desk drawer at the office. I don't love the eco factor of single-serve packs in general, BUT I took some solace in seeing that EBOOST is a member of 1% for the Planet, so at least they're giving back.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the earlier reviews re. mixability, foam, etc., although it didn't bother me nearly as much as it did others.  I also mixed it with more than 8oz of water and it was fine - in fact better, in my opinion.","Delicious, healthy, easy... yes please!",4

"I usually drink tap water and can only compare this to that experience. I used to drink city water which was treated with Chlorine which I would purify using a Brita water pitcher. That allowed me to review the harsher chemical elements from the taste. This water, since it is pre-filtered, lacks such chemical tastes out of the bottle, of course, but the first sip carried a salty taste reminiscent of bicarbonate of soda. This quickly dissipated and then it really didn't taste like much of anything, which is how water should be.<br /><br />Others have talked about a ""silky"" taste, but that is really about the mouth feel of the water (the equivalent of texture in food). If you are the sort of person who really attends to the experience of drinking water, this may be of value to you, but I think most people are drinking water for hydration, not for its taste or feel. The health benefits are something that I think one cannot measure. You can either take their word for whether or not the pH levels or electrolytes are helpful or not as it'd take a long term study to really know.<br /><br />If you're going to drink bottled water anyway, this would be a nice choice. If you are mixing water with other things and are sensitive to chemicals from other types of water purification, this may also be a good option. However, for most people, I'm guessing that they'd be just as happy with filtered tap water. I know that I will be.",tastes a little salty at first,4

"I skipped trying this with the water recipe; other reviews already said it was better with milk (and I suspected as much). I made it with lactose-free milk (I can't tolerate it) and it was delicious! It has some instant coffee for flavor, but not enough. Just now, I tried adding it straight into my coffee, and it is also tasty. I would imagine the best way to prepare this is to make it with hot milk and add shots of espresso (assuming you have a machine). It is not too many calories, and just sweet enough without being sugary (which is the problem with drinks from places like Starbucks-way too much sugar!)<br />I don't know if I would pay $8 for this, but then again it has ~17 servings, and one can really only get 1-2 drinks at a coffee shop for that price.","Tasty, but not very coffee-y",4

"There are a couple of different aspects of this product.  The first being the food itself.  Simple, organic, healthy, as much as it can be anyways and still be shelf stable.  The expiration dates seem to be short, which is reassuring that there are not many additives in it, however you might want to keep your eye on it.<br /><br />The packaging is the other aspect of this.  Since you can easily squeeze it out on to a spoon without touching the spoon, you can easily seal this up and use it again without worrying about bacteria from your child's mouth.  The alternative is the kid could just eat the food directly, which is great if the kid can do it and is going to eat it all anyways.  This makes it great for on the go.<br /><br />I don't think there are many downsides, unless your child doesn't like the greens mixed with the pear, since it does make the taste a bit strange (at least to my adult palette).","No mess, easy reuse, great for on the run",4

"We eat 'slow cook' oatmeal, because it has more fiber and nutrients, so my wife is used to cooking our oatmeal longer.  Most people are used to instant oatmeal which you just add hot water to.  Neither slow cook or steel cut are like that.  So, if you don't like taking the extra time to cook your oatmeal don't get steel cut.<br /><br />The oatmeal has a geat flavor, and is very filling.  It may have a completely different texture from any oatmeal you'ver ever eaten.  Several people have stated that it has a nutty texture and nutty flavor, they're correct.  Our whole family loves the taste.<br /><br />My only complaint isn't with the oatmeal, but with Amazon's packaging.  Several other buyers complained about this, so I was aware of it.  They put the oatmeal in a box bigger than it needed to be and then didn't pack the oatmeal firmly.  So, the cans moved around and knocked into each other during shipment.  We ordered 2 (pack of 4) sets, and they were shipped separately, although they arrived one day apart.  Of the 8 cans we received only 4 made it without blemish.  One was badly dented, and 3 slightly dented.  So, if you are getting the oatmeal in the cans with hopes of giving them as gifts, or something along those lines, be aware that you may not be able to do so.<br /><br />All things considered I would buy the steel cut oatmeal again.","Great Oatmeal, Poor Shipping",4

"Wow - there are VERY mixed reviews for this item! After reading a bulk of them, I still decided to order the product because I didn't know of another way to try a variety of flavors without buying a box of each. The description above states that you will be able to try 27 different flavors of coffee without buying 27 different boxes (they must have changed the description, since a few of the reviews state that it reads 35 different varieties). After tallying them all up, I only ended up with 21 different varieties (sigh). I use the word ""varieties"" and not ""flavors"" because I did receive several French Vanillas and Hazelnuts, but they were from different companies. My cups also came packaged in a box, so perhaps they've done away with the paper bag thing?<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what I received: Green Mountain: Wild Mountain Blueberry (2), Southern Pecan (2), French Vanilla Iced (2), Caramel Vanilla Cream (2), Mocha Nut Fudge (2), Island Coconut (2), Hazelnut Noisette, Hazelnut Decaf, French Vanilla, French Vanilla Decaf/ Donut House: Chocolate Glazed Donut (2), Cinnamon Roll (2)/ Grove Square: Hazelnut Cappuccino (2), French Vanilla Cappuccino (2), Caramel Cappuccino (2)/ Gloria Jean's: Mudslide (2), Butter Toffee (2), Hazelnut, French Vanilla Supreme/ Wolfgang Puck: Hawaiian Hazelnut Aloha Noisette/ Timothy's: Kahlua Original (2).<br /><br />These just came today, so I have only tried the Green Mountain Island Coconut so far - over ice (I don't drink hot coffee...I know, weird, right?).

I find this a pleasant alternative tea and like it better than any other English Breakfast tea I've tried.<br /><br />BTW, I also sometimes add 10 drops of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TQIJ94"">Sinus Formula 1oz</a> to the tea which not only opens my sinuses, but gives it a nice minty taste.",I liked it better than their other ones,4

"This is what I wanted: Solo brand almond paste. In conjunction with other purchases, it shipped for free, and it was cheaper than anything I can get locally (Florida panhandle). What I found odd is that the cans arrived loosely rolling in a box with some bubble wrap. I had wondered about the four-can ""case,"" but hadn't wanted to look a gift horse in the mouth.

"I really like the idea of a food source that isn't chicken, turkey or beef raised in feed lots, but it is much more practical to plant a prize winning garden and wait for some rabbits to move in and eat up your prized plants, and then sneak out and tag a few with lightweight transmitter collars in the middle of the night.<br /><br />That way, you have a wild, free range food source.  Your herd will get the best free food possible by going out and eating all of your neighbors flowers.  Marigolds really impart something great to the flavor of the meat.  Sunflower plants also give them a really nice mild flavor.<br /><br />That way, it cost you nearly nothing (except of course the cost and toil of raising your lovely garden initially) to have a readily available and fresh food source at hand.<br /><br />With the radio collars, you can easily track where your herd is currently foraging.  Whether it be down the street on cranky old Mrs. Hagersteins prized flower, or on your hippie neighbors cherished ""Organic and sustainable"" vegan garden.<br /><br />Plus, everyone knows that wild, so called ""nuisance"" pests are the absolute lowest fat, and have the best diet.<br /><br />Good idea though, all the same!  I just like my food source to be ""free range"".<br /><br />Mark :)","I like the idea of a new food source, but I choose to let my bunnies free range.",4
"The box says it's ""one of the most sophisticated blends you'll ever enjoy. Borrowing berry flavors from African beans, a full body from Indonesian beans, and a subtle smokiness from a touch of French Roast, this blend represents a spectacular tapestry of flavors carefully woven together.""  It's still a smooth tasting coffee even with all of those descripters.  This coffee actually brings together 4 different coffees from 3 different continents.<br /><br />Actually, this coffee would be for someone who likes a smooth cup of coffee, it's comparable to Folger's medium roast.  You can still add your french vanilla creamer and sweeteners with no problem.  It doesn't cause the coffee to go bitter.

"I believe these thing work, however only the male moths.  (so no reproduction)  The story to getting them is a pain...  I purchased them, they were sent, and I never got them UPS.

He sent me the tracking # and told me UPS tried to deliver but I had ""moved"".  So I contacted UPS and gave them a piece of my mind.  He and I have still been in contact regarding receipt of them and he has ever offered to reimburse me the shipping, which I believe is UPS's responsibility.  He was a very professional and good person to deal with.  UPS, on the other hand, even sent me a postcard to the address of which they ""tried"" but discovered I'd ""moved"".

"I put these in my cart and thought on 'em for quite a long while.  $17 seemed like a lot of money to spend on something I'd never tried before.  Sure, I've had some of the hulled (or white) sesame seeds on buns and such, but I was less certain of this ""heartier"" unhulled variety.  I mean, what was I going to DO with all those seeds?  Well, my concerns were quickly put aside when my quartet of bagged seeds arrived.  Describing the taste is tricky; the bag says they ""have a nutty, slightly sweet flavor and aroma that is enhanced by toasting.""  Me thinks Bob's Red Mill didn't know how to describe them either! I detect nothing sweet and notice an almost slightly smoky flavor. And I can say this: they've grown on me.  I eat them straight, in cereal with milk, in homemade granola and added to baked goods.  They're really quite versatile.  I haven't made Tahini yet, but there's a recipe right on the package and one for Hummus and a third for cookies.  Unhulled, i.e., brown sesame seeds have a higher Calcium content (16% RDA in 2 tbsp) than hulled, which is the primary reason I wanted these, but they also are a good source of Iron (13%) and Magnesium.  They keep best refrigerated or frozen - and happily since I'm dealing with 4 pounds of product, the expiration date is two years off.

"Like most people who routinely buy organic products, I'm accustomed to mark-ups in the 10% to 50% range. I usually think it's worth it to know what I'm ingesting. Thus, I would overlook the price of Organic Valley Organic Nonfat Dry Milk Powder were it not for the fact that getting the powder to dissolve in water is nearly impossible. Per the instructions on the package, I used cold (chilled) water. I tried shaking it vigorously - again, per package instructions - to no avail. ""Put it in the fridge for a while so it can dissolve,"" I thought. Bad idea. When I took it out, the undissolved lumps of powder had formed a crust the exact consistency of Spackle on the surface of the water. ""Ah, a whisk! That'll do the trick,"" was my next bright idea. No, the lumps of Spackle adhered to the wires of the whisk with a large mass of partially dissolved powder stuck accumulating in the center.

I recently had to get the normal greenies because they were out of Lite and my dog wouldn't go near them; thank goodness I purchased the normal ones at a place where they took returns.<br /><br />I give my guy a few throughout the day as treats so I just bend and twist them in half; otherwise my dachshund/pekingese mix will demand more and at roughly $30 a box, I'd go broke if I gave him as many as he could eat. As long as the box is fresh, the greenies will be nice and bendable... I have purchased a box on a few occasions where the greenies were rock hard.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price. I just wish they were a tad lower. Even still, I will keep buying these as they're my dog's fave treats.",Love 'em!,4
"The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.<br />So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts ""dancing"".<br />I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again.",Good but very small,4
"Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously, these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!",The Best I've Found So Far,4
"Good stuff. I despise the taste of processed sweetners and I was hesitant about what they would taste like, but I was not disappointed. They are very good. Highly recommended.",Do NOT taste like sugar free cookies.,4

"My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from ""crisp and delicious"" to ""overpowering and slightly off-putting"". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.","After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.",4
"With it's well balanced spices and deliciously tangy aftertaste this is what I like to put on a bacon sandwich.<br />Save the ketchup for chicken and fries.<br />It also lend's itself well to being an extra spicy kick to soups, casseroles and bolognese, just add whilst cooking.<br />I always have a bottle in my house, why don't you.","Ooh, You Are Saucy.",4
"They are kind of dried out, but that means that it doesn't stink like pee when the dogs chew on them.  The dogs don't like them quite as much as regular bully sticks, but they like them better than rawhide (and my roommates prefer these to regular bully sticks due to the smell).  Plus they are also safer for young dogs than rawhide.<br /><br />They are far cheaper than you can get them elsewhere, so it is also worth getting 1 or 2 that are really scrawny looking (the rest look like the smaller ones that you'd get at the pet store).","Not very fresh, but that has its advantages",4
Good product,Nice product,4
"My kids love this milk.  I love it because it doesn't have to be refrigerated until the night before it goes in the lunch box, so it's not taking up space.  And it's organic and healthy.  I wish it was a little less expensive and this keeps us from ordering it on a more regular subscribe and save basis.  It is a great product, though.",Great for lunch boxes,4
"As someone who's trying to eliminate sugar from her diet, I absolutely loved this. It's every bit as sweet as regular Splenda, but with the added benefit of B vitamins that many of us don't get enough of. I didn't notice any vitamin taste or smell as other reviewers apparently experienced, not even when I sprinkled an entire packet over one sliced strawberry. (Sweet tooth attack.)<br /><br />That said, I think it's important to remember that each packet contains 20% of the RDA for vitamins B1, B5 and B6. If you're a hard-core Splenda user, you should probably only use a couple of these packets per day since it IS possible to overdose on B vitamins. While B vitamins are water soluble, and most people simply pee out any excess, people with liver problems (NAFL, fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis and various other conditions) and people with kidney problems don't eliminate excess vitamins as efficiently as others and should be careful when taking more than the recommended daily amount of ANY vitamin.",Same Great Splenda Taste!,4

Great product, but it doesnt last long!",Excellent Protein,4
The best way to have this is half a cup of it blended with ice and two shots of espresso. Takes like a white chocolate cooler. I would not recommend using this as an addition to hot drinks. It gets lost in the coffee and milk but shines when blended with ice and espresso as mentioned before. I worked in a coffee shop and we used it only for cold drinks and syrup for the hot since syrup seems to blend better in warm beverages and holds its flavor better.,"Goes great with cold beverages, not hot",4
"This is a tasty product, but the label can be misleading. It is a thin chocolate COOKIE and not a thin chocolate mint CANDY.<br /><br />Each box has the cookies wrapped in a sleeve, which once opened will require the cookies to be stored in another container to maintain freshness.<br /><br />Since they are thin, these cookies can't take rough handling. They break easily.",A COOKIE not a CANDY,4

"Currently, I can buy a 6-ounce can of jumbo pitted olives at Food Lion for $2.49. These are a bit more expensive per ounce, even on a subscription basis. However, I've weighed a number of factors and just now ordered a second lot of these ahead of schedule. Aside from price, here are the things I considered:<br /><br />1. These are at least as good as any other black olives I have tried.<br /><br />2. The sizing is much more convenient. Using an entire 6-ounce can at once is often not very convenient. Suppose I just need smaller amounts for stir fry or salads? In the end, using one of these cans serves my purposes better and is more economical than the bigger store-bought cans.<br /><br />3. While I can certainly chop whole olives myself, this product saves me the trouble. And there IS a certain elegance to having neatly sliced olives, especially when presentation makes a difference.<br /><br />4. I'm pretty lazy, and it's hot outside. Sometimes it's nice to just push a button and wait for UPS to drop things on my doorstep.",Pretty good alternative to store olives,4

Not bad tasting at all.  Sometimes I want to drink something that isn't water and that is when Crystal Light comes in.  Its Kool-aid for adults right?  What's more adult than a mocktale that you might be able to add tequila to and make it a real treat.  Forget the latter and stick with just assuming it's another flavor of drink. Put it right up there with grape on the tastey chart.<br /><br />I think it is rather tasty. It was refreshing and bright.<br /><br />Adding Jose tequila to it made it taste bad.  I didn't like it at all.<br /><br />Good mocktale.<br />Bad cocktale.,Not a mocktail but still nice.,4

"It's OK, but not really different in flavor or aroma from the huge jugs of Kikkoman Soy Sauce I buy at Costco. It is quite savory, thankfully without sweetness, it is subtle on salt... but there is really not much to add to that. Don't expect any exciting cherry/oak/smokiness undertones. It is quite ordinary, and not any different from the cheaper variety sold by the same company, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",It's OK,4

I'm currently training for the Chicago Marathon, and I've had Gu with me since my first ""long"" run of 6 miles. I recently finished a 20 mile run with 4 gels in my fuel belt, and I'll say that these things are a necessity for any run over an hour.

Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.",Pretty intense,4

We have been buying Ass Kickin Chili Fixins for a number of years and really like it.  We have used for gifts to friends who want our recipe.  WARNING: Use the ground habanero pepper packet sparingly.  We measured it out and only used 1/4 tsp. and our chili was plenty hot.  You can always add more but you can't take it out once you have it in the pot.  Sour Cream and cheese for toppings were perfect.,Great Chili to serve a crowd,4
"The addition of extras in our regular foods has been around for ages - Vitamin D in our milk, more vitamins added to our dry cereal, fluoride to our toothpaste, and now fiber to our sweetener.<br /><br />I use Splenda every day in my coffee and iced tee, so I expected to be able to tell some difference between the regular stuff and this new version, but I can't. The flavor is exactly the same, it dissolves into hot and cold liquids the same.<br /><br />The only difference I can see is the packaging. The regular package is paper, this new package is foil-lined, making it a bit more difficult to shake the contents down, and more difficult to rip open. It's not a huge issue, but I really wish they'd used the regular paper packets instead of these new ones.<br /><br />If I was lacking fiber in my diet, these would be an easy way to add it back. Since I eat a ton of fiber anyway, I probably won't purchase these again. If the packaging and pricing was the same for both, then I'd seriously consider buying these over the regular Splenda, but with the added hassle of the foil-lined pack, I'll stick with the regular Splenda.",Tastes exactly the same as the regular Splenda,4
"Growing up in San Francisco, home of Mrs. Fields's cookies, I have a very healthy appreciation of soft cookies.  Couple this with the fact that many packaged cookies that you find at the super-market is pretty stiff and crumbly, I'm generally apprehensive when I hear about the words ""gooey"" and ""soft"" when describing such cookies.  Regular Chips Ahoy is no exception, unfortunately.  I do, however, appreciate their chunky chocolate cookies (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VMW1QA"">Chips Ahoy! Chunky Chocolate Chunk cookies, 13-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>), especially the peanut butter ones (don't see them on amazon, though).  Therefore, when I saw the new Chewy Gooey line of cookies, I had hope that this new generation of cookies would continue their improving trend!<br /><br />Sure enough, the cookies were soft.  I wouldn't say that the chocolate was able to stretch like on the main package, but there's definitely more chocolate in these new cookies than in your standard Chips Ahoy.  It's almost like a filling lay, and definitely not just chips being melted more during the baking process.  Honestly, they're strictly not even chocolate chips anymore, more like a fudge.<br /><br />And the big question, are they tasty?  Definitely.  Are they messier?  Yeah, so be even more careful giving them to little kids (or even my 10 year old, who happens to still eat with her hands when we aren't looking).<br /><br />Recommended.  If only they'd bump up the package size closer to the 12-14 ounce of the earlier packages (or even better, make them 16 ounces again!!!!!)  Then I'd give them 5 stars!","Pretty good, soft cookies!",4
"great candy, just as you would get in the store, however they came shipped in a corrugated cardboard carton direct from jelly belly without a liner ( literally, the candy was just in the box with nothing else- no plastic bag, etc), which was a bit off-putting.

It also contains guarana and ginseng, which can help boost energy. It has zero calories in a serving and 60 milligrams of caffeine, which is about the same amount of caffeine as in a 6 ounce cup of coffee.

They do contain two different kinds of crackers, and I would prefer that they put something different in besides one type of crackers.  As it is, my son doesn't eat one of the packages of crackers, and I supplement this lunch with some kind of vegetable (celery sticks or carrot sticks) to give a slightly better balance.<br /><br />That is really my only criticism, I guess.

"Personally I like to brew loose leaf tea and don't use tea bags.  I decided to try this out and compare it with my usual loose leaf tea - Lipton.  Don't laugh but Lipton is quite good tea and is very inexpensive.  I found the difference between the two very subtle. I find my loose leaf Lipton to be very refreshing and having a clean taste.  The Higgins & Burke English BreakFast Black Tea I found refreshing but having a ""dusty"" or ""grainy"" aftertaste.  What I mean by that is I think the tea in the H&B bags is ground too fine and some passes into the brewed tea thereby giving it a ""dusty"" or ""grainy"" aftertaste. It is surprising because the bag they use seems to be superfine mesh, much more than in you standard tea bag. So it appears to me that in the product that I got some of the tea was powdered in the bag and was able to pass through the fine mesh.

It occurs naturally in some fruits and fermented foods & is 60-70% as sweet as table sugar, but is almost noncaloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay & is less likely to cause gastric side effects than other sugar alcohols.

My family likes spicy foods for the most part and we prefer freshly ground pepper over the other store bought products.  So we decided to buy a new salt and pepper grinder as well as salt and pepper to use in the grinders. We chose Badia Gourmet blend because of the different peppers used in the blend.

Not offensive but doesn't ""give"" like the common brand. The color is not as deep as the common brand but does definitely scream chocolate. The flavor is mildly sweet, just enough so. To transition myself off of the chemical laden brand, I put a squirt, (a tsp or so) of chocolate sauce in my cereal. My kids know something is up  and haven't tried this yet.

"I saw that the Amazon price ordering 6 at a time was much cheaper, so I tried it.

"Truthfully these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GK"">Honey Maid Fresh Stacks</a> couldn't have arrived at a better time.  Our two-year old Grandson was visiting recently and these became his favorite snack. Each and every time the pantry was opened we heard ""Cracker, please?"".  What I appreciated most besides it being the same graham cracker I remembered, was the new packaging. Many times I have opened a larger pack only to not finish them and end up finding stale crackers the next time. With these smaller packs we are more likely to finish a pack, but if we don't they easily fit into a ziploc sandwich bag. The are also PERFECT for smores; just grab a pack of crackers, some chocolate and a bag of marshmallows! You can even make them easy (and fun!) at home with this: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001447LEE"">Microwavable S'Mores Maker</a>.  The only negative about these would be the cost.  Being a new product here on Amazon, they are a bit higher priced than most would want to pay.  If they were to be included in Subscribe & Save, then it would be a bit more reasonable.  My suggestion for now would be to look locally, I found them in my local grocery store for about $1.15 less per box.","On old favorite, in new packaging",4

"I previously purchased Natural Value Unbleached Wax Sandwich bags which I will give points for being longer (7 13/16"" over 7 1/2"") than this brand If You Care. This is slightly more expensive per bag, but I think the If You Care brand is a better quality paper. Overall, I like the feel of this bag better as it feels more like paper, less waxy. It also seems thicker and more durable. In the past 6 years I've used a ""Laptop Lunch"" system, but now that my daughter is in Middle School with no locker access it's become necessary to pack as light as possible. She has to cross the entire campus a few times before lunch and carries a lot of materials making a Laptop Lunch impractical and likely ""less cool"".

I have a 10 y/o chihuahua and she really likes this. It is little tiny cubes of dog food mixed with rice. She has lost most of her teeth yet she is able to eat this easily. The cubes are easier to eat then the typical wet dog food that is in a can and then you have to mash up--she can grab onto the cubes easily.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that the pouches are designed in a way that makes some of the dog food stick to the bottom of the pouch. The bottom is concave so it is like a little pocket that traps food.<br /><br />But I would recommend this for anyone with a small dog who is getting up in years. Especially if you have a dog w/ dental problems or who has lost teeth.

"****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****",Very Bergamot-y Tea!,4

"I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.

It is refreshing, new, and something I would consider drinking again.  I leave off the final fifth star, as it was not the most flavorful beverage of the group, but I believe that owes to the fact that there are multiple flavors competing for a spot on your palatte.

"Having once lived in Japan for almost ten years, I'm a bit of a noodle freak. Ramen, soba, rice, glass, pasta, every kind of noodle is my friend. These noodles looked to be a promising candidate to join my circle of noodle friends. Unfortunately, these were a bit harder to get to know than most noodles.<br /><br />First of all, there is nothing on the package that tells you how to cook the noodles. There is an unhelpful (but critical) suggestion to soak the noodles in water for one minute (to soften them up), followed by two recipes. I'm assuming the recipes are a good way to enjoy the noodles (I didn't try them, however), but I just wanted to add them to some chicken soup I'd made. After soaking the noodles, I noticed that they had not gotten noticeably softer, and they were still quite bland. I decided to put them in a fry pan with some butter, and that did the trick. They softened up nicely as they absorbed the oil, and they were quite tasty after that. They were great in the soup, too. So with the preparation mystery solved, my second complaint is that the noodles are dry and very fragile coming out of the bag, and it was next to impossible to pull off a reasonable sized portion from the massive woven nest of noodles. Attempts at breaking them by hand ended with a flurry of noodle fragments all over the counter and floor (and probably the bottom of the bag of noodles, too). Same result with a knife. I suppose you could crush the bag before opening it to break up the noodles, but then where's the fun of the long, slender, slurpable noodle? I suffered through carefully pulling them apart and brushing the fragments into the pan to cook (and vacuuming the rest off the floor). But I say again, these were delicious noodles.<br /><br />So here's what you've got: very tasty noodles with great texture and flavor that require experimentation to figure out how to cook and that make a mess during preparation (unless you plan to eat the whole bag all at once). I'll sum them up as ""clumsily delicious"" and worth three and a half, okay four, stars.","Good texture and taste, hard to handle",4

"These treats truly are as pure as you can get -- 100% beef liver and nothing else.  This also means that they're grain free, which is fantastic for dogs with gas problems.

"Better Than Bouillon is a line of ""concentrated paste food bases"" that includes three vegan options: vegetable, beef, and chicken (or rather ""no beef"" and ""no chicken""). The ""not bouillon"" comes in small, 8 ounce jars and requires refrigeration after opening. You use the paste much the same way you'd use bouillon - there instructions for use on the jar - but according to the manufacturer, the paste is supposed to result in a ""richer and more natural flavor"" than one can get from bouillon cubes.<br /><br />I've bought a jar of each to sample, but thus far have only tried the chicken flavor (to make vegan chicken noodle soup - of course!). While the broth is indeed delicious, I can't say that I prefer it over the vegan bouillon cubes I normally use (namely, Edward & Sons and Rapunzel brand, though I'm still shopping around). Since it comes in a semi-liquid form, it's also messier and less convenient to use than a traditional bouillon. From an environmental perspective, the jars mean more packaging and greater use of resources in shipping.<br /><br />On the positive side, none of Better Than Bouillon's vegan options contain palm oil, whereas both Edward & Sons and Rapunzel do. So bonus points for that!<br /><br />Use it to make vegan soups, gravy, rice, seasoned veggies, pasta sauce - whatever your heart (or tummy) desires.

"My finicky cat LOVED these petite cuisines.  He would scarf them down.  The ingredients are wholesome, lots of juices and you could actually see the real tuna, mini shrimps and so forth.  The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because it is really expensive in the stores.  But if money is no object for your little 4 legged feline friends, then I highly recommend this cat food.",Great cat food but it is a little pricy,4
"As someone who was raised on Quaker oatmeal, I had the usual reservations about the product.  You know the list: bland, doesn't taste good, too runny, too thick.  But then, oatmeal tends to vary with preparation style.  That said, there was a bit of negative bias on my part going into trying the product.<br /><br />After eating a bowl of this product every day for a week (there's that much in the box, with a bit left over), I can honestly say that this product handily exceeded my low expectations.  Somehow, someway, the good people from Quaker actually found a way to make oatmeal consumption enjoyable, with just the right amount of additional ingredients to make it sweet, flavorful and filling.<br /><br />Specifically, the product works well with warm, hot or cold milk.  I tried the product a couple of times after pre-heating it in the microwave (high power for 15-20 seconds) and letting it sit for two to three minutes, and it was quite tasty, almost like having a bowl of actual oatmeal.  Like good, steel-cut Irish oatmeal, the product pairs well with a number of fruits, and I personally was very pleased with the combination of fresh blueberries and soft, ripe (but not overly-ripe) bananas that I added to it after I the let squares sit in warm milk for a few minutes.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it looks a lot like Nabisco's shredded wheat squares or General Mill's Cinnamon Toast Crunch (no small coincidence I suspect- a new competitive entrant, perhaps?).  It has a good texture and color, but I did notice that it took a bit of time for the squares to soften in milk (I personally do not like hard, crunchy cereal), especially if the milk is cold.  The product was sweet but not overly so, and a bit on the chewy side.  As an added plus, the product by itself is quite filling (and fosters good regularity.  That said, I do have one piece of strong advice (or perhaps a warning) for those like me who like to have their cup of French roast coffee with their cereal: expect to visit the bathroom shortly after having your meal and don't be too surprised if you feel magically five pounds lighter!<br /><br />Overall, I liked the product, and I think I will look for it in the stores.",A Worthwhile Purchase From The Quaker People,4
"My family can not eat regular gluten pasta and this was a good alternative.  Corn pastas seem to be a flavor and texture more like wheat pasta, so we prefer corn pasta to rice pasta.

"The Disposakup Lids are OK, they work as advertised.  I have no problems.  I suspect, but haven't tried it, that they could be reused if they are carefully rotationally indexed to the Kcup body (using an index mark).  However, one has to consider the cost of the lids themselves (including shipping), plus the cost of the premium coffee, plus the considerable trouble of peeling off the original foil, cleaning out the K-cup, refilling it, as opposed to just getting a bunch of Kcups at Sam's Club for $0.50 each, and tossing the carcasses.<br />However, I am still not sold on the whole Kuring thing.  I got it as a gift.",DisposaKup Lids are OK,4
"I love the taste of this tea, but I wish it came with the extra valerian.  That would be absolutely perfect.  But for now, this is my favorite tea.  It doesn't need any sweetener, thanks to the vanilla, and I don't like to sweeten tea before bed, because I don't want to have to brush my teeth a second time, and I like to get into bed and read with the tea.  This is the best tasting, most calming tea I have found, and I have tried hundreds of teas and even made my own from dried herbs.  Love this stuff.  Only wish the valerian was in here.","Delicious, but where's the extra?",4

"I bought this for my mom as a gift because she LOVES this flavor and has trouble finding it except during the holidays.  It is packaged in just a plain, cardboard box but I guess that's because this quantity is usually bought by restaurants.

"I absolutely love the flavor of the Kind bars, and this one is my favorite.  For people complaining about the fat.....NUTS HAVE FAT.  But that is the only source of fat in these bars.  Nuts are also full of vitamins and minerals..oh yes and PROTEIN.  These actually do taste like candy, and are a great pick me up snack.  If you want something filling though, and more of a meal replacement...go with Clif bars.  They can keep you going for quite awhile.  My real complaint with these?  The price.  No matter where you get them, they are on the high end.  I have 4 children and I cannot afford to keep these around as a regular staple.  Even buying directly, you have to get them in cases of 72..for over a 100 bucks.  Larabars if I am savvy I can get for about 1.00 a bar, and even though the texture is different (since they pretty much pulverize the nuts) are awesome and simple healthy organic, non GMO, gluten free, raw diet, vegan, most are lactose free variety's, and if the word peanut is not in the ingredients they were made in a non-peanut plant.  Kind can boast most of these too....larabars do take a couple extra steps.  they are also free-trade certified.....Oh and they have 19 flavors of their basic bars.",One of my favorite,4

"Tasty little bursts of energy. So much better than goo and other not so tasty products. Also, it's easy to eat one piece at a time throughout my run. Each package comes with a little adhesive strip so that you can reseal them.<br /><br />Can't be 100% on how effective they are yet, but so far so good.  I think when it comes to this sort of thing, you really should go to a store like REI and purchase a variety of brands and types to find what works for you.

"They have sugar and probably artificial whatever, they're not organic, blah blah blah. They're tasty and super convenient (I have them delivered to my office via subscribe and save; doesn't get much more convenient than that). That is what I was looking for, and that is what these are. They have big fruit pieces and crunchy nuts and... oaty oats. I think the apple is the best flavor, though the peach was pretty good and the berry quite acceptable (if a bit tart). Haven't tried the cherry because I don't like cherries.<br /><br />I do recommend using more water than to-the-line; I fill it to a good centimeter or so (it's kinda imprecise) above the line, and let it sit awhile to absorb.",These are pretty great,4

"I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?","The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)",4
"The coffee was great.  It's a wonderful variety of flavored coffees. If you're looking for regular coffee, you'll need to order that separate.

"Annie's GF Rice Pasta and Cheddar Mac & Cheese does not have the same flavor as what you ate before going gluten free so do not expect it to taste the same.  After you get over the fact that it does not taste like Kraft you can appreciate it for what it is, a nice way to have a quick meal.  It is not a main dish, more of a lunch.  I cook the noodles exactly in the range printed on the box (setting a timer). They always turn out al dente.  Then I add the powder and some coconut oil (as a butter replacement).  I stir that up and then add some milk, less than the package recommends because I like a sharper flavor.  I return it to low heat as I stir and combine the cheese powder with the milk.  It turns out smooth with a mild cheese flavor.  I divide the box in half for two adult servings.

So the pepper is not the star here, only about 50% of the product.  For what they are supposed to be, they are quite good.  Do not buy them expecting a lot of pepper--they are half breading.

"Marley Coffee is an interesting product which comes in a tasteful display box/dispenser, and proves that one can have fresh rich coffee just about anywhere without dedicated coffeemakers or pod machines.<br /><br />Maybe the ""One Love"" variety is meant for two cups per ""single serve"" bag, or perhaps one is supposed to do something more than to ""Stir It Up"" little darlin', as recommended on the box (in homage to the song.)<br /><br />There wasn't instruction on the packaging on how to get the brew right with these large ""tea bags"" of coffee. The only thing clearly marked was which side of the bag should be faced down in the cup.<br /><br />The coffee has a good taste, but the first bag I tried brewed up so strong it gave me the jitters. Good thing there are 15 individual plastic-sealed bags in the dispenser. My husband fiddled around with them because he likes an occasional cup of joe in the afternoon but doesn't want to brew up a whole pot.<br /><br />I credit him with coming up with the ""spoon test"" to figure out when the coffee was at the perfect strength. We use a 16 oz. cup because the circumference of the bag is rather wide for our 12 oz, and we pour boiling water over the bag which rises to the top as the cup fills. Then we wait for it to steep. After a couple of minutes, he takes a spoon and starts lowering it into the cup just until the bowl of the spoon is completely immersed. When the brew gets dark enough, the bowl of the spoon disappears except for the edges, and then it's done.<br /><br />It's a quality product, convenient, and can save on electricity, as well as not wasting coffee and good water, or adding pods to the landfill.

"I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea.

If you bury them in salt, or immerse them in chocolate, you are getting more flavor, but the trade off is unwanted cane sugar, and/or salt; so these make a pleasant bridge.<br />Extra added flavor with the thin coat of dark chocolate cocoa powder (that doesn't get on your fingers by the way), while only ingesting 25mg of sodium in a single 1/4 cup serving.<br />When I first started to eat them, I thought the dry unsweetened cocoa powder didn't add anything desirable to the flavor, but as I progressed to finishing about a 1/4 cups worth, I began to realize that this could very well become a strongly acquired taste.<br />If I had to be critical of the entire presentation, I would note that the plastic ""jar"" has a threaded top with 2 half circle single threads partially overlapping each other that results in a not so very snug closure. With very little effort you can snug them at closure and skip right past snug to loose again, so much so that if you dropped the container the lid may pop off, spilling the contents.<br />I am not commenting on the way they are sealed though, they did an outstanding job of that. You have to pop open the plastic seal over the top of the lid edge, just to remove the screw on top, and then once open, there is an internal air tight seal to keep the contents fresh, and they are. Overall highly recommended, especially if you are nuts about nuts.",Nuts About Nuts,4

Chocolate and mint is usually always good together. At first I thought this chocolate bar was a little too minty but the taste grew on me. This is a little different than those dinner mints we all love at restaurants. This bar is filled with tiny sugar crystals flavored with mint. So it is a little crunchy instead of smooth and creamy. The dark chocolate itself seems to be of a very high quality. So if you like dark chocolate and mint this is sure to be a winning combination.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,A Winning Combination,4

"My border collie came from the rescue with a lot of warnings about chewing, especially on soft things.  I now get a box of these rawhides delivered as a subscription, because they seem to do a good job of soothing her chewing fixation (along with plenty of exercise and attention and a few other fun toys).  It's nice to have a stack of them to reach into whenever I'm heading out the door and need to keep her busy.<br /><br />I chose these mainly because they don't have knots on the edges that can come off small in bits, and I throw them away when they get small.  I haven't had any problems with variations in the type or quality of the product with each order.  However, my dog has gotten an upset stomach when she's eaten quite a bit of them on an empty stomach (usually when she's waiting for breakfast).  I think this is something that happens with rawhide, and taking them away when there's going to be a longer-than-usual wait between meals seems to solve the problem.",Keeps my dog busy,4

The tea has a nice flavor that I usually do not locate in green teas.  It has as described earlier a smoky quality to it that gives your mouth a taste of the green tea that lasts but doesn't disturb.  I have enjoyed using this in my teapot and adding water through the day until I wear the leaves thin.  If you like green tea try this.  I enjoy it with honey and milk.",a great bang for the buck,4

"This Pho soup base is good if you don't have time to make soup from scratch. Very few restaurants actually make Pho soup from scratch. Most don't want you to know that they actually use one of the Korean or Japanese made beef dashida or Hondashi powder soup stocks and add a few ingredients such as star anise, clove, peppercorns and lemongrass. Pho is a good profit making dish. (Consider the fact that a pound of rice stick noodles cost less than a dollar.)The key to good Pho is having very fresh Thai Basil, Cilantro and Mung Bean Sprouts. If your going to add some sriracha, hoisin, chili sauce and lime to your Pho, you'll never know that this product wasn't made from scratch.

"I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)",Great Idea- My dog loves it.,4
"First, the packaging.  What exactly is a ""gold kili.""  I was hoping it would be some kind of mythical Asian flower or something interesting, but no.  My quick look-see around the Interweb revealed only that it's the name of this Singapore-based ongoing business concern, involved with Tasty® Singapore, which is an initiative of the government-sponsored International Enterprise Singapore, an effort to promote Singaporean food businesses worldwide (which has a very colorful and very loud website).  And Tasty has got a nice, smiley kind of logo, too (see image).<br /><br />If the good folks at Gold Kili want this and their other products to take off in the US, they really need to work on their packaging.  The copy on the envelope is not very good, a bit awkward, coming off as having been developed by someone whose first language is not English (like Singapore Chinese).  The instructions open with ""For hot serving...""  Well, I figure that has to do with heated water, but the 8th grader in me also instantly recognized a distinct yet seriously divergent possible type of serving method.  But I digress.  Knowing most Americans, the preparation text needs to be much more clear, with very concrete instructions, like starting with, ""Pour contents into a cup...""  Second, the only measure of how much water to use is in metric.  I'm down with the metric, yo, but most Americans are most definitely not, so you've got to actually tell them to put 8 ½ ounces into their coffee mug.<br /><br />Note that 8.5 ounces really isn't that much.  It's more or less a standard coffee cup, but in bigger-is-better America, that's only half a mug.  I recommend Gold Kili up-size their portions for the US market.<br /><br />Man, that ginger scent--strong--comes barreling right out right away when you open the envelope, and then when you stir it up, a very distinctive aroma.  The scent is quite good, a very nice alternative to coffee; brewing up a lot of this would be a very nice aroma throughout the house.  And so how did it taste?  Well, it was sweeter than I expected, which was a relief.  That unmistakable ginger taste is really strong, that pungent, stinging taste, spicy and quite insistent.  If you've had Asian ginger candy and can take it and like it, this product will work for you.  I do think that most Americans will not take to this, as it is a most definitely foreign and highly specialized ethnic taste, something they've only gotten the slightest hint of at their local bland Zap Wok restaurant.  The lemon flavor is there, albeit rather subtle.  You get the lemon mostly in the aftertaste.  You do get a very distinct and lingering ginger aftertaste of the drink, and that unmistakable low-level burn of ginger at the back of your throat.  It stays with you for some time, even after drinking or eating something else.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty good hot, but is NOT good cold.  For testing purposes, I added nothing to the drink, no sugar, nothing additional; I think doing so would ruin it.<br /><br />My experience with the drink's color was not what you see on the package, which appears to be a kind of semi-clear green tea.  It is very unclear if this is in fact some kind of tea.  All the envelope tells you is that it's ginger lemon drink, and that's all.  There's no more info on the packaging.  The actual color is a kind of ruddy brown, much like a tea.<br /><br />And hey, in the grandest tradition of Indians, Chinese and Malays (and generations of colonial descendants) living so peaceably together in lovely, sterile, boring yet successful Singapore, this product is in fact halal.  Yay.  There are no kosher markings.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you've spent time in Asia, and are up for something more than the ubiquitous, overpriced fare at Starbucks, this one will work for you as a morning drink.  For those not used to full-on ginger, this make take some adjustment.  The ginger taste is powerful, so is a good pick-up, although this product is caffeine-free.  It'll be a welcome product for Asians and those used to strong ginger products, but will take some getting used to for most Westerners.",One Mighty Powerful Ginger Punch,4

"I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: ""10 bars"" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars.

However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).",Decent taste - 5 servings per box,4

"I certainly respect another reviewer's opinion about the bones falling apart into ""a million pieces.""  However, I have ordered these bones about eight times and all-in-all, I am happy.  I gave it a four-star rating because I typically am very conservative when rating items.  My dog is a large Yellow Lab, about 100 pounds.  Ideally, these bones are a little too small for him, but they are a good deal.  I wish that they were a little bit bigger.  However, if you have a dog of approximately 35-70 pounds, then they might be fine.  My dog does eat them quickly (within ten minutes), but he seems to enjoy them.  There seems to be about 20 per bag, but I will have to check this more closely when I receive my next shipment.<br /><br />I am very aware of what I eat and what my dog eats.  So I was very careful when giving him the first bone.  I gave him one and waited a few days before giving him a second, just to see how he reacted.  Everything was fine, and continues to be fine.<br /><br />One thing that I don't like, but will probably not bother most people, is that they are packed in a very thick type of plastic bag; very durable, but it scares the heck out of me because I don't like plastic touching food, due to potential chemicals that can be released, especially during shipping when they might be subjected to very warm temperatures in planes or trucks.  So I take all of the bones out as soon as I receive them and put them in a big cardboard box that I am able to seal up.<br /><br />In summary, I am happy with these bones because my dog never reacted negatively or got sick and they seem to be of acceptable quality.  One final note, if you order the beef-flavored bones, which are dark brown in color, please note that when my dog starts getting them wet from his mouth, that they heavily stained my light tan carpet.

"I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!",Affordable Fun for your Dog!,4

"This was my first time with this brand. I tried it to get away from the high cost of other K cups. I bought french roast, west coast roast,and the Sumatra. The Sumatra is one of the best. really they are all good. The packing is a neat brown carton similar to what Quaker oats came in. using the Eco Java cup is easy it sits flat you tear open the packet and pour in then snap shut. brewing seems to take just a little longer but the coffee is hot and full flavored.",good choice if you think K cups are too costly,4

"""Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration"" is a very good shampoo/conditioner for those who suffer from dandruff and dry scalp. The product is very thick, and has a good fragrance that isn't overpowering. I suffer from dry scalp and mild dandruff. After using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for a couple of days, I haven't noticed any dandruff at all. If there is a negative, the price is a little higher than similar products that work just as well for me. With that being said, I give it 4 stars and recommend it.",Good Anti-Dandruff Hair Care,4
"We purchased the variety pack (strawberry, mixed berry, tropical, and sour apple) and overall are quite pleased with these. My daughter really enjoys the strawberry, berry and tropical flavors. However, no one likes the apple. It's not the sour factor (I love sour things), there's a weird bitter aftertaste in this particular flavor that's not appealing. I love how dense and chewy each rope is; they're surprisingly filling and are a very nice healthy alternative to the regular 'fruit' rolls on the market. We'll definitely be buying these again, although next time I'll buy each flavor separately to avoid the apple.",A nice alternative to sugary fruit rolls,4

"My family loves popcorn; the portioned packages work well.  the only suggestion that I would have is to cut the popcorn and seasoning part out first, place them in a measuring cup.  this will make it easier to pour in the pan for popping.  I spilled a significant amount of the seasoning and popcorn at first; and the fact that it's stored in plastic makes it not such a wise decision to place the plastic next to the hot pan.  of course put the butter in first, then add the popcorn and seasoning; less mess.<br /><br />just about every kernel pops.  very tasty!!!",Very good popcorn,4

"I've used these spikes for several years now on several dwarf apple trees. It's hard to tell how well they really work in contributing to the size and amount of apples, but I can say the trees that I used the spikes on have all produced really well. I'd recommend using them.<br /><br />The one caveat is that the spikes are somewhat brittle, and can split apart before you can really get them in the ground. It all depends on your hammering technique as well as how tough the ground is. Just take some care and some patience, and you'll succeed in getting most if not all of the spike into the earth.","great fertilizer spike, but needs a little care to get spikes in ground",4

"I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.",One of the best k cups we've tried so far!,4

"Trident Vitality Awaken (9 Count) chewing gun is a new product for those gum chewers looking for something refreshing and with a little bite.  ""Energy"" gum has been out for awhile (I've tried Jolt Gum around six years ago) with Rockstar coming out with their version a year ago.  But those gums are loaded with caffeine (enough as a cup a coffee) and the only thing they do is make your heart beat a little fast and are not very good when you're driving on long road trips (stick with plain old black coffee).  Trident's offering is a whole lot better tasting and I enjoyed the easy kick I received from it.<br /><br />The taste is very pleasant and the energy comes on gradually (not like a speeding bullet) and it doesn't give you a funny after taste either.  If you're looking for a bite of energy in the morning (and not one that will make you crash) then I recommend getting a pack of Trident Vitality along with a regular cup of black coffee.  What a way to start of your day!",A yummy chewing gum with a little kick.,4

"We got the Raw Boost Bites in chicken flavor.  Although my dogs will eat anything, they were especially excited about these treats.<br /><br />The quality of ingredients is excellent.  No grains--just freeze-dried meats, fruits and veggies, with some spices, and preserved with vitamin E.  They smell VERY chicken-y, moreso than conventional treats.  The freeze-drying gives these biscuits an odd texture, kind of like cardboard.  They hardly weigh anything.<br /><br />While the quality is good, there are a couple of negatives.  First is the cost.  My box only contained 18 treats.  I have two big dogs, so if I gave them each three cookies/day (not unusual), this box would last us... three days.  Second, while the size is fine for a larger dog, you'd have to break them for a smaller dog.  This makes a huge, crumbly mess.  Third, after eating one, both dogs do this weird smacking thing with their tongues for a full minute, as if part of the treat is stuck to the roof of their mouths.  I don't know if this is bothersome for them, but it drives me insane.<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this 4 stars based on the quality of ingredients, but I would not buy these because they're just not economical.  I don't want to spend $20+/week on dog treats (sorry, doggies!).","Good Quality, But Expensive",4

"After trying the Marley Coffee, I was pleased with its rich flavors of floral and berry.

"Let me just say 4 stars only because of the price, they are a bit pricy but finding Organic Peppers at a cheaper price is hard.  These are very fresh and provide a great flavor that you can immediately taste is better than what you would buy at the store.  Many people don't know what Tellicherry Peppercorns are so I thought I would share that in my review for those who might be wondering why they are worth more.<br /><br />Tellicherry whole black peppercorns are left on the vine longer so they develop a deep, rich flavor. Considered the finest pepper in the world.<br /><br />The berries for black peppercorns are picked from the vine just before they ripen and turn red. As they dry, the berries turn black. Left to ripen longer than most black peppercorns, Tellicherry pepper has a full, robust flavor described as almost fruity. Its mellow complexity makes it a wonderful all-purpose pepper in your kitchen.<br /><br />There is no better pepper for grinding fresh!<br /><br />I love the way these ar packaged in the plastic jar so you can keep them fresh!  I would recommend to everyone that you try these in your daily ""grind"" and you will be very happy with the robust flavor they provide.",Great Peppercorns for the Chef,4

"I ordered this dog food, unaware that our local supermarket sells it cheaper. I tried to cancel right away, but was informed that despite the fact that it hadn't shipped yet, I would not be allowed to cancel. Grandson and I learned that the cans at our Stater Brothers Supermarket are twice the size of these and way more inexpensive. However, the dogs love the Amazon Iams dog food, energetically cleaning their plates, licking every molecule off. It is good dog food, no doubt about that. It smells good and I'm assuming that means it is very good quality. I usually buy Amazon Prime Canadae Dry Dog Food, because it's excellent dog food, but needed to get wet dog food this time, because it disguises the taste of their prescription meds.

"This is a very good blend of spices and does give a good ""cajun"" flavoring to dishes, though not nearly as spicy as our family tends to like food.  A couple things to keep in mind:<br />1) The jars are not round, but square with rounded edges -- make sure they'll fit in your spice rack!<br />2) They aren't kidding when they say ""no salt"" ... you'll probably find your dishes don't quite taste the same if you're used to cajun seasoning that includes salt.  If you don't like the new (and healthier) flavor, you'll need to add some additional salt yourself.<br />3) Rating something's spiciness is hard as the comparisons tend to be rather personal, but we at least find this blend to be on the mild end (a slight kick, but definitely less than medium spicy).  Adding some additional paprika, chili, etc may be necessary (side note: try smoked paprika, it's excellent!)","Great flavor, relatively mild",4

This was my first try; I should have bought more because Amazon has about doubled the price in less than two weeks.  This is a medium blend and grind as advertised.  The top is tightly sealed; it was the hardest pull off top that I've ever encountered, and you could hear the air express as it was opened.  The aroma is great in the can, when brewing, and in the cup. The taste is, for me, somewhat artificial although not obnoxious, but it cost a star in my book.

They have this dry powder flavoring (I assume its a powdered sea salt base) which enhances the taste but doesn't stick to your hands. When we first tried them, they tasted familiar. That Friday we got Chinese food and realized -- they kind of taste like the wontons on a crab rangoon! Dry flat crunchy chip, not greasy, a little thicker. My husband has been eating them with sour cream & onion chip dip and he thinks they would be great with a thicker party dip.<br />I don't know if its because they are a bit thicker, but I find I can't eat as many. Awesome! I used to get lazy and sit down for a movie with the chips in the bag instead of a bowl -- and realize later that I had eaten the whole thing!

I'd love to taste the old formula, one reviewer claimed Zico was putting the original Brazilian coconut water back on the market, but that was back in September.

"I'm a tea drinker (can't stand coffee), so I was unsure about trying this tea after seeing the reviews about how well it replaces coffee.  It doesn't taste like any of my favorite teas.

For the shampoo: This smells really nice and my hair is shiny and soft. As for is it is helping me damaged scalp? I don't think anyone would really be able to tell.

"I got a trial packet of this low acid coffee throught the Amazon vine review program.  The packet contains 2.25oz of this low acid ground coffee (not sure if the retial package is 2.25oz or 3oz each).  I brew my coffee using a simple french coffee press.  This coffee tastes fine with plenty of real coffee aroma, not like the de-caf varieties.  There is some bitter after-taste though.  For me, if I drink a cup (12oz) of regular coffee in the morning and a can of coke (12oz) during lunch, I usually will have some degree of heart burn in the evening.  With this low acid coffee in the morning and a can of coke during lunch the heart burn has not happened so far.",Low acid coffee,4

"As far as I can tell, these dried shiitakes are just as good as other brands of dried shiitakes.  This product includes whole shiitake mushrooms of all sizes from very tiny ones to medium-sized ones to moderately large ones.  I didn't see too many colossal-sized shiitakes, the ones the Japanese would call, ""donko,"" which are separated from the rest and sold at a higher price in Japan.  Havista didn't explain what they mean by ""3-5 CM"" and how it differs from ""3-4 CM,"" which is slightly more expensive than ""3-5 CM.""  These dried shiitakes will fully occupy exactly 5 1/2 one-gallon plastic jars.  Product of China.<br />Caution:  Havista's dried shiitakes are extremely rich in vitamin D2.  Without even contacting Havista, I can tell that these shiitakes received plenty of sunshine where they were farmed.  I get hypercalciuria (calcium sand in my urine) after eating only two-thirds of the dried shiitakes in a 1-gallon plastic jar.  Hypercalciuria is a symptom of hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D overdose).",There's nothing seriously wrong with these dried shiitakes,4

"This granola is really quite good. In fact, it may be one of my favorite commercial granolas (sometimes I buy, sometimes I make my own) and it may be my new go-to brand when I do buy granola. It's rich and full of flavor and not overly sweet. The sweetness level is perfect (and the sugars weigh in at 6 g per serving, which isn't too shabby for granola - sometimes it can be loaded with sugar). The chocolate is dark and rich (my favorite kind) and the berries are a nice addition. So why not 5 stars? Well, the berries are my only gripe - there aren't enough of them! I snagged some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JLT66M"">Just Tomatoes Organic Just Strawberries, 1.2 Ounce  Pouch (Pack of 4)</a> to mix in and now it's perfect.

"Overall, I have been enjoying this drink. It's fruity and pleasant, with a honey taste that comes through pretty strongly. I like that it's decaf, so I can drink it any time of day. I like that it contains sucralose instead of aspartame.<br /><br />I have been using one packet in a large, 16-ounce glass, since each packet is technically two 8-ounce servings. The pink powder smells strawberry-ey at first (sorry -- I'm much better at book reviews than these food reviews!), and the color once mixed with water is a nice deep pink. The granules are big and take some stirring to dissolve, which the package does indicate.<br /><br />Amid the fruity and honey taste (and smell of honey) it's hard to detect any tea flavor. I picked up a little blueberry as I continued drinking it the first time. Could I tell that it contains green tea rather than black tea or any other kind of tea? Not at all.<br /><br />I like that it's low-calorie (though not technically sugar-free, since, as the ingredient list states, the honey granules contain sugar). But I've been avoiding sugar lately, so I'll take it!",Just fine as an anytime drink,4

"Nestea instant sugar-free with lemon is something I tried recently at a friends place who is not a coffee drinker and is dieting.<br /><br />It's not delicious and refreshing as it looks.

I would prefer to have no sugar at all than have aspartame in it.<br /><br />Occasionally I drink regular tea with lemon, but no sugar.<br />This is just my personal opinion, but when I'd read up on Aspartame being a possible carcinogenic, I never used it again until recently.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it's healthier to diabetics who want a somewhat sweet taste, but for myself, I don't like chemicals, only natural drinks and flavors.",Not  Like  Good  Old  Fashioned  Tea,4

Well how sweet it is... it not only accelerated the process but helped take some of the sting out of the experience. I did not apply directly into the wound at first....just around the edges.

Yes, they were a bit fragile if handled roughly--but the flavor was wonderful...a lot like a pecan sandie.

It was terrific to have something that tasted like a real cookie, versus the nasty storebought GF stuff out there!<br /><br />The secret to baking GF cookies is to mound the dough up at the center for reinforcement, and never short the baking time.

"The Chili Lime popchips are a bit overwhelming. My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal. However, I happily ate a whole bag just by itself, and it was fun.<br /><br />The chili (spicy) comes on strong at first, then you taste the lime, then it ends with a spicy limey aftertaste that is quite pleasant. This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs.

"I pretty much shop exclusively in the natural/organic food department in my grocery store and those few times that I have strayed and read labels I was always reminded why I don't shop in the normal part of the grocery store.  These bars are not bad at all.  So many others I have looked at have hidden artificial sweeteners (like aspartame) in them, but not these, only 8 grams of sugar per bar (our household limit is 9 grams per serving of any food) and there is a tiny bit of stevia, but I have no problem with that since I am a big stevia believer.  These have only 130 calories so it can be a snack (if a protein bar gets to be too high in calories it really ought to be a meal replacement) and these are chocolatey enough to satisfy my chocolate craving.  These have 3 grams of fiber, not so much, but then these are not trying to be fiber bars.  These bars have 9 grams of protein, not bad, but it appears to be all soy based, but since it is not SO much protein I guess that is fine (too much soy is not good).  There is some palm oil which I am not a fan of (not ecologically sound and it is cholesterol raising), but few processed foods out there are perfect.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a little something sweet and chocolatey that is low enough in calories to be a snack and who isn't so hung up on natural/organic foods.  From what I've seen in the conventional food isles these are quite clean and they taste good.

I can now put all that behind me and make sure I have an assortment of these convenient meals in the house for quick, convenient, but most importantly, tasty meals.<br /><br />The packaging is designed so that the pasta sauce and penne noodles stay separate until you mix them together.  I liked it just fine the way the noodles turned out after the 60 seconds, but if you want yours a little softer there are directions for how to do that.  This traditional marinara sauce has lovely chunks of tomato in it.  There are other ingredients also, but nothing overpowers so it all blends well together.  At 24% of daily dietary fiber this is a good source of fiber, but you might need to watch out for the 29% of sodium.<br /><br />This was really a tasty meal which would be good for both lunch or dinner.  I added a salad with mine and it was certainly an ample amount.  I like that it is 100% natural and I like that there are no preservatives added.  And the carton is even made from recycled paper.  So I enjoyed the taste, had an ample serving size (9 oz at 320 calories), and even put the outside cover in my recycle bin so it can be useful again.  Not bad!",I really liked this!,4

It's very hot and spicy, but for Rogan Josh other than made completely from scratch, this is our favorite.  Just have plenty of yogurt on hand.  We recently tried another Rogan Josh sauce in a jar, and it didn't compare.  We use a lot of Shan spice mixes as Indian spices themselves are hard to come by in our area, and we've never been disappointed.",Very tasty!,4
"I have begun buying Slim Jims in a large box to save money over individual purchase by the stick.  Part of my low carb diet.  They make a good between meal snack and the .28 ounce size works well.

"I'm a coffee drinker that prefers to grind my own beans because it is fresher that way. The more recently it was roasted the better. I like dark, hearty coffees, but not ones that have been over-roasted. A select few ground coffees can be good, and this is one of them. Melitta strikes a nice balance between the light and dark roasts. The dark roast predominates but the light roast helps make it smooth and flavorful. This is a fine grind and makes a more potent pot of coffee than similar amounts of your standard ground coffees like Foldgers or Maxwell House.<br /><br />They've priced this mid-range coffee competitively and I would recommend it to people who appreciate a flavorful, aromatic coffee. It cannot replace just roasted and freshly ground coffee, but you'd be hard pressed to find something much better outside of a gourmet shop. I've used Melitta's filters for years, and now I'm enjoying their coffees as well.

"This coffee smells a bit like Starbuck's Breakfast Blend, but it doesn't taste anywhere near as strong which, in my opinion, is preferred.  There isn't, however, any guidance whatsover on the box regarding preparation.  Thus, when I made my first mug of Marley Coffee, I wasn't sure how much water I was supposed to use or how much time I was supposed to wait, so I chucked in two packets and let them steep for two minutes.  The result tasted fine; not the best I'd ever had, but good enough for a sample run.  My second go with the coffee was a bit more involved, but met with better brewing results.  My household had run out of ground coffee, so I cut open several Marley packets to use in our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S4DI2S"">Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer With Thermo Carafe - Technivorm 9587</a>.

The tins are recyclable in most locations.

"GOOD POINTS:<br /> - great pricing (I got the Roland sale + subscription discounts)<br /> - well packed (heavy plastic bag inside thin metal ""paint can""-like tin<br /> - fresh & tender<br /><br />AMBIVALENT ISSUES:<br /> - the label says, ""baby ginger"", which I find hard to believe. First, the ginger has quite a lot of heat when eaten on its own. [It's now 1/2 hour after eating one slice with millky tea; my mouth still feels the heat and I am NOT sensitive to spice.] Second, about 20% is moderately to extremely fibrous. Third, the slices are medium to large, which would be alright if lengthwise, but one can see that they are crosswise (large rhizomes). None of these are qualities I associate with baby ginger. The reason I'm ""ambivalent"" is that while I think the label is incorrect, the Amazon product description does not include this, so it wasn't a factor in my purchase.<br /> - the sugar used is much coarser than usual (about 3-4x the size of US white sugar). The Australian and US candied ginger I've enjoyed in the past used extra fine sugar (US ""baking sugar""). My issue is that the coarser sugar doesn't cling and make a crust to protect the ginger, the way extra fine does. Also, about 1/3 of the pieces have unsightly clumps of sugar on them, which I remove before serving or using for baking.<br /><br />NEGATIVE:<br />- the fiber issue mentioned above is something I never encountered with Australian or US candied ginger. Unpleasant to eat and embarrassing for the hostess. Also slows down baking prep.<br />- the big crystals are mostly an esthetic issue, but there is the safety issue of one's blade catching on a crystal and the blade bouncing a little as the sugar shatters. Still trying to find a work-around for chopping and mincing.<br />- The ""paint can"" is difficult to work with. Obviously, I can remove some ginger and finesse the rest of the bag out of the can, to store as I like; but this is a 6 lb quantity packed in a resealable container: the container should be easy to re-seal and re-open. This container needs a tool to be opened; and each use renders the container harder to use--the thin metal dents and bents, so the lid is more and more misshapened. Actually, I'd prefer the packer please just seal the very sturdy plastic bag, label it for sale, and pass the savings on to the consumer.<br /><br />TO SUM UP:<br />A generally good product with great price point, but you have to invest considerable effort to get the best results. (Unless you don't mind a bunch of spiky slivers in your mouth, or your knife slipping again & again.)<br /><br />I love candied ginger as a snack, as a baking ingredient and as a ""food pharmaceutical"", so I'll be purchasing again. If this were a seasonal purchase (e.g., just for holiday baking), I'd pass and look for an easier-to-use product with more consistent quality.",great price point,4

"One of the difficult parts of dealing with Celiac disease is finding foods to safely eat while on the road.  In general salads are safe (except the croutons), but we have to watch the dressings carefully.  By bringing our own dressing my wife has found she can eat on the road and not get sick.  While the no calorie and fat free options are appealing, the Gluten Free aspect is wonderful for those who must eat Gluten Free. When you have Celiac, it's simple to tell if a food it simply labeled as Gluten Free or if it really is!  If it really is GF and also free of cross contamination, my wife doesn't get sick.  This dressing meets all her GF needs along with tasting good.<br /><br />This dressing has a nice consistency, tastes good and is about the right size to put on a Subway or Wendy's salad if you prefer your own dressing.  My wife takes this in her lunches too.  If you don't need the packets, you can save some money by buying a larger bottle and filling a small Tupperware type container to take with you.  You can also modify the portion size by pouring your own.<br /><br />In order of preference, our favorite Walden Farms flavors are:<br />Italian Salad Dressing<br />Ranch Salad Dressing<br />Chipotle Ranch Salad Dressing<br /><br />As a Calorie Free, Sugar Free, Gluten Free dressing this is the best ranch dressing we have found.  It's not as thick as Hidden Valley Farms and a little less sweet.  Hidden Valley isn't an option in our home due to our need to be GF.  If you don't mind some calories, a great GF Ranch Dressing is from Kens Steak House.  My kids prefer Kens Ranch to Walden Farms Ranch but they are not worried about calories or sugar at their age yet.<br /><br />It's amazing that these Walden Farms dressings can taste as good as they do with no calories, no sugar, no gluten, and even no fat!  Not all of the dressings taste great, but this flavor is really good.<br /><br />4 stars as one of my wife's favorite dressings.","Great Gluten Free option, portable and tasty",4

"I bought this starter-starter 16 months ago and forgot about it. I started the starter about eight months ago.  I followed the directions pretty faithfully.  It didn't seem really active and I never used it.  I've stored in in the refrigerator since then.  I try to feed it every two weeks but sometimes it stretches in to a month.  If it goes past two weeks, a lot of ""hooch"" collects on the top.  I just pour it off, throw away half of the mix and add 1/4 cup of flour, 2 oz. of filtered water, mix it up and let it stand covered overnight before returning it to  the refrigerator the next morning. It is obviously ""active"".<br />I actually started using it about four months ago, making Schlotzky buns; supplementing with a little yeast.  It works fine.<br />Then I used it in no-knead bread, again supplementing it with a little yeast. It made fine bread, but not sour, at all.<br />Finally, I went all in and made no-knead using the starter as the only leavening.  It made a wonderful loaf.  It is very  flavorful and truly ""sour"" tasting. It rivals the sourdoughs of SF and I lived there for 12 years.<br /><br />The recipe involves activating some starter over night, making the dough and letting it rise over night. Refrigerating it 1-3 days to autolyze, then making the loaf, letting it rise another 3 hours and finally bake.<br /><br />As you can see, this recipe requires really thinking ahead if you don't make it every day.<br /><br />For me, it wasn't a quick and easy path to authentic SF sourdough, but in the end it turned out to be just what I was hoping for.",High maintenance but pleasantly surprised,4

"I like good coffee and when I find it I stick with it.  Nonetheless, when a chance comes along to try something different, I'm willing to give it a try.  When I got the samples from Marley Coffee, my first reaction was the socially responsible credos listed on the box.  Nothing wrong with that but if the coffee isn't good, the good deeds don't matter to me.  After tasting it, I found that the coffee IS good.  The blend I received was ""Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe"" and it is very enjoyable.  The coffee is packaged in individually sealed coffee in their own filter packets.  Having an ample supply at home of other good coffee (and after enjoying a weekend of Marley Coffee) I decided that this was the coffee to take on the road.  I have been using motel coffee makers for years with the ground coffee I took with my wife and I.  We even bring our own measuring spoons and filters.  Alas, the motel coffee-makers have shrunk in size and I can't make a good job of making my own coffee.  These packets are just the right size for those dinky coffee-makers so I'm taking Marley Coffee on the road.  In fact, I did just that last weekend.  I even threw an extra packet in my coat pocket.  Good thing too because I had put the other packets in a different bag which left me with the local mediocrity.  Why the long story?

"I have been trying all brands of coconut water. I agree that the Vita Coco is perhaps the sweetest tasting coconut water. I bought the Naked Coconut water right when it became available (at a good price; keep an eye out as prices for several brands of coconut water has been fluctuating on Amazon). Anyway, Naked water is not as sweet as Vita Coco, yet not as sour as Zico. Naked water was certainly good enough to order more.<br /><br />I work outside in the Texas heat quite a bit. During this summer of 2010 (with temperatures above 100 degrees) I will work up a huge sweat, literally soaking my shirt. I found that drinking coconut water, of any brand, does wonders at refreshing me and giving me the energy I need to head back outside. Indeed, one memorable day I went inside to cool off; I was literally so tired that I thought I would not be able to go back out into that heat and finish my chores. However, after chugging down a container of cold coconut water and sitting for about ten minutes, I was amazed at how refreshed I felt. I was able to head back out and work up a new sweat. From that day on I have been a real fan of coconut water.<br /><br />I doubt the hype about being 'good for diabetes' and other health-related claims (I am diabetic and have found no difference in my blood sugar levels). However, coconut water does wonders at rehydrating the body: much better than Gatorade. Even Zico (which has been much maligned lately) does me great after a hot session in the heat.<br /><br />So, load up on coconut water. When you are overheated and thirsty, any brand will go down great. Keep an eye on the prices, since they seem to vary.",Very good coconut water,4

"Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.","Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!",4

"But healthier than most of the other snacks I cram into my mouth(and that's gotta be worth something right?).  They taste good too!  Kinda sweet, kinda salty.  They're made with sweet potatoes so it makes sense.

"In an ongoing effort to avoid diet soda during the day, I have turned more and more to liquid and powdered water enhancers.  They are often hit or miss in terms of taste, but I'm pleased to say that Lipton's ""Tea & Honey"" Strawberry Acai is a pretty solid product.  That said, be aware that this sweet drink tastes far more like a strawberry punch than it does tea.<br /><br />Obviously, for marketing purposes, Lipton is playing up the ""all-natural"" use of honey.  A quick glance at the ingredients, however, shows that while there is granulated honey on the list, there's also plain old sugar and, perhaps to add sweetness yet keep the calories down, the artificial sweetener Sucralose.  As a result, this is a very sweet-tasting drink.  It does, however, have a pleasant strawberry taste, and I'm primarily concerned about the taste.  One might argue, however, why a person should avoid diet soda if they are going to use a powdered mix that contains artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Another marketing ploy I noticed was that the ""5 calories per serving"" is actually two per packet, which cannot be resealed.  Essentially, you are supposed to pour the entire packet into a standard bottle of water and then, I guess, drink half (for a single serving).  I don't know anyone that would actually do this, so Lipton would be better off labeling this as ""10 calories per serving,"" which is far more accurate.  Lastly, the box warns that these drinks need to be shaken at length to dissolve the tea.  That's very true.  It took several minutes of solid shaking to make all those little tea granules disappear.  Don't shake and drink quickly unless you want grit in your mouth!<br /><br />These things aside, I did enjoy this sample and plan to use the entire box -- probably faster than anyone would recommend.  While not addictively delicious, it's more refreshing than bottled water and probably better for me than diet soda.  Give it a try!",Naturally (and artificially) refreshing,4

I keep a close eye on my pups while they eat these chews to ensure that they don't get caught in their throats. We have had one get caught in the roof of the mouth. I sometimes smash the points with a hammer just for my own peace of mind. The dogs love 'em.

"This looked like more of a woman's sort of product, so I gave it to the missus to try out. Here's what she had to say:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level. My doubt came from the low price and sort-of-cheap bottle design. I usually pay $10 to $20 for a bottle of shampoo from name brands such as Frederic Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Pureology and The Body Shop. I didn't think it fair to compare Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Moisturizing Dry Scalp shampoo with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear shampoo is comparable with some of the shampoos mentioned above. It has nice fragrance, cleans my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>. Although I won't say the quality of Clear shampoo is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear shampoo is great. The only thing I don't like is the bottle design. I don't like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle. I wish it had a nozzle dispenser or round shape so that it's easier to hold with wet hands. When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoo, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!",Great cost-performance,4
Of course the pumpkin tastes great but when I got my first order only 6 cans weren't severely dented/smashed.  Amazon was great and sent me a second order without question but there were 11 cans smashed in that one as well.

"This sauce is VERY HOT. There are typically two types of people buying hot sauce - someone looking for an alternative to tobasco or supermarket shelf hot sauce, and someone looking for a high end flavored hot sauce.<br /><br />If you are in the first category, be very careful. This is not the sauce you want to buy to try something hotter than tobasco, cholula, or other garden variety hot sauces. Dave's (and a bunch of other retailers on here) have a wide variety of hot sauces which are much hotter than tobasco, et al, but not in the same league as this. The roasted garlic or scotch bonnet from Dave's are an alternative - spicy, but not like this.<br /><br />If you are undeterred from my above comment, then here:<br />I like this sauce a lot. It is flavorful compared to other hot sauces in the same heat range (90000-250000 SU seems to be the range for this sauce). Using a cap or less in a pot of chili will make it hot enough that I'm sure the average person would have trouble handling it. You can use it a half-drop at a time as a flavor enhancer, and it will burn but still taste decent. I don't claim it tastes great, but it isn't like other super-high-end sauces. This sauce is approaching the top before you get into capsaicin extracts, though there are other, hotter products out there that are still considered sauces.<br /><br />To clarify, this has been tagged as an extract: it isn't. It contains extract, but it is a sauce, not a pepper extract.<br /><br />Good luck!","Great heat, but a distinction needs to be made...",4

"I like the Clear Scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back, without making my hair feel greasy as if I've left conditioner in it. I've used this for about a week now, and really like how it makes my hair look and feel. Definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me.<br /><br />I used to have to worry about greasy, oily hair back in the day. I searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily. Well a handful of years ago I started to go grey, and when I went grey, I skipped right over the ""salt & pepper"" look and jumped from a dark brown to Bob Barker in what seemed almost overnight.<br /><br />Now, I didn't mind losing my hair color at a young age...at least I still had a full head of hair which is more than I can say for several friends, but what I hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair. It was coarse, dry and wiry. Suddenly shampoos like Head and Shoulders and Pert we too harsh, and my scalp felt brittle.",great product,4

"When looking for low carb items I found Swiss Miss Diet hot cocoa.  When I have a sweet tooth craving or the need to eat when I'm not hungry,I have found this to be a good alternative.  When I drink it, it satisfies my sweet tooth and because it is a hot liquid, it makes me feel full without adding to my waistline.<br /><br />That being said, I will tell you when I made it with just hot water, ugh. Not very tasty.  I have discovered that if replace 25-50% of the hot water with half & half, creamer or milk it make a HUGE difference.  For an extra special treat, I add whipped cream on top!  =)  This is probably not a good choice for those NOT on a low carb diet since the addition of milk and whipped cream will add fat and calories.<br /><br />For a spin on plain hot cocoa, try mixing it with coffee for a low carb mocha without spending a fortune.",good low carb choice,4

In areas that get rain (or watered) then smell goes away quickly, but it still seems effective.

After his recent difficulties with a teeth cleaning at the vet, I resolved not to have him go through that again, so it is a good thing to have the extra dental shield ingredient that protects teeth from tartar build up. There are also a lot of vitamins in the biscuits. The recommended feeding is 2 biscuits twice a day, which I think is way too much. This would be too filling and cause the dog to not eat enough of its dog food. If 4 biscuits per day are needed in order for the dental benefits to be realized, that is not good. Overall, I would use these biscuits several times a week to possibly give the dental benefits, but not as often as recommended.  :)",Our dog is crazy about these,4
well it's a fave thing for my bf.. but i guess its a lil too small for a big KID like him..<br />ITS A GOOD BUY THOUGH!,Realized its Small,4

"My dog likes these very much,and I am glad I purchased them.  I shared them with a friend who has a puppy, and her puppy likes them, too.  I think they are healthy for my dog.  I do recommend them for a treat for anyone's dog.",Newman's Own Dog Treats,4

"The other reviews are correct in the fact that the ""suggested"" retail price is $4.99 per bottle.  Some sellers are ripping the consumers off by pricing them higher.  As always... caveat emptor!<br /><br />The Ginger Ale syrup is very good in my opinion.  It is very close to Canada Dry's Ginger Ale in crispness and tartness.<br /><br />I use the ""three buzz"" carbonation method and then fill the syrup cap to the line in the cap about a 1/2"" from the top of the filler.  This creates the perfect syrup to carbonation ratio and makes a very drinkable and tasty ginger ale!",Ginger Ale Flavor is quite tasty!,4
Good product. And best quality,Delightful,4
"This pineapple Zuko is instant--it dissolves easily and is very convenient to use when making a soft drink for the family or to use as a mixer. Mixed with coconut rum, it's divine! LOL It is also good mixed with orange juice and coconut water...it's a little bit artificial tasting, but not overly in my opinion...it's like drinking the light syrup out of a can of pineapple. It's an awesome buy in my humble opinion because each ""bag"" makes a LOT of Zuko. I keep this in the pantry and sometimes mix it with the Jama flavor (hisbiscus flower flavor, and excellent!) and serve it over crushed ice. It's awesome. It's also shelf-stable. If you keep some in your pantry, you'll always have something good to drink (or mix with your spirits.)",Convenient and a great mixer!!!,4

"I am so happy to find that I can order these any time of the year...not only around holiday time. They are just the tiniest bit dry...but I am very pleased. The quality is consistent. I eat them right out of the bag. I have not used them for cooking, but I imagine that they adapt very well to any recipe. I LOVE them!!!! In fact, I am going to the kitchen right now to open a bag for my afternoon snack. They are very comforting. Don't know what I would do without them!!!!!",Chestnuts any time of the year. Yea!!!,4
Ok,Pretty good,4
"The Black Bean soup is very good and even better the next day. The Split Pea was also quite good. The Vegan Curry is not really a soup but a nice rice dish. They are very easy to make but I recomend heating them longer than the directions recomend and instead of the suggested 8 minutes steeping time you wait a bit longer for the beans to soften.<br />It is a good instant soup but if you reheat it the next day it's a great instant soup that is actually quite filling. The price is fair and delivery was quick. I would recomend this product to lazy people who like good soup, like me.<br /><br />I will buy this product again.<br />Dean",A good instant soup,4

"I saw all the problems people were having with damaged cans but the sale price was too good to pass up.  I ordered two cases.  First case, not even a little dent.  Second case, bashed to heck.  Obviously not Amazon's fault since the boxes they arrived in were fine.  Farmer's Market really needs to figure out what is going on in their packing department!",Darn those dented cans!,4

"Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.","Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!",4
"I have to admit I did not actually taste these pops (you'll have to trust the other reviews on the flavor), but I included these in my 5-year-old son's party favor bags along with 4 other items, and they were the first items the kids pulled out. All of the kids seemed really delighted by them (which was the point), as they are not your average tootsie-pop or ""ordinary"" lolly pop. I noted, however, that they are quite difficult for preschoolers/kindergardeners to open, as they are excessively sealed, but once the wrappers were forcibly removed, the kids really enjoyed them.","Adorable, cheerful party favors",4
"Both my cats love these treats and eagerly gobble them up -- the problem is that the cats eat so quickly that they don't actually chew the treats!  The treats are smaller than their kibble, which is a large triangle/pyramid shape of food, thus they are quite easy to swallow with little or no chewing.  Since the chewing and crunching is necessary, the cats aren't really benefiting from the dental effects.  But they do love the taste, so I'm happy to give this 4 stars.",cats love it so much they don't crunch it!,4
Product is good ...but it's air flow is not 45ft. as it says it's only 20-25ft. Not cooling room that much but one good thing that for one person it is best & you can install it in room as it does not cause humidity . Overall good product,Worth the money,4

"These packets are easy to use.  Loved that.  Used them at a fundraising event.  However, I had no way to gauge how many servings each packet makes.

"First of all, I was worried about the pulp that is present in this product.  But it's not like orange juice pulp.  The little bits of aloe are actually quite juicy.  As someone who does NOT like to have floaties in anything I drink, this pulp was quite tolerable.<br /><br />The flavor was very interesting.  It wasn't very sweet, and the reason for that is obvious.  There is no added sugar.  The only sugar present is the stuff that naturally occurs in the mango, mangosteen, coconut, and aloe.  The result was actually quite refreshing.  But I will warn that it was very coconutty.  I could barely taste the mangosteen and mango.  It was almost like a pi&ntilde;a colada.  Coconut is a flavor I absolutely love, so I had no problem with this at all.<br /><br />The one warning I have is what aloe can do to a person's digestive system if that person is not used to aloe.  I highly recommend starting off with about a quarter of a bottle a day and work your way up.  I drink this before I spend any time where I need to keep hydrated because the high potassium content helps the body retain water.  But overdoing it can lead to diarrhea, and that would conter-act the hydrating qualities.<br /><br />I'm editing after drinking a few bottles to give an updated impression.<br /><br />First of all, I've started having to strain the pulp out of the juice.  This isn'ta big deal, but after a couple of glasses, I started to develop a gag reflex due to the pulp.  It's not specific to this drink.  I do the same when I drink pulpy orange juice.  I do, however, have to drop one star because of this.  If it was pulp free, it would get the full five stars.<br /><br />Another thing I've noticed is that this tastes almost identical to all of the other Coco drinks made my Alo, so which one I buy in the future will be determined mostly by which one is the cheapest.<br /><br />And of course, the final thing I'd like to point out is that this stuff has some pretty amazing hydration qualities.  If I drink a half a bottle before excercising, the water I drink while excercising goes a lot further towards quenching my thirst.  The reason, of course, is because it contains such a large amount of potassium.  Potassium is an electrolyte, and electrolytes are needed in order for the body to absorb water that is ingested.  I used to get full on water while spending four hours in the 100 degree heat on the golf course, but a quick potassium pick-me-up before the round helps me to regulate the amount of water I need to drink while outside in that heat.  For that reason alone, the fact that it is a great natural alternative to Gatorade, I will be continuing to buy this product.",Very interesting,4
Very nice ðð,Value-for-money,4
"I found that the Pop Tarts crumble a lot more when I get them shipped.  It's fine if you use a toaster oven. It's a bit of a pain if you constantly have corners break off and burn in a stand-up toaster.  The case price is good, and I love the convenience of having a cheap breakfast food that my family loves on hand.  I don't really get why the best flavors, like apple strudel and cinnamon roll, cost more per case.  They're all the same price at local stores.",Crumbling Pop Tarts after shipping,4

"Like other reviewers have said, these are a little salty, but if you have your snack with a drink, the saltiness isn't so bothersome.  Otherwise, they have an AMAZING flavor and provide a satisfying crunch.  Also, it's a good source of calcium if don't drink milk.","Delicious, but a little salty",4
Although stronger than what we're used to using. It's still very good and can be blended to taste for limeade and Margaritas pretty well.

"This is one of the first food items I found after being diagnosed with Celiac disease over 1 1/2 years ago.  It tastes great.  I have it as a breakfast bar, snack, dessert, and it's only only 110 calories (something I now have to watch due to weight gain).  Chocolate & Berry flavors are equally as good (if not better).  I typically buy these in bulk from Amazon; the price is comparable to what local retail stores are selling it for (i.e. Wegmans, Whole Foods, etc.).",Great Gluten-free Snack,4

"My kids love these ""squeezy pouches"", and I was willing to give them a try because they were a decent price, organic, a brand I like, etc.  We haven't tried any others, and I'm not sure I'm inclined to.  The ingredient list doesn't make it clear how much of what's in there is apples vs. berries, etc. of course, but if the price of this flavor is similar to that of other flavors, I'm not surprised if they're mostly apples with a bit of flavoring from other fruits.  I use them to freeze and leave in the cooler when we go out, for a treat later so the kids don't beg for ice cream.  And regarding these types of pouches in general, though they are handy, lightweight, and easy to use, they are also not recyclable, which I very much don't love.  It's a trade-off I guess.","Kids like it, not sure it's worth it",4

"I cannot drink green tea, for some reason it doesn't agree with my stomach and that bummed me out because I like the health benefits. After reading up on White Tea, I decided to try this brand, and I am not disappointed! I like this tea and will stick with this brand for as long as I can get it! I like the taste, it goes down smooth! Just follow the directions and you will be fine! I also love that I will still get all of the health benefits and it's easy on my stomach!

"These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again.",Good chips with an occasional bad aftertaste,4
"I wanted a food for a a dog with skin problems. His skin greatly improved with the switch, though he still itches some.  He loves the food. No recalls, American made with American ingredients was a big plus (no Chinese poisoned food).  I took off a point for availability, which increases the price. Fortunately he is a small dog and the food lasts a while.  He has done well so now feeling safe to expand the diet to other flavones in this line for variety.",Great food!,4

"If you are a fan of vanilla, which I am, this is a fine tasting coffee with a nice overlay of flavor to the usual Starbucks roast. The grounds have a rich, nutty aroma and it brew up nicely. My only issue is that even with its fancy name, it still tastes like an added flavor and not ""infused"" with the beans themselves. To me, it tastes very similar to products from other big American brands -- suitable for most general purposes but for a truly exceptional cup of coffee you'll have to pony up a little more.","""Natural Infusions""...kind of.",4

"The jury's still out on whether or not the baby likes it.  She is an EBF baby.  However, my only reason for taking off a star is - why is this formula so sweet?  It tastes like a milkshake!  I feel like I'm training the baby's taste buds to prefer super sweet foods and I don't want to put her on a road for future obesity!!!  The other formulas are not this sweet and therefore, I almost feel like I have to mix it with another brand that isn't quite so cloying.  Does this have the same amount of sugar (rice syrup or not, sugar is sugar!) as the other brands?",Love that it's organic but why so sweet?,4

"Love the taste, but a 'squeeze' is hard to measure. A quick squeeze, a full squeeze, a short squeeze, a long squeeze?<br /><br />I bought MiO to flavor the occasional water bottle while hiking. I'm glad I tried it at home first. The directions state one 'squeeze' ( ½ teaspoon) per 8 oz. Even if you can perfect your ½ teaspoon squeeze (or carry a ½ teaspoon with you), another size glass or bottle adds difficulty. I use the little-squeeze-then-taste method, adding more little squeezes and sips until I have the perfect taste. I sure would prefer a less trial-and-error approach, but this method works for any quantity of water where the pre-measured powder packets don't.<br /><br />Once you perfect the amount of MiO to add to your water, it does taste great. I actually like having the water colored so I know which water bottle is flavored and which isn't.<br /><br />The label recommends use within one month of opening, which may be a few too many servings (24) of one flavor for an individual, but great for sharing with family or others. For my hiking and other more solitary uses, I'll go with the longer shelf life of individual serving powdered mixes for variety.",Great taste - difficult to measure,4

"You know, I was sceptical initially.  I am a coffee afficiando - I'm part Cuban for Godsakes.  My wife has been using these k-cups for about two years or so, and I've always turned my nose up at her quick cups.  But I've been too snobby.  I tried one the other day - I had my usual ground and pressed large cup in the morning, and was looking for another smaller cup in the early afternoon.  I didn't feel like pulling out the burr grinder, french press, and boiling the water.  So I poppped a cup in when the wife was out in the garden and tried a cup.  Whatta ya know - not so bad at all.

"These wonderful fruits are of a consistency somewhere between apple sauce and baby food.

Since these include only fruit, juice, and natural flavorings, they make a nice snack without added sugar.<br /><br />However, having recently made an extended trip by myself, I discovered they are wonderful in a different way. They make a great boost for the driver as well. And they aren't half bad, even when warm! I am a diabetic, so the 15 grams of carb are a perfect complement to my needs for a snack.

He never knows exactly where the treat went and sometimes I sneak one in while he's not looking, so later he will catch scent of it and retrieve it. It's very entertaining for both of us and I will definitely buy more dog puzzles in the future.",My dog seems to like this puzzle,4
"A trick I learned while living in Europe is that if you combine saccharine (which is what Necta Sweet is) with Equal or some other similar sweetener, the taste is a lot better than either one by itself.  The Germans sold sweeteners that were a combination, and they were remarkably better than what we had here.  You can get the same effect by combining a packet of equal with one of these tablets.  RJB.",Combine this with Equal and it is very tasty,4

"At first I tried this coffee with boiling water and a little milk.  Unfortunately, the beverage seemed flat tasting, kind of sweet with good spice, but definitely missing something.  I tried other instant coffees before, and some are actually pretty full bodied, tasty versions (like Starbucks Via or Trader Joe's instant).  Once I tried this coffee with hot milk, however, this International Coffee was very flavorful, full bodied and perfectly sweet, almost as good as a Dunkin Donuts pumpkin spice hot coffee.  The only drawback to this tasty drink is the sugar content (about 24 grams per serving), but as an occasional drink or substitute for a candy bar, this sweet little beverage is a nice break from the norm.  I would just recommend heating up some milk instead of boiling water, or at least mixing the two in an even ratio.","Mediocre with water, good with milk",4
"Where was this before I turned 21? Oh, popular in Europe. You buy your juice (64 oz. juice with 20+ grams of sugar, filtered, no artificial sweeteners), add a packet (you get 6 packs), attach the included airlock (I used vodka instead of water to prevent insects) and wait at least two days. I waited longer to try to get to the 14% alcohol limit it says it can get. It tastes like a lightly carbonated juice, think champagne. They recommend using grape, cranberry and/or pomegranate. I don't if it would or would not work with orange juice, but it would taste like a mimosa if it did. I would and have recommended this, for the novelty of it alone. It was nice that it came with an airlock, if you want more Amazon sells them, or you can make your own like I did. It really tastes pretty good and it was so easy you couldn't over complicate this/screw up if you tried.","Quick, fun, easy and cheap.",4
"Though I have been satisfied with this company's shampoo and conditioners, my small delve into the rest of the hair products hasn't left me nearly as impressed.  The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a> left my hair feeling oily and limp no matter how little was used.  However, this balm is a much better way to go when it comes to dealing with with a dry scalp.  The balm smells wonderful, and a little goes a long way... but even the mistake of too much didn't leave my roots looking greasy.  I find this best to use right after the shower... I massage a small amoung into my scalp, then blow-dry. My scalp feels great, my hair looks good.  I also ran a tiny bit over my hair before straightening, and was pleased with the results.  Very  nice scalp treatment.",Great scalp treatment.,4
"At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  ""real""beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.",Worthwhile treats,4
My girls loved the taste of these Oatmeal Rasin Chewy bars.  They are great for a small snack for school.  The only problem is that they fall apart way to easy.

But I still gave them a 4 star rating for the flavor.,Very tasty but fall apart too easy.,4

When I tasted it for the first time, the taste of zico was weird; it tastes like plastic mixed with coconut water- but it does not actually have any plastic. It is just that the coconut water has a different taste. It is not sweet and tastes very bland. But after trying out 12 bottles, I found my older brand to be very sweet. My husband likes Zico better so I guess I am going to alternate the subscription between Zico and the other brand.",Very different taste,4

I didn't add the seasoning because the venison sausage has tons of spice to it.<br /><br />We all dug in. We all loved it. When I told him that it was from Velveeta, his response was ""I thought the cheese tasted different.""

These are great - they work well with peanut butter or flavored cream cheese for a sweet treat or with tuna or egg salad as well.  I have them in place of toast since I am on low carbs and they are great with eggs in the morning.  Serving size is two but I usually only need one so the carb count is only 5.5 that way. (11 for 2 pieces)  They are a little dry to eat plain but I have buttered them and eaten them plain as well and that works too.  I haven't tried it yet but I think they would work broken into a salad as croutons too.<br /><br />The only downfall I found is the packaging.  Once opened you can't close it so I slide the opened package into a ziplock bag (gallon size) and they stay perfectly fresh.,Fabulous!,4
"I was going to visit a friend in a foreign country where fruity tea is a rarity, and since she specifically requested this particular brand and flavor, I started the search in my neighborhood grocery stores. From the very high end to the mom and pop shop, I couldn't find this particular flavor, that's when I turned to Amazon.<br /><br />Fortunately, it is available through a seller store but I was shocked to find that the shipping and handling cost almost as much as the price of the product. In other words, for the price for 3 boxes of tea, you only get 2. But since this is the only place I can find it, I paid the price. My only consolation is that my friend's happiness is priceless.<br /><br />To give the seller the benefit of the doubt, I think the effort was to keep the fragile paper box intact as it arrives. But my friend didn't care for the box, she even suggested that I ""discard the box and put the tea bags in a ziplock bag"" for easier fit in the suitcase.<br /><br />If I may suggest that the store offer different types of packaging options, such as the highest priced and most sturdy package, or less sturdy (a plastic wrap to prevent the product gets wet in the process of shipping, in a large bubble envelop, for example) but more reasonable price, it would be great.","Thank you for carrying this product, but...",4

"PROS:<br />Sour (In fact, the first thing people tell me when they eat these is just that). Not too sour, just right.<br />Flavorful! Biting into the orange half of the Orange/Blue Raspberry worm is like having someone smash an orange into my mouth. In a good way.<br />They smell great, in fact, they filled up the entire room with fruity goodness when I opened the bag.<br />9 pounds is a lot of worms, although the size of the box fooled me.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Can melt. I made the mistake of ordering these at the end of June. BIIIIG mistake. While in the shade of the UPS truck, the southern blaze fused them together. Good news though, this does not affect the great taste at all beyond how you now have an amorphous blob of fruity fusion. Good stuff.<br />The abundant smell can make it hard to hide the worms from pesky siblings :S<br />With only 3 kinds of worms (Green Apple/Lemon, Cherry/Lemon, and Orange/Blue Raspberry), things get boring after a while.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />""2 months is the most common subscription period"" People, really?

"When I opened the pouch and sniffed I was very pleased because it smelled spicy, but also richly creamy-pumpkin. But you often can't tell what something is going to taste like from its dry smell, and that seems to be the case here. For this first tasting I prepared the matcha with just hot water (then added a little sugar later). I got almost no froth when whisking this one, which has to be an effect of the flavoring somehow. It smelled very clovey when prepared, that really is the dominant aroma.<br /><br />The flavor of the matcha when prepared straight is pretty subtle, but improved when sugar is added. When is really shines, however, is in latte form.  The thing about pumpkin pie is that it's creamy and sweet, so adding more creamy and sweet elements really brings out the pumpkin pie flavor.

I love soft chewy candy and decided to buy some bulk on Amazon. I had never heard of Albanese but after reading some reviews I decided to give them a shot. Let me first say that 9 pounds of sour worms is a lot! These worms are very good. They are pretty big and the sour taste is not over powering. The fruit flavors are all tasty but there are only 3 different flavor combnations and after a half a bag I got kind of tired of the flavors and they weren't as enjoyable. If you don't eat them too fast like I did though they are very good. If I could do it again I would buy a 4.5 pound bag of this and 4.5 bag of something else for more of a variety. Would definately reccomend if you need bulk candy for a party or something like that.,I liked them,4
"These are delicious, especially for something that is sugar-free.  They are light, with a nutty, chocolatey taste.  I thought there was a light toffee flavor; if you're looking for more toffee, this is not the way to go.  I was surprised they were creamy inside, but this did nothing to detract from the flavor.  My only complaint is that I typically want more (they are rather small), so perhaps not the best choice for weight loss.  :/  I'd go with something that has more volume for 100 calories.",Yummy,4
"The flavor is strong curry with a bit of spicy hot. I decided to try the Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce with venison instead of beef. We primarily eat venison and elk so I felt this would be a better test for us. Following the very simple directions,I started by cutting the roast into thin strips and some chunks, nothing bigger than a silver dollar. I then stir fried the venison in oil in a steel wok until done since my wife does not care for any pink in her meat. The recipe calls for frying the meat in a pan until half done. As I finished the meat I put in the 4/5 cup of water into a pan and added the two sauce packets. One held a solid and liquid while the other a white power. (no MSG) A french whip was required to mix the white power into the water. A semi-soft material that looked like very small pieces of green corn husk were present in the sauce. I am not at all familiar with food from Singapore and have no idea what this was. My wife and I both remarked that this was the only thing we didn't like about the sauce, but it was not bad just unusual for us. When the sauce came to a boil I added the venison and let it cook as I prepared the rice and a salad. We both found the dish very tasty, my wife found it to be almost at the limit for her in ""hot"" taste. We had the leftovers  the next day, I found it even more delicious. She found it hotter. We both decided that we would buy it again since it was a big change of pace for our usual venison dishes. It was very easy to make and was good with rice though I would like it with noodles as well.

I wanted a good, healthy, high protein, low glycemic, etc. meal replacement/ snack bar to eat on the go that I can keep on hand to help me reduce my caloric/ fat intake and stop me from eating unhealthy, fatty foods so I can shed a few pounds.  I went to Whole Foods and asked the employee working in the health bar area and she told me that this brand was a favorite for high protein, no sugar, and pretty good tasting.  She also told me that Chunky Peanut Butter and White Chocolate Chip were the favorite flavors.  I bought them both and liked them and saw that Amazon has them cheaper so I bought a box of each.  I was concerned when I read the reviews on here and someone said the bars were stale/ old/ not fresh, so I was prepared to send them back if need be.

That means that there is no fat and very few calories, but they are still satisfyingly crunchy, making them a fantastic ""got the munchies"" snack.

"When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!",A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...,4

"I can't tell you it taste like coffee, not even sure it taste like pumpkin spice, but I really like it.<br />It's foamy, flavorful and thick.<br />You can drink it just with water, or add milk - and you'll still enjoy.<br />It's 60 calories per serving, assuming 1 1/3 tablespoons of the powder, I actually put 2 full teaspoons and it tastes great.<br />I was a bit surprise to find out it has 13% fat!! - so take that into consideration.<br /><br />All in all, tasty!",Fun drink for a cold day,4

"Let's face it - ""Folgers"" isn't a name that usually springs to mind when you think of great coffee, but this isn't bad.  Nice aroma, a balanced blend that's not too strong, but still provides plenty of flavor.  Give it a try if you're tired of overpriced K-Cups that cost almost what a coffee shop would charge.  Mrs. Olsen would approve.<br /><br />UPDATE: my review was based on a purchase price that figured out to 46.5 cents per cup.  They were worth trying at that price.  The current price of 65 cents a cup puts them in the same price-range as gourmet brands like Green Mountain or Coffee People, and they're not even close to the same quality as those brands.  If you can find them for under fifty cents a cup, they're worth trying.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.",Surprisingly tasty coffee at a nice price,4

My cat doesn't have a good sense of smell, and the first time he ate the doctored food he looked a little surprised, but he eats it without a fuss.

After some looking around I found people put it in the fridge and then have it as iced coffee.<br /><br />This is genius. The coconut flavor really pops when the coffee is cold, and it doesn't taste watery.

"Amazon sent me six the Stila blueberry package with six bars, so I gave them to six people, of varying ages to sample.  Kids of all ages LOVE the bars.  They thought the bars tasted like cookies rather than something with 0g Trans Fat and only 100 calories per bar.  Adults also liked the bar.  Some preferred the softer granola bars to this type of snack bar, but that is completely personal taste.  I also really enjoyed the taste of the bar.<br /><br />My only complaints, though, are as follows: 1) Thee may only be 100 calories in each bar, but each bar still has 15 grams of fat; 2) the bars contain high fuctose corn syrup; and 3) the bars crumpled a lot when broken into pieces so very small children have a tendency to create many crumbs while eating the bar.<br /><br />Overall, though, I think it is a great snack to keep in a kids' school bag, diaper bag, gym bag, or brief case as it has few calories and tastes great.",Kids & Adult LOVE It But a Few Changes Would Make It Even Better,4

"I bought these after reading some of the other reviews. In fact, i have since decided to add it as a subscription purchase. I dont think it warrants five stars, but certainly good enough for four. Why? Well, first, i'll start by saying that it really does taste good. That is definitely as advertised. The reason i knock one star off is because while it does give me a bit of extra energy, i have noticed that for me at least, it wears off in more like two or three hours rather than five or more. So, it is a good product, and definitely well worth the asking price, but not amazing. I like it, but i dont love it, and so four stars fits the bill perfectly for me.<br /><br />p.s.

"My name is Annelies and I work for attune foods, the manufacturer of Erewhon Cocoa Crispy Brown Rice cereal. Our Erewhon certified gluten free cereals are made in a peanut-free, tree-nut free and dairy-free facility. They are run on a shared line with gluten and we abide by good manufacturing practices to help ensure against cross-contamination. This consists of the machinery being sanitized and thoroughly washed down before the cereal is made. Then after it is made, the cereal is tested to ensure it is less than 20 ppm of gluten. We sent the cereal to a separate facility last fall to double check the levels at which it tested and found it to be less than 5ppm of gluten. In November of 2010, our Erewhon gluten free cereals were certified gluten free by GIG.

"ORIGINAL REVIEW: 1/5 stars<br /><br />First off, I would like to say that these chips are very tasty and the ingredients don't intimidate.<br /><br />The problem with this item is that it is stated that there are 24 - 24 oz bags of chips. There are actually 24 - 1 oz bags of chips. HUGE difference 24X24 not equal to 24X1!<br /><br />I am very disappointed in amazon for allowing such a discrepancy in this listing.

The seller I bought from, Stronger Nutrition, was very quick to help me resolve this issue with Amazon, and we should all be thankful to have that cleared up.<br /><br />The chips, like I said are very good. They do have a slightly salty aftertaste, but are so delicious I wish they were 24oz bags! I think they are onto something with the avocado oil.

"In my never-ending search to find odd, unusual and inexpensive beauty products I have finally found ""COCONUT OIL""!!!<br /><br />I read a beauty book recently <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892349"">Can You Get Hooked on Lip Balm?: Top Cosmetic Scientists Answer Your Questions about the Lotions, Potions and Other Beauty Products You Use Every Day</a> that claimed that natural, organic, cold pressed coconut oil was the only oil that could actually penetrate the hair shaft. It seems all other oils, including mineral, olive, and sunflower can only coat the hair, at best a temporary cure.<br /><br />What makes coconut oil special? Its about 90% saturated fatty acid which contains about 40% lauric acid. Among it's almost mythical and magical properties it is ""reputed"" to cure a host of maladies including high cholesterol, obesity, infections,(all highly doubtful)and dry hair and skin (believable). It is also a food product that can be used as a butter substitute a shortening and a frying oil. My interest, however, is hair, just hair.<br /><br />Interestingly, coconut oil solidifies at temperatures under 76 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an air conditioned home in a temperate climate, this oil will be solid most of the time. I decanted a few teaspoons into a small container from the wide jar the product comes in. I keep the original container in the refrigerator and the small one in the bathroom where it is usually much warmer than the rest of my house.<br /><br />When liquefied, this oil is fairly thick and milky looking. It smells deliciously of coconut. To me it tastes of .... coconut grease....but not in a totally bad way.<br /><br />To use this as a hair conditioner one needs to start slowly and experiment. Although my hair is thick it has a fairly fine texture. The first few times I used the oil I over applied it and my hair became flat and greasy looking.<br /><br />As a hair conditioner, it is recommended to coat your dry hair and scalp with the oil, cover your head with a towel and let it penetrate for an hour or two. Using non-conditioning shampoo, apply a small amount to your dry hair and rub it in without adding any water at first. Then, after the shampoo has been rubbed in, add small amounts of warm water until you build up a lather. Rinse, then shampoo again normally. Your hair will be very soft and smooth.<br /><br />As a hair dressing, use only a very tiny amount unless your have thick, very curly or kinky hair. I gave a friend with long thick curly hair some of the oil and she is completely in love with it.<br /><br />A little of this product goes a very long way. A jar should last a very long time.

One problem: It called for drizzling the final product with truffle oil. This was not something in my pantry.<br /><br />So, I checked out Amazon reviews of various Truffle Oil products. Most at some reasonable price feature olive oil, infused with a bit of truffle oil. Many of the products were negatively evaluated by reviewers. This tended to be responded to fairly positively. So, I took a shot and ordered a small bottle (3.5 ounces).<br /><br />And, boy, did it work out. It added a real richness to the final product. As a result, I am now more intrigued at the prospect of using truffle oil on recipes that might benefit (I just had a delightful dinner at Capital Grille, where French Fries were topped with parmesan cheese and truffle oil--quite tasty!).<br /><br />So, despite the reality that this is olive oil infused with truffle oil, it works well enough for me. . . .",pretty good for what it is; it adds to my recipes,4

I do have sensitive tastebuds, and can tell the differences and nuances between a Starbucks Sumatra and a Dunkin Donuts dark roast.  My taste ranges mostly for medium to strong flavored coffees.  This coffee is on the medium side of the flavor spectrum, and it's free of the sourness found in some store brands.  I would call it a mild medium, and I like the portable package as a way to break up the monotony of what's offered at the office.  I can keep a pack or 2 in my desk drawer whenever, as the individual wrapping for each pod is quite handy.  There's nothing terribly distinctive about it- just a clean tasting coffee.

"I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee.  When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY"">Newman's Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ"">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]",Another great dark K-cup coffee,4
"We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).",Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.

I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.

"I purchased this 9 pack in May of 2012.  Now it is September 2012 and I wanted to get some more of this very tasty fish in mustard sauce - it's the best canned fish I've found, with a long shelf life. High quality product, arrived on time with few-to-little dents. The mustard sauce is great.<br /><br />The problem here is my order in May cost under $9 (w/ free Prime shipping) for the 9 tins of fish.  The price now is $24 plus added $5 shipping.  No more Prime? No more Subscribe and Save? Come on Amazon, bring this back.  Tripling the price is not fair.<br /><br />It would be 5 stars for the product alone, but the insane price increase is not acceptable so one star is removed.<br /><br />EDIT 10/2012-  The price has come down a little bit to $20 with free Prime shipping but it is still nowhere near the original $9 I paid with my first order.  I went ahead and ordered anyway because I can't find this locally at all. This latest shipment had each tin individually wrapped in bubble wrap and there were ZERO dents in the tins.  Thank you Amazon for at least packaging these properly, even if the price is still too high.  It's good fish and the expiration date on this order (received in October 2012) is 12/31/2016.",This fish is fantastic - beware price increase!,4

"This might seem like an absurd idea, chocolate-flavored vinegar, and I can reassure you that the uses described on this product page -- especially marinating meats -- are guaranteed to nauseate your gourmet family and guests. But there is an interesting use for this and for the other Xtreme balsamics ... in home-made ice cream!<br /><br />Vinegar-flavored ice creams are currently a flourishing fad in parts of Europe, especially in Spain. The idea is to streak thin veins of vinegar through an otherwise too simpering a flavor. Balsamic works very well with strawberry, which is normally too sweet for my taste. This chocolate balsamic works in only very specific flavor contexts: with medium dark chocolate, with raspberry, with orange or blood orange (ice cream, not sorbet). Of course, you can experiment in any way you like. If you never make ice cream, or if somebody gives you a bottle of this stuff for the holiday, you're on your own. The latter was what happened to me.",Don't Laugh!,4

"I've been feeding my cat this food for about 7 months without any problems.<br />I mainly tried it because she was throwing up a lot with her previous Purina cat food.<br /><br />First the pros about this cat food:<br /><br />1. Its grain free, so cats that have sensitive stomachs (which was apparently my cat) can eat it without any problems.<br /><br />2. Since it contains less filler my cat tends to eat less, so I use less cat food overall.  I saw other reviewers complain about cost, but since she eats less I buy less so it seemed to even out.  Also, since she eats less she poops less, which I felt was the second best thing about this food (outside of not throwing up).<br /><br />3.  There's no added chemicals or preservatives in the food, so if your concerned with that its a plus.  Personally, I find that's a non-issue with me.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />1. Apparently this food can cause urinary crystals (a more serious problems in male then female cats), so you may want to monitor your cat at first if you change to this food. My cat didn't have this problem, but my cat is female so it is less of an issue.<br /><br />2. Like other reviewers, I found this food has a relatively strong smell when fresh.  The smell goes away as the food dries out.  In my case, my cat won't eat it when it dries out (she must enjoy the smell).  So I keep mine in an airtight food bin and only scoop out enough when she wants some.<br /><br />3. If your cat is like mine, you won't be able to use an auto-feeder with this cat food as it dries out when open to the air.  When I used an auto feeder, my cat refused to eat the food that no longer gave off the smell at the bottom of the feeder (took me a couple feedings to figure this out).  This is kind of annoying, but its better than cleaning up throw up.<br /><br />Overall, I think if your current food is causing problems than this food provides a good alternative to the major brand name foods.",Worth trying if your cat has problems with their current food.,4

"Let me put in a few qualifiers first. For one thing, I was drinking this at double strength, over ice, with vodka. I found that if you do make it the full on diluted version, it's got an off-putting taste that I can't put my finger on. However, at double strength, you can happily mix it with cocktails or blend it with ice to make a slushy, and you're in good shape.

"The ingredients show cheddar cheese as the primary cheese in these crackers, and mozzarella is less than 2%. Therefore they taste more cheddar than anything else.

"Dog treats. What do you do with dog treats? Well, if you have a dog that is very food-centered, then dog treats are the best thing going as you can use them as the necessary treats for helping in training your dog, or maintaining his/her training later on in their lives.<br /><br />We have a big dog, so training her is a must. These treats are definitely a hit with our pooch! They are also small enough that we do not feel too bad using several during a training session. They are dry squares with a look and feel of thick crackers. Once you open the bag, there are many pieces, but there is a line through the center which means that you can break them in half pretty easily. This extends the amount of them you can use by two.<br /><br />I cannot vouch for how they taste but they certainly attract my dog and she is very attentive when I bring the bag out. The label talks about the ingredients being organic, consisting of Lamb and Barley - which is all to the good as there are dogs that are not happy with corn-based products, etc.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice product and one that my dog appreciates, and I would definitely consider purchasing them at my store.",Crunchy treats for the dogs in our life,4

"Let me start by saying I'm reviewing this based on what it is...a bargain priced kit. It's not really fair to compare it to a $120 premium kit. With that said, I found it to be a solid product with nice flavor.<br /><br />Based on other reviews on Amazon and forums I knew that I shouldn't make this kit to the full 6 gallons or it would be weak and lack body. I only made it to 5 gallons, but I would recommend you make it based on specific gravity rather than volume, because mine came out a little strong. Mine came out to about 13% ABV. On a Cabernet or a more full-bodied wine that would be okay, but it's a little strong for a Riesling. They give you the recommended starting SG, so I would shoot for the middle of that, rather than filling to volume, but probably about 5 1/2 gallons is where you want to be. That will allow you to leave the sediment behind and still fill up a 5 gallon carboy. If you have left over, then keep it in a one gallon jug/carboy and use to top up later in the process.<br /><br />The flavor is still excellent and very drinkable. It was a dry kit, so I sweetened with 1 1/4 cups of wine conditioner. I added a little sorbate after clarifying and before adding the sweetner to avoid fermentation kicking off again. Give it a few days between adding the sorbate and sweetening to make sure fermentation is completely killed off. It's still not very sweet, so I would recommend 1 1/2 cups conditioner/sweetner to get closer to a Washington style Riesling.<br /><br />Overall I think the kit is a true bargain, especially with free super saver shipping. I've since ordered the Shiraz and so far it is exceeding expectations as well.",A Bargain Kit That's Really A Bargain,4
"I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.

He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.  I like it so much I went to a ""subscription"" status to save a little more money.

"I use Purina Cat Chow 3.5 pound bag of dry food as the base for my blend of four different foods for my two cats. I purchase these four bags, sit down with two large plastic containers and mix the four together. I keep them stirred so the four are well-blended. My two females love the taste of each of the four and they are getting the benefits of all four varieties (at least that is what my mind thinks).

The other one who does not have food issues lies patiently yet thinks she is getting such a treat when I put out a few pieces for her. She likes the Dental flavor the best.<br /><br />When I finish and put out a fresh bowl of food and water,  you talk about happy! The first one, Mizu, has snacked so much she eats just a few bites, then she's gone. Next Molly stretches and walks nonchalantly to the bowl and has her few bites.

"Okay, so this must be a sort of hybrid Gatorade/Monster/Sunny Delight offspring.  It contains lots of Vitamin C, other vitamins, 40 mg of natural caffiene, taurine (10 mg), and electorlytes, and you mix it all into a glass of water.  Convenient, very.  I hated it but my teenage son loves it.  It tastes like Kool-Aid to me, but he likes it when he goes on a walk, mixed in his water.  One bottle has 24 servings to mix in (goodness, what would happen if you didn't read the instructions...yikes!), so this little bottle could conceivably last awhile.  And, it's better than buying 24 separate bottles of vitamin water (too much plastic!).<br /><br />So I'm rating it good for convenience and the idea itself, but a better flavor would be nice.

"This brownie mix is expensive and I like the ones that I make at home better. (though they take a lot more work!)<br />I liked how I could just go to the store and buy a gluten free brownie mix for once, it saves a lot of time. They had a very rich chocolate taste, so I would advise that you cut the brownies small so that the taste isn't too overpowering. I'm not saying these brownies are bad or (though that might be what it sounds like from my very first sentence of this review.) that you shouldn't buy the mix and make them, I'm just saying that homemade is always better, though not too many of us have the time these days to make everything homemade.

I didn't use the pan size they said to use, but I will next time.

"I think this is the best choice for babies in the cracker category in terms of health and likability.  I had tried other types of crackers and they just threw them after biting into them. They like these and eat them and only sometimes throw them. Babies are amazing at how expressive they are when they don't want food offered to them.<br /><br />My ten month old twins eat these crackers, but not every time they're offered, and they're fairly healthy with the possible exception of saltiness.  They're by far the saltiest thing they eat.<br /><br />Considering that they need to put things in their mouths due to teething and basic discovery of the world, this is a great product to have on hand just to give them something edible that can go in the mouth.<br /><br />Getting it in a pack of 6 at this discount beats buying them one box at a time at the store.  I haven't seen this in a big box store yet, so I believe this must be one of the better deals at the moment.<br /><br />One box of these for babies around the age of mine (10 months) will last a long time.

"These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say ""one"" cookie, then ""half"" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth.",Tasty cookie -- even fiance likes it..,4

"We bought this for our 4 month old terrier (15lb). The thing I like best about this toy is that it fits his small puppy dog food, so I can just insert his day-to-day food without worrying about his diet being affected. It is HARD plastic so it is not a chew toy for his teeth like some of the other puzzles, and on our hardwood floors it can make a bit of a racket causing me to wonder about the scratch factor on the floors (but, oh well we have a dog AND kids).  Our pup was scared of it for the first few weeks due to the noise it makes but now it is one of his favorite puzzle toys. It has two settings: easy pour and somewhat easy pour.  Because of the hard plastic he really has to rely on the use of his front paws to get the food out rather than just his mouth (although he has mastered picking it up now.) It is a fun toy for him and a good thing to have around when he is restless and looking for trouble.<br /><br />Aug 2012 Update: Our terrier is now 25lb and he still loves this toy. It remains a good size for him even though he grew much bigger than we expected. He gets super excited whenever we pull it out.  He is fearful of thunderstorms and we use it as a positive reinforcement tool when the skies grey and the wind picks up.  He gets distracted by the puzzle ball and forgets all about the weather.  It is too big (or maybe it is too loud and too hard in texture) for our 8lb dog - she will not play with it even though she wants the food inside.",hard plastic toy - a few years later,4

"A friend alerted me to these six-packs of Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes, which I had been purchasing individually at local supermarkets. The mixes are easy to make, and they've worked well with my Cuisinart bread machine. I've especially liked the wheat bread mix.

"Let's face it , coffee that has already been ground is never going to be as good as fresh ground. For already ground coffee this is pretty good. Not as good as I expected though from other readers.  I also purchased it because they use this brand in Denney's restauarant and I always loved their regular coffee. I think the vanilla is what I am not liking so much in this and I would rather add my own natural vanilla syrup made with sugar not corn syrup. I will buy the plain Millstone  and hope it tastes a little like Denney's. I did like it better when I brewed it really strong like espresso, and boiled milk to add to it. It smoothed out the strong vanilla taste. Oh, used a french press with it. Thinking about going to the Cuizinart pod 200.00 coffee maker for variety and ease of use. Expensive but maybe might be worth the investment  the way we use coffee around here. Also can use the hot water for instant  soups, noodles etc. I really want great tasting coffee tea or hot chocolate when I want it.

"Yes, I know that Coca Cola already makes a cherry product, but it's not cherry enough for me so I augment the cherry cokes I buy (2-liters) with a splash of this cherry syrup.

Hi! I bought a case of Bean & Body Coffee Anti-Ox from Warehouse Deals. Thus the price was reduced. The drink was very good. I'd say flavor would have been better if item was not approaching the best by date. Fresher if newer but more expensive. That's my reason for 4 stars. Full price is a bit much in these times.

"This is a very tasty nutrition bar. It has 160 calories, 2 grams of fat, 20 mg of sodium, 3 grams of protein, and 22 grams of sugar.

"First of all: I bought the med/lg size for my 70 lb, 18 month old lab puppy, and I think it is a little too big. This may help you in deciding what size to buy your dog. The rop and opening ball are the right size, but the bottle is so big he can hardle pick it up (no fun).<br /><br />Positive: this toy has single-handedly kept my dog occupied more than any other toy (other than Nylabones). He is infatuated with it! He LOVES it! He is pretty angry and still hasn't figured out how to get the treats out (which suprises me because he is very intelligent).<br /><br />Negative: After very little effort the rope ended up in 3 strands. It is not durable or tightly woven at all. Also, I didn't buy the treats suggested to go with it, but rather broke our treats into tiny pieces......but it is actually hard to get the treats out!

She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it. It also gives her pretty bad breath, but these are both things I can live with to eliminate the stained carpets.<br /><br />We have been using the food for over 2 years with no problems; I definitely recommend it if your dog has a sensitive stomach.",Only thing that will settle in my Bichon's stomach,4

"I am a new mom and was first looking for a petite blender.  I got this baby cooker because I thought I would save me a lot of time cooking and blending the baby food.  Our kitchen is tiny so the size of the baby cooker was important and the Beaba Baby cook is nice and small.  The product is great when my baby was around 4 to 7 months, but her nutritional needs greatly increased by nine months.  Before, I use it twice a week and it supplied plenty of baby food for that week.  All you had to do is freeze it and defrost for meals.  Now, I have to use it everyday, which is okay if I had the time.  However coming home from work, sometimes, I just want to prepare  frozen foods quickly.  So now,  I am using the traditional method of cooking her vegetables and meats in a big pot and blending it in a bigger blender as well.  I still like the Beaba babycook, but its size limits its convenience factor.<br />Also, after four months, the bowl to cook/blend has a crack and I am in the process of replacing it.  Customer service was great; SC admitted that the bowl was defective and is giving me a replacement.  I give this product four stars because it still does its job even with the crack and made me motivated to cook baby food.  I got one as a present for an expecting friend.

The instructions indicate to use within 24 hours of opening.  In my nephew's case, he's 6 months old.

"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter.

"If, like my wife and I, you're blessed with soft tap water, and like a good robust ""English Breakfast Tea"", I've found that this blend (mostly dark assam) is a pretty decent choice, and a good value.  I believe it's packaged by the same company that makes ""PG-Tips"" in the handy pyramid bags.  The quality is comparable.  I generally buy the brooke bond loose for making everyday tea by the pot, and I buy pg tips pyramid bags for travelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I buy the Brooke Bond loose on a regular basis - either online, or at a local indo-pakistani grocer.  I've also bought the Taj Mahal label by the same company, but they appear to be interchangeable, and differ only by the art on the box.  The loose tea is in small granule form, and comes sealed in a foil pouch, for freshness ... it's not flushed with neutral gas, and they dont vaccum pack it because they dont want to crush the tea, but otherwise the quality is pretty decent.  It comes in a variety of sizes, buy the most common size I buy is 900 grams (2 lbs) or 1800 gr (4lbs).<br /><br />The resulting tea is not quite as floral as some assams I've had (hey, it's bulk tea), and there's often a modest amount of tea dust in the bottom of the pouch, but the dust is easily removed by pouring the dry tea into a fine strainer, and tapping the strainer over the garbage (to winnow it), before brewing it.<br /><br />In my household, I generally buy loose tea in bulk, de-dust it, then repackage it in one or more 40 fl oz glass jars using a univeral vaccum sealing lid (see Tilia Food Saver), and then I use those to periodically refill a smaller 16-24 oz convenience container that I keep near my stove, for whenever I want to brew a fresh pot of tea.<br /><br />I've found that 1/4 cup of loose tea is sufficient for a 6 cup pot, and 1/4 - 1/3 cup is sufficient for 8 cups.  After brewing is done (3-5 mins), I pour the brewed tea through a fine tea strainer into serving cups, and the surplus goes into a lidded glass carafe that gets stored in the fridge (after it cools) for subsequent reheating by the cup (re: microwave), or for use in iced tea by the jug (just add some simple syrup and fresh lemon juice to taste, and some optional bruised mint leaves, and you're good to go).<br /><br />Bottom line - for an inexpensive loose bulk tea, this brand is very decent all purpose choice, suitable for both hot and iced tea.

"****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.","Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue",4

I really have to watch the portion control.<br /><br />Now that I am used to the spiciness, if I'm not paying attention I can chomp through a bag pretty quickly and that is potent stuff. It's better for the calories and the teeth to work through the candies slowly right? But yikes these things are sweet-spicy good!<br /><br />On the other hand my husband tried one only to spit his into his dinner napkin pretty disgusted....So, definitely an acquired taste.<br /><br />One observation as a simple hard-candy-eating, non-medical, lay-person, who suffers with severe asthma, these things were soothing to the throat and chest on a couple of rough breathing days.<br /><br />With the next shipment of ginger drops I am also getting a bag of the clove flavored candies just to see if they will be able to stand up to the ginger so I'll have an alternate. :)","For me instantly addicting, others, acquired taste",4

"A review from Crystal Starr Light's cat, Emma Starr Light:<br /><br />My pet has gotten into the habit of giving me dry food in the morning when she is gone for work and, if I look really pathetic (humans are really susceptible to this in general, but my pet is even worse than most), a 5.5oz can of wet food at night (I typically eat shreds or flakes or, if my pet forgets what I like, pate).  Of course, I would prefer to have canned food twice a day and skip the whole dry food all together, but alas, I haven't been able to knead that out of her yet.<br /><br />One day my pet came home with a package of Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats she got in the mail through her ""Vine"" program, or something like that (I don't bother with those boring human things usually).  She opened the package and placed a small chunk on a plate for me.  I took one sniff and said, ""Yeah, see ya laters.""<br /><br />But when she wasn't looking, I decided to have a better sniff.  It smelled pretty good--very authentic tuna (by the way my pet was reacting, it was as if it were super strong and potent or something--humans!).  So I nibbled it all, and it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />A couple of nights later, my pet gave me a whole third.  WHOA!  Talk about a lot of tuna there!  It must have taken half a day to eat the whole thing--not to mention, I had to get my paws dirty in order to move it around on the plate so I could eat it (NOTE TO PET: it's not a bad thing to split my food up into smaller chunks!).<br /><br />I like it, and it hasn't done anything nasty to my digestion (hey, a cat's got to be worried about her digestion!).  My pet likes the ziplock bag it comes with, as she can put it in her fridge, and it doesn't smell up the rest of her spoiled food (Crystal: HEY!!!!  Not everything in my fridge is spoiled!).  She doesn't, however, like how much splatter can result from trying to get out tuna from the bag.  Not that I blame her; I hate getting things on my paws (means more washing).  I can't actually believe this is a ""treat"", unless by ""treat"" you mean ""dinner"".  Three slices would more than last me at least two meals.<br /><br />I don't know if my pet will buy this again.  A can of cat food is like 50 cents and this is almost 10 bucks--do you know how many cans of cat food you could buy for 10 bucks?!  20!  20 delicious cans of delectable deliciousness.  Enough for breakfast and dinner for 10 days!  Or just dinner for 20 days!  One package of this stuff would last three days, most likely.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br /><br />Emma Starr Light, C.S. Light's cat","""Gimme gimme more, gimme more""",4

"The stress of a tough year is starting to get to me. I've been puckered up so tight for so long, I'm afraid my puckerer may have frozen that way.<br /><br />So I've been searching for inner peace -- and outer unpuckering -- in personal relaxation products. But expensive gadgets and doodads would just angry my blood up further, so I'm seeking Samadhi on a shoestring budget.<br /><br />When my wife goes to a spa to relax, she always gets some kind of oatmeal facial scrub treatment. I don't know much about pampering, but I'm intimately familiar with a wide variety of hot breakfast cereals. If oatmeal on the face is relaxing, then I'd sure give it a try.<br /><br />I heated several packets of the oatmeal in the microwave, per the cooking instructions, added a little milk and layered it onto my face. I'm not sure what's supposed to happen next in a 'professional' treatment, but in my bathroom, a lot of it just glooped off into the sink. The rest felt... well, like oatmeal on my face. Sticky. Warm. Lumpy, in a way that was less 'relaxing' and more 'get it off my face-y'.<br /><br />The oatmeal did smell nice, and made me sort of hungry, but I don't think I relieved any stress by putting it on my face instead of IN my face. Maybe next time I'll try wearing it with eggs over easy, or a rasher of bacon. Bacon makes *everything* peaceful.","The Right Food to Wear, and a Tasty Way to Wear It",4

"This is a great item to bring to a party or enjoy with friends on movie night. The mix of seeds and chocolate is just right--slightly indulgent, but not a bag of candy. I bought it to share with family members who have dairy and nut allergies, but everyone dug right in, and went back for more. It's a light mix, very flavorful, and just right for snacking or enjoying with a casual meal. Some people in our party even put it on top of their fruit salad.<br /><br />A few other reviewers mentioned splitting it up into six separate containers, and that's what we did, even though we served one whole bag of it at once: we split it into six small glass dishes and let everyone dish his own with tablespoons. I think splitting it up does keep the mixture just right, without letting the heavier seeds settle to the bottom.<br /><br />A lot of trail mixes get stuck in your teeth, and I have to say, that was not a problem with this one. Whether allergies are in your life or not, I highly recommend this mix.<br /><br />I only wish it were organic. (Then I would give it five stars.)","Great for everyone, allergic or not!",4
"Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K"">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.",Two enthusiastic paws up,4

"These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."" I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions ""tear here."" So easy. Why didn't I think of that.",A unique flavor for fans of Thai food,4
"I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%.

"I read a lot about this food prior to making my purchase. My dog recently suffered from life-threatening bloat...amazingly she survived :) To reduce the chances of future bloat I am now feeding her 4-5 times a day instead of only once. After researching, I found that a food high in protein and low in carbs/corn type grains was healthier and possibly less likely to cause bloat (there is very little known as to the causes of bloat so most information is just theoretical...no definitive findings). Well, I was happy to find that Blue Buffalo foods seemed to be tailored to exactly what I was in search of! In addition, my dog suffers from allergies and I had been supplementing her with Alaskan Salmon Oil for added Omega-3 and Omega-6. After reading about the Blue Buffalo Fish & Sweet Potato food I saw that it offered the additional Omega's and that if she was to eat it I would no longer need to do the separate supplement. Everything sounded wonderful! I placed my order and it arrived promptly. I tried getting her to eat the food for about a week or two before I decided it was a no go :( I tried mixing it with hot water for gravy...still, she never did take to it. She is typically a very accepting dog when new foods are introduced...however, with this food she was not. I wasn't bothered by the smell as were some other reviewers, but I'm not surprised by that since I had become accustomed to the salmon oil smell already. All in all, I do wish she had taken to the Blue Buffalo brand foods as I really like the approach they take with the ingredients and preparation methods. I tried her on the Lamb flavor too but she refused that as well. Although my experience with Blue Buffalo brand turned out to be one that wouldn't work, I would still recommend giving it a try for your pampered pup. It is a great food! Great ingredients!

"Seriously, I was very happily surprised with this excellent brown bread. I found it to be nice and moist, with the texture and even the taste reminding me a bit of fresh gingerbread or a good rich muffin. The problem I had, however, was not insignificant. I exchanged emails with a very nice and accommodating representative of B&M, and apparently I got a can with inside walls that somehow escaped being thinly coated with vegetable oil. Hence, especially since the inside of the can has horizontal ridges, vertical to the direction that the bread needs to be slid, the can had a fiendish death grip on the bread. The instructions say you may need to ease the bread out by using a spoon. If only. This only creates a cave in the bread, maybe useful if you are into bread sculpting. Even using the cutaway lid, which should be the perfect size, you just keep compressing the bread on that side, of course with every quarter-inch or so of compression you're losing slices you paid for. The simplest way for me was sliding a thin steak knife around the edge, but since, again, the can has those internal ridges, you end up mangling/losing part of the product. Overall, ordering this bread as long-term backup is perfect for me, so I will probably order again. But it is a little depressing that we just launched another rover to Mars, to join another that is still operational, yet we can't manage to get a simple vegetable oil coating consistently inside of a can of bread.

"Ziti with meat sauce is the flavor of Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers I received from the program. I liked it, although it is a little too spicy for my taste. It has a smooth texture and the pasta doesn't clump. My husband likened this (in a good way) to Beefaroni. I like the fact that you add water, microwave for 2.5 minutes, then strain with the cover, then mix in the sauce. However, the instructions for cooking should be on the separate sauce packet and not the side of the container, which is impossible to look at without spilling once you've added the water. The entire thing except for the plastic overwrap is recyclable, too, if that might thrill you.  This did inspire me to try other flavors from the grocery store, specifically chicken teriyaki, which I also liked but not quite as much as this flavor.

This reminds me of a local ginger ale found only in Middle Kentucky called ""Ale-8-1"". It's full of ginger flavor, but in a very good way. If you get this one, don't be put off by the overwhelming ginger smell, it's not nearly as strong as it smells, which is a good thing to me. It would definitely be a matcha I reach for when I'm headed into work with an upset stomach, but need a pick me up. I don't think it's one I'll keep in stock, but it's not one I'll be actively trying to swap away either. I'm excited to try it with the cranberry. If you're familiar with ginger ale brands, it's more of a Vernor's than anything else. Lord have mercy, I spend way too much time with ginger ale, apparently. But if I can talk my Dad into trying matcha, this will definitely be the one I lead with. Who knows, my father in law greatly enjoyed the French Vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea, maybe my dad can be won over as well!",Putting the ginger back in ginger ale!,4

"I received this as a gift, and did not realize how expensive this little package of caramels was, but they were DELICIOUS! I did not cook with them or bake with them so I cannot say what they would be like in that scenario. I can say they were very delicious just by themselves. In response to the reviews that the caramels were putrid or greasy, I must admit they were greasy and this is probably due to the butter used as a main ingredient. Overall, despite the fact that the grease from the caramels permeated the package, these things are quite tasty. I have not decided if this makes them worth the price, but the caramels are of the highest quality. So you decide! (Four stars for the price!)",a lot of $ for a delicious product!,4

I like 5 hr. Energy drink.  I have been drinking it for a couple mo.  I was doubtful at first but what the heck.I bought a couple bottles and put them in my fridge.  Couple days later I am busy in the kitchen and feeling run down.  I drank a bottle of 5 hr. Energy and layed down for a few minutes thinking of catching a small nap.

"I have a problem with many reviews calling this a ""healthy"" sweetener for it is NOT healthy, just a better substitute than many others out there. Although not a ""healthy"" sweetener, it taste great and taste pretty much just like the organic Sucant sugar I usually use for baking.<br /><br />The first ingredient in Ideal is Xylitol (not very sweet by itself) which is iffy with health foodies (they say it is too processed just like white sugar) and then Ideal adds two other ingredients that are definitely unhealthy. Maltrodextrin is more often than not derived from corn (usually GMO corn) which is NOT healthy and the other ingredient is Sucralose which is Splenda which is NOT healthy because your body cant recognize it and doesnt know what to do with it therefore making it harder on your system than sugar and harder to digest.<br /><br />I'm huge into whole food holistic eating and buy stevia leaves or stevia powder which is truly zero calories and not bad on your system; yet, it does have a minor aftertaste you have to get used to. If you are looking for a sweetener that is not unhealthy turn to 100% stevia and is fine for diabetics. Again, this Ideal brand xylitol is mixed with corn sweetener and splenda and although not healthy, does taste great!",It Certainly isn't Healthy,4
"This sour cream flavored snack is a savory delight...but could use a boost in fiber and protein to offset the carbs.

This tuna is sustainably caught and so far the only sustainably caught tuna that does not come in a can that I have seen. It tastes good and a lot better than canned tuna.

"BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you'll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal.","PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT LIKE PIZZA CRUST",4
"Ok, here is the truth - this freeze dried coffee is GOOD.  Long time ago (maybe 20 yrs) I tried the freeze dried stuff and thought it was a bit on the bitter side in taste, so never tried it again.  So here I am, years later writing Taster's Choice parent company asking for samples.  They sent me a few, and boy was I blown away at how tasty the Vanilla and Hazlenut flavors were.  I ended up gong to the local Walmart and cleaned their shelf of these flavors.  Yes, that is how well I liked this coffee.  HOWEVER, as tasty as this stuff is, there is a down side...<br /><br />The reviews on amazon are correct, in that the size of the individual packets are RIDICULOUSLY small.  This is why I am giving a four star rating instead of a five star.  Be forewarned - if you want a typical 8-oz cup of this coffee in the morning, you WILL have to use two full packets to achieve the taste of a regular strength of coffee.  Having said that, know that you are told on the box of this product that you are buying a TWENTY COUNT box.  In reality, it is a TEN COUNT box.  Who do you know only drinks 6-oz of coffee in their cup each morning?  That is what the packets are - 6 oz!  I do not, repeat, do not like strong coffee, so even I would have to complain that this company needs to stop pre-packing for a 6-oz cup.  Nescafe needs to sell this product in a single jar container so that customers can choose how much coffee to stir in their cup each day.<br /><br />Its all about profit, I know.  But if Nescafe wants to truly listen to customers, then they will stop pre-packing such small quantities and let the consumer have this product in a larger container.  I will pay for it anyway, but atleast stop pre-measuring for me.","First skeptical, then SOLD!",4

"For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!",Good enough!,4
"As all Hi-chews are, the melon flavor is very chewy and juicy. However, if you do not like melon flavor, this is not for you.

"I absolutely love Chicago-style cheese and caramel popcorn like Garrett's.  So, feeling a craving for the stuff, I decided to try this gourmet cheddar cheese popcorn.  It was delicious, but very salty.  The cheese is also not the same quality of stuff that they use in the better Chicago popcorn shops.  Frankly, it didn't taste as cheesy and a bit fake.  The popcorn itself was quite fresh though.<br /><br />All in all, I guess if you're desperate for some gourmet-esque popcorn, this stuff is good.  However, in my book, it doesn't compare to the real, fresh gourmet popcorn shops' stuff.",Delicious But SALTY,4
"Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock.  Ours was actually 15+ years old when we opened it, and it was deliciously smooth, with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel.  Kick was in the mid-palette, clean finish.  I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap.  I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up, so if you have a couple of whiskey stones, I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping.  More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don't have stones would be a travesty - this is some really, really good bourbon.","Warm and smooth, best with a couple of whiskey stones",4

We had one instance of diarrhea after eating this for lunch, but since it only happened once, I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the salmon package, but definitely I keep an eye for now.

"I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a ""supermarket brand"". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup.

You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house.

"I've tried several flavors of Hormel Compleats (not because I adore the stupid spelling, let me assure you)); and this Meatloaf flavor I think is the best of what I've sampled.  If it weren't a Compleat (which by Hormel's own apparent definition must me edible and little more), this would get my five-star applause.  I grade on what is offered.<br /><br />Yeah, the potatoes are OK.  The gravy is at least better than some others.  The surprise?  The meatloaf has some real flavor!  I'm not normally a big meatloaf fan (didn't care for the singer, either); but this really ain't bad at all.  Has spices and tastes like somebody really tried on this one.<br /><br />I don't mean to slap Compleats around, really.  I actually eat a lot of them; but not because I'm looking for delicious meals.  I'm looking for quick and easy meals.  As an old fart living alone, I don't much like to spend time cooking things up.

So what's not to love?<br /><br />Well, there is one thing -- as of this writing, a box of 12 bars runs nearly thirty dollars!  Even other organic fruit bars can be had for less than half that much.  I'm not sure what makes Fruition bars so pricey.  But I can't imagine paying that much for a dozen fruit bars.","Tastes good, healthy for a filling snack, and costs how much???",4

"I have a nine month old baby who I have decided to feed a gluten free diet for at least the first year. I found these and they seemed like something she would enjoy. They are the perfect size for her little fingers. She is so cute when she eats them. She seems to like the chocolate better, and gets it all over her face. They are not too sweet, which makes me feel better about giving them to children. I tasted them, and while a little chalky, they are some of the best gluten free cookies I have had. If you want them to taste just like cookies containing gluten, you won't be happy. But if you want a pretty darn good gluten free cookie these are it. My own gluten free mommy tried them, and said there was no way she would be able to order a case from Amazon because she would eat them all wayyy too fast.","My baby loves them, and I agree",4

There's gotta be MSG in this stuff, because - wow, it's addictive.<br /><br />The onions and garlic definitely cheapen the flavor to me, so it only gets four stars, but if you like dried or granulated onions and garlic, you'll dig this dressing.

"We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the ""Oreo Biscuit"").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the ""modern"" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for ""hill""), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the ""cream"" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: ""Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees"").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.",Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack,4

"For the real chai, that is.  Which is not latte (i.e. not foamed).  I much prefer my own homemade chai, but this is a very good substitute for a quick cuppa.  I detest the chai powders which are disgustingly sweet.  The only manufactured chai that I like was the Tazo chai concentrate (Starbucks uses Tazo), but they changed their formula last year and I don't like the new stuff.  When I bought the Tassimo, one of the requirements was that it HAD to make chai latte.  The Twinings Chai Latte is pretty durned good for a quick brew cuppa.  Yes, it is a bit sweet, but so are all the other chai's out there.  Tazo is sweet too.  This chai latte is actually finitely tuned so that you can actually taste the tea in it.  The creamer is not overpowering.  My only complaint is that when I drink chai, I like a grande.  Not the 10 oz mug you get with these disks.  So I often find myself brewing 2 cups (4 disks total including creamers) to satisfy my craving.  If Tazo were to go back to its old formula, I would probably prefer it because of strong ginger flavour.  However, at the moment, this is the closest second, to my own home brew, that I can get.",very good substitute,4

"We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that ""baby food"" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U"">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.

"I have always loved Oreo cookies, splitting them in half and doubling up on the insides (way before Double Stuff Oreo cookies).  Dunking them in milk is also a favorite thing to do.  So when I heard there was a new Oreo product out I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />First of all the packaging is great it is a thin plastic / metallic wrapping that pulls open and than self sticks when you close which keeps the cookies closed.  All though the bag is dark and it is hard to see the cookies inside so I almost threw out the last two.  You don't get as many cookies as a normal Oreo package.  I believe my bag had 27 cookies with a serving being 3 cookies (really 5 is closer to what you will eat at a time).<br /><br />Taste wise they taste like the peanut butter cookies from the Girl Scouts perhaps a tad bit thinner.  The cookies are great but if you gave me a blind taste test and asked if I felt there was any Oreo in the cookie I would say no.

"Coconut water is great as a natural substitute to all those artificial electrolyte drinks. Problem is, it's a bit of a fad right now. You can't find them sold everywhere and they are often on the expensive side. That, and many of them come from far-away places and if you're bothered by the thought of all the added cost of shipping palettes of packaged water, this product is the answer!<br /><br />From what I can tell, this product is nothing but coconut water, in powdered form. Sure, it might not taste as fresh as water from a fresh coconut, but I can carry this anywhere, I can travel with it, and I can mix some up any time I want. The convenience alone is great, but knowing the manufacturer doesn't have to pay all the overhead for shipping it in water form is wonderful.<br /><br />This dissolves pretty easily, but pouring it into regular temperature (tap) water instead will make it dissolve faster than if you pour this into a glass with ice cubes (in case you want to add this into a glass of ice water at a restaurant).<br /><br />Highly recommended!",Great solution!,4

"I'm quite choosy about my hygienic products -- toothpastes, soaps, washes and so on. In an effort to find a bath wash that wasn't too obnoxious or coarse in it's ingredients, I've been through a couple brands. Knowing this, this one came as a gift from my girlfriend at the time. So far, this is one of my favorites. I don't really have sensitive skin per se but the mildness of both it's fragrance and it's texture, or lack thereof, work good for my skin. The only minus, though I personally don't mind, is that it is advertised as ""unscented"" yet a scent is clearly apparent.<br /><br />It has no impact on the actual relevance of the product as a cleansing agent but I really like the look of the graphic design and industrial design of the product itself. The color scheme is nice and the bottle is easy to handle without slipping out of my hands. When the bath soap is getting low it also seems to do well at getting the last bits out unlike a lot of other brands I've tried where you have to pound the thing to get the last quarter of liquid out.

"It's funny... my first though was immediately ""Green Apple Jolly Rancher""... which was the conclusion of the most helpful critical review. I don't come with criticism though-- I enjoy it.<br /><br />The flavor is familiar and seems low acid compared to a lot of other packet drink options that are sugar free.  There may be a little more color/dye than I prefer, but it dissoved nicely and adds nice variety to the monotony of the flavors available in mix-yourself drinks.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because the flavor name is a little misleading-- I was imaginging this to be something that could easily be made into a mixed drink. If you want a green apple Jolly Rancher, then ok!~ But otherwise, the name might be a little inaccurate in my opinion.<br /><br />Refreshing, different, worth it to me for the variety.",A nice low acid sugar free,4

They are not made for use as ""teabags with coffee"" and they are not meant for Keuring machines.  If you put Keurig cup inside a regualar drip coffee maker, would you expect coffee to come out the other end?<br /><br />Now for those who have a Keurig machine and bought these, there is a solution.  If you have one of the cartridges that allow you to use loose coffee, for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, then you can cut off one end of the pod and use the coffee.

When you open it, you are hit by the smell of strong coffee - perhaps even to the point of being pungent.  When brewed, however, it is strong but not overpowering and actually has a surprising sweetness to it one would not have expected from the aroma.  This is not a coffee that would appeal to those used to the mass produced variety or those who prefer a mild brew.  It is fairly strong and best savored rather than guzzled.

"We come from a tropical country where coconuts are in abundance. We have grown up drinking fresh coconut water knowing fully well its health benefits over all those carbonated, artificially flavored drinks that contain a lot of bad than good.<br /><br />In the US, there is no way you are going to get fresh coconut water that is as tasty. So we shopped around quite a bit and tried out several different brands (from oriental stores, local farmer's market and Whole Foods) before settling down on O.N.E. Most brands (esp. those from the oriental stores) tasted down right awful and there were nothing like the natural coconut water. To make matters worse these had weird preservatives added in (which is a big NO NO). A handful few came close (that were found in Whole Foods), but taste wise O.N.E was definitely the best one.<br /><br />Ah..one more thing..always drink this chilled (tastes a lot better).<br /><br />Here are the reasons to like it...<br />- It's very close to the FRESH coconut water<br />- The tetra pack they use is BPA free and the packaging says its lightly pasteurized and there are no added chemicals<br /><br />Why its not rated 5 stars (YET)...<br />- We hope they will step up and make everything organic (to completely eliminate unwanted pesticides and fertilizers).<br />- Not much is known about how the coconuts are grown, where they are grown, how they are harvested etc.<br />- Its not certified ""Fair Trade"", so we do not know how the farmers are being paid. O.N.E says that their coconuts are from Brazil (so we hope the coconut farmers are paid their equal share).<br />- We hope they will make the product labeling a lot more clearer and provide more details on their pasteurizing process.",Closest thing to Fresh Coconut Water!!!,4

"I'll be honest, I bought these on a whim because I needed another item to push me over the minimum for SuperSave shipping.  I was browsing pantry items because I figured I might as well buy something I'd need anyways, and I came across these chips when looking for healthy snacks.  While I'm not typically a big consumer of ""natural"" foods (nothing against them, I just don't go out of my way to sneak them out), I try to stay away from obviously unhealthy foods and thought it couldn't hurt to try these as a substitute for less-healthy snacks like chips.  My expectations weren't very high, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these chips are really pretty tasty.  They're salty and crunchy yet not greasy.  I'm not saying I wouldn't prefer regular old potato chips all else equal, but if you're looking for a healthy alternative and debating giving these a try, I say go for it (because we all know ""all else"" isn't really equal...).",Pretty darn good,4

The seasoning is decent as well.  They have a surprising amount of a great sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients are okay as far as healthiness.  I like that rice flour is the first ingredient rather than potatoes or corn.  You still get oil, although less than normal chips.

"My dogs favorite dry food is the cats leftover science diet, if she can get it, so I'm not too sure about her street creds when it comes to choosing dog food, however she likes the Purina Beneful original dog food  for the time being. Any dry food she doesn't turn her nose up at is a plus.<br /><br />The bag shows chunks of real beef and veggies as well as a picture of the actual food. I don't think a reasonable person would expect to pour out actual beef chunks any more then they would expect to pour a fully frosted cake , like the one on the front of the box, from a box of cake mix. The product page and the back of the bag give the ingredients.  I sort of question the addition of sugar and I suppose the color is for the benefit of the owner but ,from what I've read, the chicken byproducts ( feet, neck etc) are good for the dog. No animal ""waste"" can be used. The word ""meal"" means the byproduct is received in a dry state instead of a wet state.<br /><br />I think the bottom line is do you trust the reputation and integrity of the manufacturer? It's probably not gourmet food but do you trust them to put out a healthy product? Do you believe they get their ingredients from a reputable company and run all the required salmonella and bacterial tests?

"My favorite Bear Valley bars are the Carob Cocoa and the Fruit'n Nut ones, but they were out of them a few weeks ago so I thought I'd try this one for the first time.  While I have to admit that it's a bit on the dry side, the flavor is unusual but not unplesant.  And the dryness might actually be a very good sign: it means that they didn't add a lot of oil or butter to moisten it up...just eat it with a glass of milk or water/tea/coffee, I suppose.  No biggy...the pros still far far outweigh the cons:<br /><br />Because like the rest of the Bear Valley bars, it is a complete protein and has an unbeatable dollars-per-calorie value. I'm a very physically-active male with a high metabolism, yet I really CAN eat this bar as a meal replacement, it keeps me feeling full but never bloated or gassy (unlike many others) for a good 3-5 hours...that would normally require at least two ClifBars or at least 3 of a cheap grocery store granola bar. Anyway, if you just need a little snack to tie you over for an hour or so, have just half of a bar at a time.<br /><br />I've also eaten 1/4 to 1/3 of these bars at a time just before a long run or during (about every 45 minutes) a long run, and with no ill effects stomach-wise. That, in my opinion, is a good testament to its digestibility and quality, organic ingredients.<br /><br />The only TINY gripe I have about these bars is that it's damn near impossible to tear open the wrapper with your bare hands unless you take something sharp and slash a hole first...so I just use a pair of scissors, quick and easy. But then again maybe that's a good thing, means you are assured of these things staying fresh for a long time without needing a bunch of artificial preservatives.","Not SUPER-delish, but not that bad either.",4

"My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.",my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands,4

"We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake ""healthier"" for ""healthy.""  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.

He did great on it for all that time.  Great coat, firm stool, easy to maintain weight, and great blood tests at his yearly check-ups.  We were extremely active, with daily runs and walks, play at the park, etc. But digestibility was always a bit on the low side. If I cut the volume of food down, he would loose weight before any noticeable decrease in stool size.<br />I could also use the kibble for training, as he really liked the flavor.<br /><br />My Girl Friend's Rottie is on a mix of this with Canidae All Life Stages.  She is a high drive, work-aholic! Honest, you would be hard pressed to find a more active dog.  She does amazingly well on this.  Stunningly beautiful coat, great digestibility, easily maintained weight.  She has been on this mix for about 2 years now, and she is seven.  No kidney issues with high protein, but we will watch as she ages. Her focus, and attention seems more rock solid too on this mix...<br /><br />At Super-Mutts yearly check-up (when he was 10-1/2) we noticed kidney functions were out of whack.

"I have become a huge fan of Demi Glace and my family loves it as well.  It is expensive, but once you learn to make sauces with it you will win a lot of fans.  I am nothing more than a father that cooks when I get home from work so I have no expertise other than what I have learned over the years feeding kids.  However, once I started using Demi Glace to make sauces with chicken, pork and beef it brought a flavor to meals that I only had when dining out at more expensive places.  I love the Roasted Chicken and the De Viande Gold for just about everything I cook.  My wife loves my sauces just for dipping bread. I seldom ever see a bad review for any Demi Glace product and if there is a bad review I believe the person using it just doesn't take the time to learn how to cook with it.

"I loved the energy I got from the 5 hour energy. It was quick and natural and helped me feel alert, but I did not experience any jitters or shakiness that usually accompanies when I drink an energy drink. It also gave me the most energy out of any energy drink I've ever used. When the energy did wear off it didn't feel like a crash. It was a completely natural and gradual decrease as the day went on. I found I was able to get a lot more done in my day.<br /><br />I recently used the 5 Hour energy on a long trip I took with my kids. Normally a few minutes into the trip I'm struggling with alertness and usually have to drink a lot of energy drinks to stay awake. But with one 5 Hour energy I was able to drive the entire trip without any additional energy drinks. I was alert and focused and felt better than I had in a long time. At the end of our journey instead of having an energy crash and needing to go straight to bed, I didn't even notice that it was wearing off and I never felt tired until it was time to go to bed that night. This was after getting only 4 hours of sleep the night before the trip. the 5 Hour energy definitely did it's job and I will always use one before I make any future driving trips!<br /><br />I love that the 5 Hour Energy bottles are just a small dose bottle instead of a full sized soda drink that I have to chug down before I can feel any increase in energy. And even better, you don't even need the entire bottle! Just drink half for a medium amount of energy or the entire thing for a huge dose in energy. And what you don't drink stays good for up to 3 days in the fridge, so you can have one ""pick me up"" on day 1 and use the rest on day 3.<br /><br />Cons: I think some of the flavors can be improved. At first I didn't like the flavor at all, and in fact choked on it and literally had to gag it down. The next day I had left the 5 hour energy in the fridge and then I was able to drink it with a lot more ease. Although there was still a definite after taste similar to that of a Diet soda.<br /><br />I think I would enjoy a flavor other than Berry a lot better. Yet if you are used to diet sodas or energy drinks you probably won't notice any distaste in the flavors. I'm used to drinking just straight up caffeinated sodas so it was a bit different for me.<br /><br />Of all the energy drinks I've tried, the 5 Hour energy definitely gave me the most energy!

"Kellogg's Crunchy nut cereal consists of Cornflakes that have been doused in a honey-sugar combo and sprinkled with very small pieces of chopped peanuts. They taste exactly like they sound -- a mostly honey-flavored variation of Cornflakes. In other words, they taste a lot like Frosted Flakes. The peanuts add very little taste-wise, and the pieces are so small that I can't imagine they contribute much in terms of protein (a serving size has 2 grams of protein).

"At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  ""real""beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.",Worthwhile treats,4

"I usually buy Indian mixed pickles in a large can but gave the MTR brand a shot and was pleasantly surprised. Very strong, spicy flavor and aftertaste, you can tell there's Asafoetida (sort of a gum resin, used as a digestive aid, popular in Indian pickles and often substituted for onions and garlic in cooking by some as a religious preference). Has a bit of sauce with the vegetables which for me is great. A little can go along way and it's a great condiment for rice and some Indian meals. I've eaten this out of the jar by the spoonful, it's one of those tastes one can aquire and find hard to shake.<br /><br />This is advertised as a pack of 8. I noticed that it was delivered in a 9-pack with one missing. The quantity delivered is right, just made me do a double take and grin, thinking of a shopkeeper putting individual jars on his shelves when he could have charged me a bit more for the entire pack and saved himself the hassle of opening all those flats to pull one out of each.

And you can make your own brown sugar by mixing a teaspoon into a half cup of white sugar.)<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this product five stars is because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the packaging doesn't hold up well in shipping. One of our orders had to be returned because it leaked out of the package and into the courier's truck. Another order leaked but at least stayed within the Amazon box.<br /><br />Since it's molasses, I'm going to guess that such leaks occur more often in hot summer months.

I have just started using this supplement after workouts and it has taken me a bit to figure out a taste combo that I can live with. The milk-shake flavor may be a little bit overboard. I would probably like just a normal chocolate flavor. The recommendation is two scoops but I use one and I still feel the taste is quite strong. I mix one scope of this with 2 cups of almond breeze almond milk and sometimes some frozen strawberries - blend it in my blender and it is a great drink. It also provides enough chocolately flavor to cure any possible sweet tooth I might have.,Alright,4

Though the directions indicate you can use as much or little as you want, the recommended amount is a full squirt. For me that's far too much, even for a large glass or typical water bottle, so I suggest you add a little to your water at a time until you determine how much works.

"Our last cat spent his last few years with hardly any teeth (although he was 21) and thus could only eat wet canned food. So, when we adopted a new one we decided to take better care of his teeth from the start.  We feed him feline greenies daily as a treat and give him one of these chews a few times a week.  I suppose we could also brush his teeth but to me that seems like overkill (he is a cat after all).  Anyway, he absolutely loves these chews. He bats them around all the while biting them and after a short while the chew breaks apart and he wolfs it down with delight.  I cannot give this product 5 stars only because I cannot say what long term effect it is having on his teeth because he's only 2 so has good health all around.  I wasn't sure if he would like these treats as the common complaint in the other reviews seems to be that some cats just wont touch them.  However, since the treat is pretty similar to a wine cork I would suggest you see first if your cat will play with one (our cat loves batting corks all over the house).  I have a strong feeling if your cat likes to play (with corks especially) he or she will love these chews","Great idea, awesome treats!",4

"I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry.

However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack.",Yum.,4
"As I said in the title, the best part of this hair oil is the soft hair I get after using it.

As long as I don't use too much, this hair oil is great.",Makes my hair feel so soft!,4

"This gift is a wonderful accompaniment to any kitchen, especially for those who are health conscious and want to serve natural and organic foods at home.  The Braggs Liquid aminos is an excellent alternative to soy sauce (without all the extra salt) and have used it twice for the base of delicious marinades on seafood, along with garlic and ginger.  The Braggs organic seasoning is very tasty on mixed vegetables to kick them up a notch, or sprinkled on potatoes.  Just watch out with how much you are using if you have high blood pressure or are watching your sodium intake.  The quinoa was very fresh and nutty tasting, and I liked the fact that it is pre-washed, saving an arduous step in cooking quinoa.  Makes it a very easy and healthy side dish to include with any main dish.",Perfect gift for the natural & health minded cook,4

I grabbed this at a local pet store and am very happy that I did because my cat loves it.  When I tried giving him the chicken formula, he decided that he rather go hungry than eat it but this flavor, he gobbled right up.  I do have to mash it down a bit and mix in some water so that it has a gravy-like consistency that is more appetizing.  Once he's done, he just lays there contently licking his chops.  It makes me feel great knowing that I'm giving him something that is a healthier alternative to some other brands.<br /><br />ETA: I forgot to add in that the reason for the 4 star review is because of the consistency.

I don't plan on that happening again but am happy to know if it does I wont stink lol. If this is your normal brand try the Subscribe and Save and see if its a savings for you.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />Amazon raised the price of the deodorant and is not longer competitive with local stores.

The tea bags are made of a fine mesh and the leaves are large cut and release very little dust that can ruin the end of a cup. I prefer to drink my tea after steeping for 2-3 minutes (don't like it overly strong myself) and find I can usually get a decent second cup from 1 tea bag. It is one of my favorite peppermint teas though I have knocked off one star for the high price and the fact that the mesh tea bags occasionally rip if you're not careful when pulling the tag off.","Good flavor, big solid leaves",4

"This chocolate is only 54% cocoa solids. Given that many of the better bittersweet or dark chocolates have 65-80% cocoa solids, that gives a lot of room for other ingredients, which in this case is sugar.

"My family has two cats who are just over a year old.  We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor- little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.<br /><br /> I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge.",Looks almost like people food!,4
"I can taste artificial sweeteners from across the street.  Hate the stuff.  In a restaurant I sent a Coke back three times because they kept bringing me Diet, assuring me it was the real thing.

This doesn't even get into the fact that aspertame isn't fit for human consumption.<br /><br />Enter Xylitol.  I bought a box of packets to use at the office where I drink coffee.  I find I need two Xylitol packs to replace one sugar.  No matter.  It tastes fine.  I detect no aftertaste.  And it's actually good for my teeth and blood sugar level.  This is something I can like!<br /><br />My only complaint was the shipping packaging.  The box of packets was stuffed into an envelope which, of course, arrived flattened.

"I have been buying bars from KIND for a few months, and I decided to see how they do shipped from Amazon rather than buying from the store.  I love the Dark Chocolate, Nuts, and Sea Salt variety as well as many of the others.  The bars buy themselves are worth 5 stars for taste and healthy diet considerations.  While they have a high ratio of fat, the fat from nuts is beneficial in reasonable amounts.<br /><br />So if everything is so great, you might be wondering why I only gave them 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the product is somewhat degraded in the delivery process.  I'm not sure what time the Post Office left them in my mailbox, but the Texas sun was not kind (no pun intended) to them while they waited for me to get home and retrieve them.  The dark chocolate wound up melting to an extent.  Even after waiting for it to solidify the next day, the melted chocolate that adhered to the wrapper went everywhere when I opened the bars.  It did not affect the taste any, but this is not a problem that I encounter when I buy them in the store and bring them straight home.  This is not an issue for the non-chocolate varieties, but I cannot recommend buying any of the bars from KIND in the summer.",Great Product - Just Not As Great Shipped In The Summer,4

"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.","Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor",4

"This tea smells and tastes like tea that has a lemon slice put into it. The pyramidal design lets the leaves expand and float freely inside the bag, allowing for more of the tea flavor to diffuse. The downside is that the bag is made of nylon or some kind of plastic mesh, making it non-biodegradable. The pyramids are also just boxed together, not individually sealed for freshness.<br /><br />The black tea taste does seem weaker than the traditional flat Lipton tea bags. Maybe I've had the box open for too long (but it's well before the Best Before date of 10/24/11), or it's being masked by the lemon juice concentrate and marigold petals. For iced tea (with honey), however, I can't really complain about the taste.

"I have three (3) cats that use to all eat Purina One brand cat food.  After reading up on the topic extensively I have found out that most cat foods use grain fillers as primary ingredients and that cats do not normally eat that type of product.  These grain fillers can have negative effects on cats such as obesity, diabetes, allergies (much like gluten allergies in humans) and other issues that can significantly shorten a cat's life or make for very often and expensive vet visits.  I decided to switch to EVO Turkey & Chicken after reviewing all the different brands of all-natural cat foods.  This diet is essentially like the Paleo-diet for humans in that the main ingredients are meat.<br />So far my cats have been on this diet for about three (3) months and I have noticed increased energy, brighter eyes and coats, and more playfulness.  I have even got away from giving traditional treats in favor of wet grain-free food.  My cats have loved it as a treat a few times a week and it gives them additional nutrients that some experts say dry food is lacking in.<br />The only bad thing about this food is that it is kinda crubly and does end up getting on the floor when the cats eat it.  Just make sure to clean this residue and crums up so you do not get ants or other bugs.",Very good cat food just makes for a lot of crumbs,4

"After listening to the commercials I bit and bought the 5 Hour Energy drink. I tried it out just last week. Believe me, this is powerful stuff. It's not just the caffeine that has an effect on you. There are other ingredients that also alter the chemistry of the brain.<br /><br />We've mentioned caffeine. Big deal. You drink a cup of coffee and you'll get the equivalent amount, which is about 100 mg. Compared to a lot of energy drinks that's relatively mild. 5 Hour Energy makes a decaffeinated energy drink too, so we have to assume that the real effects don't rely on the caffeine. And it's about time. All caffeine really does is substitute one state of poor concentration (sleepy) with another (jittery). Other ingredients help to increase concentration and some even act as mood stabilizers. Still others are nutrients and vitamins.<br /><br />But that's theory. The real world effects are another story. I tried 5 Hour Energy after a sleepless night. After taking just one shot, which is really the maximum recommended dose, I felt awake, alert and ready to face the day. BUT as the day went on there were other effects. I noticed that my concentration was improved using this drug even more so than with Adderall. (So if you're ADD like me, you could possibly self-medicate with 5 Hour Energy. Just make sure none of this gets out to Big Pharma.)<br /><br />Unfortunately it had some unwelcome effects. I felt as if there was a dynamo spinning constantly in my head. My thoughts started to race. I was worried, briefly, but convinced myself that the sensation would go away, and it did after just 15-30 minutes.<br /><br />I now think that 1/2 to 2/3 of a bottle may be the best dose for me. I'm not a fan of inebriation, but I could clearly identify a brief ""high"" and a slow letdown period that has surely gotten plenty of twentysomethings addicted to this drug.<br /><br />My advice? Use it wisely. Don't underestimate it because it's small. Whatever you do, don't drink more than one in a 3 hour period or two in a day - so says the label, probably for good reason. And get your sleep if you can. Energy drinks aren't an excuse to not sleep.<br /><br />And again, let me be clear. This is a drug!",Has a powerful effect on the brain.,4

"Never try this brand before but saw it has a good review so just give it a try.<br /><br />Pro: Very tasty. I order the pepper flavor and it is one of the best beef jerky I ever tried.<br /><br />Con: It is not tender enough. If your tooth are not strong enough, you need to take great effort to bite. Actually there is a way to tear it before you bite and make it easy. But I guess most people still prefer more tender.<br /><br />Bottom line: the hardness is still acceptable and it is very tasty. The quality price ratio is pretty high. Recommend!",Tasty!! Need more tender,4

"I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.","High quality, organic!, a little flat",4
"I got one K-Cup of Wolfgang Puck's Colombian Reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35-pack that I bought here on Amazon. Since I'd always assumed that I preferred the less-burnt flavor of a light or medium roast, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue. It is sweet, full, and gently bitter. I brewed it in a 9.25 oz. cup in an effort to dilute it a little, but I may be gutsy enough to try a 7.25 oz. cup the next time around.","Great, considering I usually prefer a light/medium roast",4

Just two hours after eating them I definitely had to break into my lunch stash or find another snack, though ignoring that they were all around good, definitely get some.",Tasty though not fulfilling,4
I ordered the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew bars and I was pleasantly surprised how good they tasted. My husband likes them and so does my daughter. The only thing is I wished they had a little less sugar. The nutritional facts say they have 14g of sugar.

Ok, so we got it and tried it and it really was much better than I expected. More of the peach flavor comes through than the mango. My teenager really liked it. I like buying kool aid like this as you can make as much or as little as you want right from the container to the glass.",Surprised,4
"I purchased this product on Amazon.com based on some of the positive reviews. It was well worth it! I like pumpkin spiced coffees or lattes in the fall, but don't like paying the coffeehouse prices. And frankly, I was tired of the inconsistent flavoring added to my orders -- some would be bitterly spicy or have little pumpkin flavor at all.<br /><br />The Amoretti Premium Syrup solved those problems. By following the instructions for adding to coffee *exactly as written on the bottle*, my coffee beverages taste great. [This was noted in several of the reviews here, which was very helpful.)<br /><br />This is a quality syrup, and the free pump that comes with it is very convenient.",Delicious addition to coffee,4

I usually drink it when I need that caffeine pick-me-up, not when I want a flavorful tea experience. For that go green.",Not so bad,4

We started using this product after we learned that Organic Similac contained sugar and was in the process of being banned in the EU. I believe that this product uses lactose as the sugar needed to break down the milk-based protein. We knew that we wanted an organic milk-based product to supplement breast feeding when necessary and this one seemed to have the best ingredients. So far our babies seem to tolerate it quite well. No excessive gas or allergies that we can tell after about 8 weeks of using this brand. Also the color is more like my milk and it doesn't stain or have an off-putting smell like other formulas we've seen.,"So far, so good",4

"Traverse Bay dried cherries are absolutely fabulous. Bought them for my Dad to help with his gout: within a week or so he was out of the slipper and back in normal shoes. Big Pharma gout meds can make the gout worse while your body deals with the sharp uric crystals freed by the meds. If you want or need the meds, take them, but do try cherries also!  Any form, apparently, is helpful: fresh, dried, even the nasty red dyed ones in jars; cherry juice.  The cherries have eased my daughter's achey joints due to Lyme.<br />HOWever, do keep an eye on the price!!  They went from $23 to $28 to $43 to $20 in the space of days. I fnally shelled out the $43 cos my family were out, and I figured that the supplies were seasonally low. Plus, Amazon exhorted me to ""BUY NOW! Only 6 boxes left in stock"".  So I did and in less than 2 days they went from $43 to TWENTY DOLLARS. Must say I was miffed. I'd have cancelled the unshipped order but was away from 'net for a crucial day.....<br />Some folks have said the odd batch can taste oily or perhaps stale.

"This is the first treat I've gotten that says it is for both cats and dogs, so I was a little skeptical at first that my cat, Lily, would like it. She's 15 years old and has become very finicky about what she eats. She now turns up her nose at our Purina dry food, which used to be her favorite. I've been feeding her cans of salmon and gravy (Fancy Feast) but even with that she leaves a lot of leftover salmon pieces in the bowl (!)<br /><br />Discouraged, I had nothing to lose and decided to give her half of a Raw Boost treat to see if she'd like it. The box says you should give your cat only one or 2 treats per 20lbs of the cat's weight. Well, my Lily is a tiny cat and weighs only 5 lbs or so, so imagine my dilemma. Taking the treat out of the package, I was amused at how much the treat resembles a peanut butter cookie. It's soft, however, and easy to tear in half. It feels crumby like a cookie, however, so I decided to break it down into little ""crumbs"" for Lily to eat. She has problems with digestion and throws up more than the typical cat, so I'm always careful to chop up her food into small, bite-sized pieces.<br /><br />Imagine my relief that Lily loves it! She licked her dish clean and begged for more. I'm going to make a note to buy more.","My Finicky, Older Cat Licks the Bowl Clean When I Give Her This",4

I will be ordering these in bulk. Been on a gluten free kick lately after reading up on the horrors of gluten on blood sugar. You'll have to do your own research, but it's shocking, thinking you've been eating healthy wheat, only to realize that for some wheat can be the cause to many progressing health problems.

And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats.

"I am a lap-band patient and was having a very hard time finding a protein shake that I actually could stomach, but this one is the winner.  I use fat-free milk, and some vanilla almond milk to mix mine up.  Its quick, tasty, and gives a nice jolt with the espresso already in the mix!  I have yet to try it hot, but for quick and easy cold mixing I highly recommend one of those blender bottles.  I also like their new flavor: vanilla latte.",Tasty Protein!,4
"This is a fine (though perhaps not spectacular) tea.  I found the flavors--both the tea flavor and the fruit flavors--to be a little on the mild side for my taste, even when seeping the tea for significantly longer than the instructions recommend.

"Okay, so most of the kashi items are, in my opinion, hard to compare to other mainstream less healthy options, these however, have almost the exact same texture as the nature valley granola bars. They are definitely crunchy and a bit messy. I actually, for ease of eating purposes, whack my still wrapped/sealed bars against the counter so that the individual pack breaks into smaller/bite size pieces. This makes it easier to eat these, because biting into the bars is a little challenging (yes, they are THAT crunchy!) That being said, the flavor of these bars is quite satisfying and delicious. I find these especially tasty dipped in a bit of honey, almond or peanut butter. I would note however, the extreme crunchiness of these bars may not be conducive to someone who has a hard time chewing, and/or beware, as the grains/seeds have a tendency (not unlike popcorn hulls) to stick in teeth, maybe not great for anyone with dentures/braces. Another important note, Kashi, being wholesome/natural, does not last/have as long of a shelf life as mainstream chemical/sugar laden bars, so when buying these in bulk, be CERTAIN that you will be able to make it through multiple boxes within a fairly short time frame...I think I generally see expiration dates that fall within about 2 to 3 months of purchase on kashi items. All in all though, these are definitely a good overall snack, that you can feel okay about enjoying, and pretty tasty as well.","These are tasty, but a little tough on teeth!",4

"I don't drink coffee every day, more like once or twice a week, and when I do I prefer a mild cup of coffee. I like good flavor but not too bold, and not bitter. Basically, I would opt for a Dunkin before a Starbucks, just to give you an idea of what I normally drink as I review Marley One Love Coffee.<br /><br />The box contains 15 single serving pods, individually sealed in foil. Each pod contains about 1/3 of an ounce of coffee. They are very convenient for storage or taking on the road. The cardboard box has a cutout near the bottom to easily dispense the pods (or you can just open the box from the top). The coffee is advertised as ""100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.""<br /><br />I typically make my coffee in a Keurig or a standard coffee maker/filter. I tried One Love four ways, ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS THE RECOMMENDED USE, as the coffee is advertised as ""for use only in single serve home coffee pod brewers"". Why did I order this coffee without said pod brewer? When I travel I find more and more hotels have pod brewers, so I am interested in a good coffee to use on the road. Anyway, I made the coffee:<br /><br />1) In a single serve brewer, a Black and Decker Brew N Go,<br />2) By filling a Keurig reusable K-Cup/filter.<br />2) In my standard coffee maker, a Braun, using the pods in the same amount/weight as I would any loose coffee.<br />3) Steeping a pod in a coffee mug, approximately 7 1/2 ounces in size.<br /><br />Unlike many coffees, where I think ""Wow that smells really good"", only to be disappointed by the flavor, Marley One Love hit me just the opposite. When I smelled the unused pod, as well as the brewing coffee, I thought ""Hmmm, that doesn't smell too great."" But wow, the result is a really nice cup of coffee. One Love is not at all bitter, and I wouldn't even call it bold. It is mild to medium in taste, while not being weak at all. I found I got the best results using it in the Keuring or regular coffee makers. Steeping it was OK, but it was somewhat weaker that way.<br /><br />I would get this coffee again, either loose in the bag or in pods.",Nice Cup Of Coffee In A Convenient Pack!,4

"I received my bag of Kind Healthy Grains clusters free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />We eat cereal for breakfast a couple of times per week, and I'm always looking for one the kids like that isn't half sugar and artificial colors. I was really impressed with the ingredients in this product -  Non-GMO flax seeds, amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat.  No artificial ingredients, preservatives or coloring, and it's sweetened with evaporated cane juice and molasses, and not the dreaded HFCS.  It's high in anti-oxidants, Omega-3s, and fiber, and is low in salt and fat. Best of all, it contains actual blueberry puree - very few of the foods sold as ""blueberry"" actually have any in it!<br /><br />Overall it's a very good choice for snacking or as cereal.  They need to put it in a box or some other container because my bag arrived with all the clusters broken into small pieces.  There was no way to eat this except as cereal with milk, or sprinkled on food (we had some on yogurt).  It tastes really good, with complex flavors from the various grains.

"I received this item originally short in qty/weight by 13%. Although I emailed the seller (per Amazon's suggested procedure) they did not contact me after a week so I left a negative review. They did proceed to ship me greater than the short quantity at no-charge to correct the shortage and finally contacted me by both phone and email requesting I remove the original negative review. While I wish they would have contacted me in the first place, I have removed the original review and am replacing it with this one. Although I ended up with more than I ordered, I don't feel it is fair to give a 5 star rating (I feel this is a 3-1/2-star transaction). I firmly believe that had the seller weighed the original shipment accurately and replied to my email in the first place to sort out the shortage I would not have had to leave a negative review originally and would have saved us both a lot of hassle and time.

"Just as the title of my review says, these Newton Fruit Thins in the Blueberry Brown Sugar flavor taste just like crunchy blueberry muffins. The blueberry flavor is distinct but not overpowering. The brown sugar is subtle; the cookie isn't too sweet (I personally would prefer it sweeter, but my husband and younger son thought it was perfect as is!). The cookie is chewy where the blueberry pieces are, so that's either good or weird depending on your personal inclinations.<br /><br />These cookies are lower in sugar and fat than many cookies, so they're a healthful alternative to the typical sugar bombs. Should be pleasing to blueberry lovers of all ages! They make for a nice treat. My son has already asked for them in his lunch tomorrow!<br /><br />Not sure about the price here, though. Seems kinda high and worth doing a local price comparison (just as I did on the Nabisco fudge mint Oreos, which were considerably cheaper locally).",tastes like a crunchy blueberry muffin,4
I had some of the Green Mountain coffee and it was very acidic and way too strong so I wanted something with more flavor and I bought this one. I think it is a great coffee flavor.

"This coffee has a really strong roasted/burnt flavor to it. If you like typical non-gourmet morning coffee then you will like this; however, I have traveled down south, to countries like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, etc. and have tasted fresh roasted REAL coffee direct from the trees at the farm the very next day after a harvest. I prefer my coffee black, as-is, in other words I like to drink and taste my coffee rather than pour in a bunch of other crazy flavors.<br /><br />Real coffee roasted properly is fairly smooth anyway, with a strong taste of coffee bean and a hint of smoke, it is very pleasing. This coffee is more like bitter burnt charcoal, but here in the USA we tend to drink coffee to stay awake so this coffee does have it's purpose, the burnt bitter taste slapped my eyes wide-open from the very first sip so I stay lively at work with a spring in my step all day, but not to any extreme, for example, 4 cups in 10 minutes didn't give me the caffeine jitters. I'll have to look for something a little smoother to drink at home though or I'll never want to sleep at night.<br /><br />If you like green bean fresh roasted, gourmet, or exotic coffees stay away, this is not for you. If you like to fill your glass with milk and sugar, then give this a try, you'll have to pour in twice as much flavor filled fat and sugar to cover up the powerful taste of this stuff. If you sip coffee at work to stay awake this is a excellent choice because it is at least 2 times stronger than Folder's or Maxwell's dark roasts.",Really strong stuff...,4

Nevertheless the product lives up to its claims quite well.<br /><br />The item did leak quite a bit in transit as some other reviewers have stated. But that does not reflect upon the quality of the product just the shipping department so I just ignored that in my rating. What would make this a 5 star product?

It encourages me to eat more fruit, and I'm starting to blend in a few veggies too and you can't get enough of those!

"I bought Kitty's Garden after I first discovered my cat trying to nibble on all the fake plants in my home.  I had to spray those with bitter apple just to get him to stop.  I was a bit skeptical about buying the pre-grown pots of grass from the pet store, because I bought those in the past for my gerbils and they wilted quickly after purchase.  I do not have a ""green thumb"" in any way, shape or form (hence all the fake plants in my place), but decided to buy this one because it boasted a nice variety of organic grasses for my spoiled cat and the wood container was adorable.<br /><br />I found this kit very easy to use.  So easy, in fact, that I started my garden in my office and left it on the window ledge there for the first week.  Of the four grains offered, I found that the barley one didn't thrive in my kit.  A bit of sparse grass grew from that compartment, but overall barley was a disappointment.  However, I still highly recommend this kit to any other pet owner that needs some grass for their four-legged ""pet-kid"".","Very easy to grow, my cat enjoys nibbling on it",4
"I LOVE cooking with new flavors, and pride myself on being an adventurous cook.  I don't do beef much (a few times a year), but happened to have some primo beef that was perfect for this.<br /><br />I seared my beef in a cast iron skillet on all sides, then cooked partway through.<br /><br />I mixed the coconut powder, water, and oil in a Pyrex measuring cup, and added it to the pan, then added the paste.  It blended together perfectly!  No lumps or issues.  *BUT, I am not a fan of the dehydrated vegetable pieces--those were a distraction and we picked them out in the end.*<br /><br />I cooked the meat through with the lid on, at a med-low heat, stirring every few minutes, and turning the beef.<br /><br />To go with it, I made a mixture of different colors of quinoa and a side of lightly sauteed asparagus with garlic.<br /><br />The beef took on the color of the sauce (all the way through the meat).  I found this interesting.<br /><br />The flavor, I thought, was VERY good, especially with the quinoa.  I actually could have just eaten it with the vegetables and quinoa, and opted out of the beef altogether.  My guest, on the other hand, found it spicy (hot-spicy) and although he liked the flavor of the dish, said he would not order it for himself due to how his particular tastebuds perceived that hot-ness.  My mother and her husband would have found it altogether inedible, because they cannot handle any ""spice"" in their foods.  Just an FYI, in case you have sensitive people to feed.<br /><br />It made a LOT of food.  We two adults ate about 1/3 of the dish.<br /><br />I personally would order this for me, but since he can't enjoy it, it puts a damper on my recommendation.

In drinking the mixture with honey, it still has a mild pungent quality but is not hard to swallow like vinegar alone.

the idea of a chip alternative may be unconstitutional to some. but not when you have something like a bag of pop chips!<br /><br />they have lots of flavor and lots of crunch. they hold their own next to a sandwich. if you eat them too fast the array of spices can get in your nose and make you sneeze. so sit back and enjoy each bite!,a light flavorful alternative for a chip,4
I have about 10 -12 dogs under 20 lbs at any given time. This assortment is great for them. I agree that it can be pretty random but they seem happy with anything they get from the bag so I dont worry too much about that.<br />I wanted treats that didnt come from China and these dont. I like that they are made in the USA.<br />I usually order multiple bags at a time and they arrive quickly...and get eaten pretty quickly too.<br />Still a good value.,These are a big hit at my rescue!,4

"I just bought the cola flavor from Amazon and it tastes pretty good. It is different from regular coke, but not so different that I won't drink it again.  What I like about this is I get a healthier option for soda without the bad aftertaste of diet soda.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because nothing will ever beat regular Coca-Cola when it comes to cola flavored soda. But I don't like all the sugar that's in Coke.<br />The only downside right now is the price.  You are paying roughly $1.13 a can, but if you don't guzzle the stuff then it won't matter.  I do plan to buy some of the other flavors.",Not bad for a soda,4
This product came in a timely manner & seems to be in perfect shape & at a great price. My only concern was that the seal didn't actually have to be even broken to open the container. It seems fine though & I am using it as usual w/ no problems. :),Hopefully seal was actually sealed?,4

"Price per K-cups get poor marks when assessing for ""value""; however, in terms of quality there is an earthiness and flavor profile that far exceeds any regular drip brew that I have experienced for home brewers (with an obvious exception for french press coffee).  What I sacrifice in terms of increased per K-Cup cost is made up for in terms of quality.  I enjoy Starbucks, regardless of their corporate profile.  Going to Starbucks is likely to result in a $4-5 dollar cup of coffee; where as I sit here now and for just about a buck I am enjoying a natural, black cup of Medium Roast Starbies...

"I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, ""No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors"". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.",Good snack,4

"I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)",Great Idea- My dog loves it.,4

"I think its sad when I read reviews and they give a product a bad rating because they don't like Maple flavor. Hopefully, you won't buy a Maple flavored product and give it a bad review because it said it was Maple flavored and it was. What a shame.<br />There is an extreme Maple flavor to this sauce but that is OK with me because I love the contrasting sweet Maple flavor combined with the smokey taste that comes with BBQ food. I found this BBQ sauce to be thin but that is just fine because I don't like thick BBQ sauces anyway. I am happy with the flavor and consistency but I do find the price to be very high but that comes with the territory when dealing with Natural/Xylitol products. Maybe as more people branch out to Xylitol they will drive the pricce down to reasonable levels. If it weren't for the price I would use this BBQ sauce all the time!",It's all relative.,4
"I found that Doublemint lasts longer than any ""long lasting"" gum.  It's also the best tasting.  Part of that reason is that it uses natural sugar as the sweetener.

"Great tasting garlic oil.  The label in the bottle indicates it's a blend of canola, soybean, and olive oils.  My preference is to have a healthier/higher dosage of monounsaturated fat as this is found in both olive and canola oils.  Since the label indicates more polyunsaturated fat than monounsaturated fat, there must be more soybean oil in the content than the other two oils.  In any case, both types of unsaturated fats are better for you than saturated fats, so this garlic oil is good to use for all dishes!",Tasty Garlic Oil!!,4

"After falling in love with Kona coffee while in Hawaii we tried finding some back on the East Coast that wouldn't break our wallets like the 100% Kona would.

"To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor.",Great on a cut...value not so much,4
"These are good! Each roll is only 45 calories with 2g of sugars. They are similar in consistency to a rice cake, but slightly firmer due to the rice syrup. I think they taste sweeter than the 2g of sugars they contain, but not so sweet that you'd consider them candy or junk. They come packaged 8 rolls to a box. Because they're not individually wrapped, they can stick to one another in the package (although not to the extent that they're destroyed). Also, because there is no wrapper, although they are a decent snack for kids, they tend to leave little hands sticky. This order was for a dozen boxes. These are certainly good enough to order more than once, but I imagine it will take some time to get through the initial order. A 6-box option might be better.",Tasty!,4
"I tried a little bit before handing it over to the baby (20 months old), and I was surprised at how tart it was.  The first ingredient is pear, so I expected it to be a little bit sweeter.  But, the little guy didn't even seem to notice.<br /><br />Not sure if it is the novelty of eating from a pouch, or if he didn't notice the tartness, but it was gone in under 2 minutes.<br /><br />I like the pouches as they are easy for babies to self-feed (less messy!) and good for times when we are out.<br /><br />The current price (at nearly $2/pouch on S&S) is a bit high for my budget.  I've compared to the varieties at the store, and they tend to be cheaper, even for the organic ones.<br /><br />However, I felt good knowing that there were no ""funny"" ingredients in these pouches.  I would certainly recommend them.",Well-liked at our house,4
"I was quite excited when I found these.  Organic, made of real fruit instead of sugar and high fructose corn syrup, and cheaper than the Fruitabu rolls that my girls had been eating.

The milky-type beverages are really not my favorite way to drink coffee...I am more of a black coffee/espresso drinker, but these are a nice change.

"Vine is such a great innovation to get one to try or discover things they otherwise would most likely never become acquainted with.<br /><br />This is very good coffee, but the fact that it is one of the packet varieties leaves the necessity to have one of the brewers designed for such in order to obtain the correct results. I found a really inexpensive Mr. Coffee here for under $20 that I can ""always"" use to keep on hand in my seldom used cupboard above my fridge so it is available but out of the way. In lieu of this solution, I would suggest perhaps a french press setup that one could really squeeze the packet in order to get the full benefit of the ingredient....which, by the way, is an excellent Ethiopian yirgacheffe, totally organic (yeah), and of medium strength....just right (for me at least) on those yellow-sunshiny-mornings that seem to be quite frequent here in my area of the country of late.

"When my grandfater passed away a little over a year ago, I took over his horse boarding operation. In his last few years, he had several people ""helping"" him with things around the farm - including fence building & repair. What I found, unfortunately, was an absolute mess.<br /><br />Before reviewing this charger, let me state that NO charger will work properly if your fence is in poor condition. My grandpa had a mix of wire, poly-tape, and poly-rope. His charger was connected to thin copper wire, and it was a ""continuous output"" charger, which should NOT be used with the polytape or rope. It will simply burn through them, which was happening a lot. A continuous output charger also does not allow some animals to ""release"" from the fence, so I was finding a lot of dead birds.<br /><br />In learning what I needed to fix the fence properly, I had a GREAT conversation with a technician at Fi-Shock. So big points to them on customer service. This guy knew what he was talking about, and gave me some fantastic advice on the wire I needed and the proper charger to use. I replaced the copper line that fed the fence with insulated, galvanized high-voltage line. I also replaced most of the poly-rope with tape. Initially I had an older intermittant charger, but found that the insulator was burned out and it was running in a ""continuous"" mode, too. That charger was putting out a full 4,000v and felt like a snake bite, but it actually caused a section of my fence to catch on fire!<br /><br />I purchased the Fi-Shock SS-550X charger through Amazon for a great price, compared to the MSRP. The other chargers we had were Fi-Shock and had held up well. Plus I appreciated their customer support and the information on their web site. Hooking up the charger was easy. I really like the green and red connector screws because they are easy to identify, and easy to use with gloves on. The charger also has a light which is easy to spot and which flashes to indicate the intermittant function.<br /><br />I have now had this charger in use for a couple of months, and it seems to be working pretty well. My only concern is that for @8 acres of fence, I'm only testing out at about 2 lights (2,000v) on my tester. Per the manual, that's the expected number I should see. The charger is rated for ""1.2 KV +/- 20% open circuit voltage"" output to cover 15 acres, so it seems to be putting out the expected charge. It seems to be turning the horses for now, but I have NOT yet touched it yet (thankfully) to see how it feels. We just had an ice storm, and the SS-550X has hummed away while the fence was coated in ice - definitely a good thing! But for the keeping of four horses on 5 acres, I would like to have seen this charger be a little stronger (around 3k volts). When I would unhook my old charger, I'd get a little spark and the horses would jump. I liked that! They do not seem to register this one as much. I have my charger connected to two grounding rods to ensure I have a good ground.<br /><br />That said, my only real complaint - and the reason I have removed one star from my rating - is that recently the charger STOPPED working. Initially I could not figure out why. I checked the fuses, checked the fence, and checked the power source, but could not figure out the issue. Eventually I decided to just replace BOTH fuses (1/16 amp time-delay) with the extras from the package, which resulted in the charger working again. We had not had any storms in the area, so I can't imagine what might have caused the fuse(s) to burn out. Oddly, NEITHER one looks to be blown, so I could not tell on visual inspection which one was bad. So it was a little disconcerting to see that my fence could go down all the way without some failsafe. I understand that the fuses are there to protect the charger in the event of a surge, but SOME indication they were blow - such as a failure light, a beep, or having the charger light turn red or something - would have helped tremendously. Fortunately I had the extra fuses, so I was back up and running quickly. But I have NOT been able to find the ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPAK00"">Time Delay Fuse, 1/16 Amp</a>"" at my local farm supply stores. If you are ordering the charger online, I would advise ordering extras.<br /><br />One final note: As a word of caution, this charger is intended for the keeping of livestock - not children. While a charged fence putting out @1500 volts may indeed keep unwanted animals and people off your property, it should NOT be implemented to keep children ON your property (as noted by the other reviewer).

these are a little bigger than the standard mint - they're about the same size as an Altoid but shaped like ovals.  The flavor is really strong and chocolaty with a bitter chocolate aftertaste (rather pleasant if you like the aftertaste of dark or semi-dark chocolate.)<br /><br />the tin is a little clunky - a hinged-top tin - but is kinda cute in an old-fashioned sort of way.,strong flavor,4

"My wife and I agree that this is one of the better K-Cup coffee flavors. It's a tasty caramel flavor, which tastes natural and doesn't overpower the coffee. It also has a great aroma. The coffee isn't quite as delicious as say a Dunkin Donuts caramel latte, but the convenience of K-Cups means that we will be using this product in our house again and again.",Tasty flavored coffee,4
"When I first got this I tried a drip of it in a bowl of noodles, brought on a nice little sweat. Uped the anty for a few days until I arrived at 10 drips, which brings on a good sweat and a burning mouth, no worries about the burning, goes away in 10-20 minutes.<br /><br />You may be wondering why I say drips and not drops, and that is because the bottle is completely open, so good luck just getting a drop, maybe if your really careful with pouring it, me, I just drip it out. ;)<br /><br />All in all pretty good hot sauce to add some heat to whatever you like.","Hot, not the Hottest, but still Hot.",4
"This was a great bargain for the K-cups. It was less than half the store price, these funny cups use less plastic but still work in the machine and they were delivered very quickly. The coffee is a little stronger, I think since there is a filter bottom instead of just 1 hole so more coffee seeps out. I just run the machine cup-less for hot water and dilute it myself.",Good Deal,4
"Using it as intended with a single serve pod brewer, I found it to be weak but I liked the smell so much I wanted to find another way to try it.

I got a great tasting, strong cup of coffee (very strong, the kind my grandparents always used to say would ""put hair on your chest"").  I just ordered grounds because I really enjoyed the strength and taste of this coffee.  The pods weren't for me, but the coffee was.",Marley Coffee One Love,4
"I eat a good deal of brown rice because it is filling but it is also a tad boring.  It doesn't have much flavor.  This bullion provides a great way to flavor rice in a very simple way.  Simply place a half to full cube when cooking rice for a rice that is still filling but of a different flavor.  I like to pair my ""chicken"" flavored rice with sauteed greens and a vegetarian BBQ riblet (Moringstar Farms and Gardenburger sell a similar product).  I can't wait to try to make a vegetarian chicken noodle soup with this product.  The Edward & Sons website also has a lot of unique recipes so don't feel you would be limited to just soups or flavored pilafs.",great for flavoring rice,4
"Walden Farms Marshmallow Dip, an anomalous 'calorie-free' 'food' is interesting. Like others have noted, does not resemble marshmallow fluff in texture, and only slightly in taste perhaps. Its incredibly sweet to taste in itself, almost unbearably so. It's....meh... BUT, given its insignificant to no caloric profile, it actually makes a fantastic filler. I found that I could add my post-workout protein and creatine mixture to this stuff, with a small amount of fruit, and enjoy a pudding-esque concoction with calories being contributed solely from protein and miniscule amounts of fruit sugar. In this capacity, the stuff works wonders. Undoubtedly beats the alternative: water, protein, creatine. By itself? Perhaps not the best thing, but definitely a great way to experiment with other foods and still save on unneeded calories.",Thoughts on 'Marshmallow Dip',4
"I previously had purchased this as part of a pack with 4 flavors. I enjoy this one and the Kona blend the most. Though the Kona blend is my favorite, this is a good runner-up.

"If you're expecting something sweet, and almost syrupy like a slightly watered down version of coconut milk -- you're in for a shock.

They are still very delicious, but again it is missing something.  The crispy wafers are layered in chocolate with peanuts and carmel on top to make a great treat.

I could not taste the floral or exotic berry that the package promised but that did not matter to me.

"Lets be honest, I don't care about it being organic. Buy these things with subscribe and save through Amazon Mom (I am a dad, where is Amazon Dad, Amazon?). Anywho, all I care is that they don't pump these full of extra sugar/sweeteners which is not necessary since this stuff has naturally high levels of sugar anyway. I do like that it has veggies in it and carrot puree is on the ingredient list rather than just veggie juice. My daughter can down several packets in a row if I let her (18 months old).

"I did not like this coffee at first, because I didn't think it lived up to the smell it had in the bag. I could smell the vanilla, but somehow it didn't translate into the taste. I make my coffee the old fashioned way, with a percolator that I inherited from my grandfather. I like doing it that way, because it gives the whole house a nice coffee smell in the morning and this coffee didn't disappoint smell wise and it didn't really disappoint taste wise, it's just that it didn't quiet live up to the promise of being vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Yes there is a hint of vanilla and if I would have ordered this at Starbucks, I might not have ordered it a second time.

I came on amazon and looked this particular flavor up cause my local stores for some reason quit carrying it, and it one of my favorites.  Always loved caramel anything, and this cake mix makes a very tasty cake.  I will offer this advice to anyone who does buy it, Instead of oil as the box suggests, this cakes flavor really benefits if you replace the oil with a stick of margarine. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because Amazon is insane if they think i'm going to pay that much for a cake mix.",$15 for 6 boxes? Amazon is Insane!,4

"I love this bar--BUT bear in mind that I have to try hard to find a zero-sugar food that's easy to grab and throw in my purse.  If you're just looking for something yummy, this may not be your favorite.  But if you're looking for zero sugar, it's almost impossible to find, and when you do find it, it usually tastes bad.  In fact, there are some chocolate or chocolate/peanut butter versions of this same product, and I HATE them.  Gross.  But the white chocolate tastes great.  Caveat:  They are 230 calories per bar, which is too many calories for me, so I cut them in half and keep each half in a ziploc bag in my cupboard for a quick grab when I'm running out the door.

"This product was very easy to prepare.  One warning to those unfamiliar with GF 'dough'...it's more like a very thick muffin batter.<br /><br />While wheat flour has that stretchiness, this does not, simply because it's gluten-free.  I think if I had been more prepared for the consistency, it wouldn't have seemed so odd.<br /><br />That said, it was easy to mix (I did it by hand) and it did rise a bit during the waiting period.<br /><br />I added dried oregano and chopped fresh garlic to mine, and will add more seasonings next time I make it.<br /><br />Spreading the ""batter"" is not hard, if you are prepared.  I used a cookie sheet and made one rectangular pizza from one package.  Make sure you oil/spray the pan and you will need to spread the mixture using wet hands.  Again, since this is not wheat, you will be doing more spreading and patting down than stretching.<br /><br />You bake the crust first and then add toppings. I used jarred spag sauce, sliced mushrooms, sliced onions and shredded mozz cheese.  Baked it for about 18 minutes and it was perfect.<br /><br />This will not fool anyone into thinking this is a traditional wheat pizza dough.  There is no comparison, as wheat has totally different characteristics than these ingredients.  BUT, this product is great.  Really, it does not have much of any taste at all, and you can add whatever herbs and spices you want to the mixture to customize it.  The texture was slightly crunchy and even my husband loved it.<br /><br />Since this is my first GF mix, I have no other point of reference, so I can't give it 5 stars.  BUT, I will continue to use this product on a regular basis and I'm looking forward to trying the all-purpose flour I ordered at the same time.",First GF pizza I've had,4
"This is a very tasty soup indeed, and it makes a LOT- at least 6-8 hearty meals, made according to the directions, and more if one added corn or another vegetable to it (corn or lightly cooked onions would be good; it could also handle something like roasted poblano peppers).<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the expense. This is not at all a complete kit for this soup! You will need to add a pound of hot sausage, a whole chicken breast (boned and skinned), a large can of diced tomatoes, and 6 cups of chicken stock, in addition to whatever extra veg you might like.<br /><br />Still, once you've done this- it's delicious.<br /><br />Note that it's also not fast, at least in elapsed time. After soaking the chickpeas overnight, they simmer for 2 hours; then you saute the meats, add the rest of the stuff, and cook an additional 1.5-2 hours. This cooking time is hands-off, but it does require planning ahead.<br /><br />The result, though is really good. Definitely homemade-tasting; the seasonings are excellent; and the ease of making is wonderful.<br /><br />I used hot italian sausage since that's what I had, but I think the recommended chorizo would be even better. One could probably also skip the chicken and add some rice for a complete protein with the chickpeas.<br /><br />This- and many of their other kits- are gluten free- something that makes them attractive to me. While I'm not GF myself, many of my friends and family are, and these would make a nice casual dinner for them!<br /><br />And hey- even with what it costs- it's cheaper than fast food or a restaurant! and much more tasty.<br /><br />I do like these soup kits. I';ve tried several now, and they've all been yummy- though this is the best one so far.",Delicious and easy,4

She would get SO EXCITED when she'd hear me opening a pack of them! I also used them to get veggies and other nourishing foods in here when she was putting up a stink and wouldn't eat them. I'd wait for her to open her mouth for the Mum Mum, and then I'd stick a spoonfull of veggies in her mouth. She didn't seem to care because she was getting her Mum Mum! She's getting to smart for that trick now, but it worked for a while!

"If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: ""useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis.""

"We got one of these in large size for our Australian Cattle Dog mix, and he loves it.  We use it each night (sometimes in combo with other similar products) to feed him his dinner.  The cube can hold a full cup of kibble.  It's entertaining to watch him ""herd"" it all over the den and it keeps him busy while we prepare or eat our own supper.  I agree with the earlier comment about the settings being ""easy"" and ""slightly less easy.""  I wish it were a little more challenging, but it's still a great toy.",Good toy,5
"After becoming interested in matcha for cultural and health reasons, and doing a great deal of research with regard to both,  I bought a tin of Kama Matcha directly from Matcha Source.  Prior to purchasing, the owner returned a message I left for her, answering at length several questions I had.  She was well-informed, patient, and pleasant, which gave me confidence in purchasing from her company.  She helped me select the accouterments I needed, based upon my budget, and spent as much time on me as if I had been buying the store. I got a discount for my first order and free shipping.<br /><br />Anxious to try matcha of any sort, while I waited for my tin of Kama to arrive (which it did promptly) I purchased a tin from my local Oriental store.  They had two types and I bought the more expensive of the two, Maeda-En, which was $10 for 28g.  The color is very pale green and it tastes exactly what I would imagine pulverized grass clippings out of the lawn mower bag would taste like.  Very bitter, nasty and unpleasant.  I can mix it into smoothies and such, in which fruit and honey mask the flavor, and I will continue to use it for that. But the stuff is horrific and, to me, absolutely unpalatable on its own.<br /><br />So with this my first experience with matcha, I was pretty worried that when the Kama Matcha arrived I wasn't going to like it and that I had wasted the money on it.  But I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Mind you, I've only had these two types, but there is a WORLD of difference!  The Kama is very smooth, bright green, and not at all bitter.  It has a light, delicate flavor which, though definitely still reminiscent of ""grassy,"" is not unpleasant in any way.  I do prefer it with about a 1/4 tsp. each of raw sugar and milk, just to add to the creaminess, but it's good straight, too.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I have had absolutely no trouble with it staying lumpy after sifting and whisking.  I do sift it and mix it with a bamboo whisk, but I enjoy the ritual, and there are no lumps whatsoever.  When I tried whisking without sifting, I got a few tiny lumps but even then it was not at all unpleasant.  I can tell I have had a cup of it. The feeling is not one like you get from a cup of coffee.  It's a subtle sort of sense of alert well-being which actually surprised me.  I have a cup before work and a cup at lunch and I honestly feel that it has enhanced my performance and mood at work.  Add to that the incredible health benefits and I am definitely hooked!<br /><br />There's no denying this Kama Matcha is expensive, especially on my budget.  And I do intend to experiment with various brands, hoping to find an equivalent for less money.  The previous reviewer mentioned a brand $15 cheaper which they bought at their local health food store and thought was superior. I'd honestly love to know what it is.  Cheaper would be nice, but I have a hard time believing I could find a matcha I like better, as far as flavor, color, and texture go.  And, again, the customer service was superlative.<br /><br />I recommend you give this one a try!",Love this stuff!,5
"The key to choosing a successful wet food is obvious--knowing what your kitty likes. Over time I learned that my cats like non-chunky wet food. I tried the Weruva chicken flavor, which has grainy chicken pieces. They didn't hate it but didn't go crazy over it either. Then I tried the Polynesian BBQ which has a lot of chunks so that didn't work out either. Then I saw the picture of the Mediterranean Harvest and knew that would be the magic dish. And it was! My cats absolutely love this flavor! I am so happy I finally found something both of my cats love to eat everyday.",great for non-chunk lovers!,5
"I never drink flavored coffee, but this one is amazingly good.  I do love the combination of raspberry and chocolate in general, so I took the plunge.  This is delicious coffee.

Not for my morning brew, but a nice afternoon blend.","I never drink flavored coffee, but...",5

Thank goodness!!!!!  I loved it - I added nothing but assumed it would need salt, pepper, chicken, and veggies added to be good.  But this is great all on it's own. I went to put it away twice and each time had another cup.

I otherwise never eat potato chips because of the fat content, and will not suffer through eating 'baked' chips. I wish more products came with olean in them, I'd be on cloud nine.

Usually my go to source is coffee, but depending on the level of energy I need, several cups might be the answer. But that answer has me going to the bathroom more than I have time for. So I was pleasantly surprised when I drank a 5 Hour Energy instead. I had more than enough energy to make it all the way to bedtime! I never felt bogged down or sluggish at any point. & I had zero issues when it came to falling asleep. Not to mention not having to stop to use the bathroom every 30 minutes.

"Our cat was a stray that showed up at a friend's farm.  He was in very bad shape...very skinny, lethargic, and his fur was very wiry!  We got him on the mend with a visit to the vet and some antibiotics.  But it wasn't until we started feeding him Science Diet that we noticed the change in his fur.  It made such a vast difference!  He has the softest fur I have ever felt on a cat!  The Science Diet seems to help with the hairballs, too.  It is a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny to me.",Worth the money!,5
"My cat had the worst food allergies. The way she dealt with it was by vomiting on an almost daily basis. Getting special foods (i.e. Science Diet or Purina from the veterinarian) didn't help at all. Finally I tried Newman's Own dry food figuring it couldn't be any worse. It worked like a miracle! No more allergies and no more carpet cleaning except the occasional hairball. When my cat got older I started supplementing her dry food with the Newman's Own wet food and she loves it. She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce.

"I ordered the following Amy's Low Salt Products: Lentil Soup, Pea Soup, Minestrone Soup, and Medium Chili.  All of them are great.  If you are just now switching to Low salt or no salt you may find them to be bland until your body adjusts to the lowered salt intake (that could take months or up to a year).  The biggest complaint most have is the dented cans.  My Minestrone and Chili came in without any dents, the Pea Soup had 2 dented cans and the Lentils had dents in every can.  These dents are not caused by shipping.  All of my shipments came in with the packages totally intact with no signs that the outer shipping box had been roughed up in shipment.  These dents are caused by Amazon or Amy's warehousing.  The cans are not in boxes, they are shrink wrapped so when stacked the cans are actually bearing the weight.  Too much weight and the cans begin to buckle and this buckling will look like dents.  You can also get this same effect if the warehousemen are slamming the 12 pack cans down hard on top of each other.  This happens when workers in the warehouse get tired and become careless, are untrained, or just plain don't care about their job.  If you want to feel better then stay on a low salt diet, if you have ankle swelling then get on a low salt diet and get checked for congestive heart failure.  If you have high blood pressure get on a low salt diet and then increase your intake of magnesium.  Backing off your salt is not easy as it begins to change the way you taste food but if you stay with it and get off the high salt diet you will begin to taste food and not just the salt.  Have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the cook's salt intake is so high that the cook can't tell if he has too much salt in the food he is preparing?  I have more than once and it just destroys the meal.  Instead of buying 12 cans now try the Amy's Low Salt by getting it at your local health food store one can at a time then if you like order from Amazon and save.  Right now they have a 25% discount code when you order.  Write it down and use it as it saved me a few bucks.  Hope this review helps you.",AMY'S LOW SODIUM PEA SOUP,5

"I got this one special for my boyfriend as a surprise. Last time he got to pick out a matcha, we ended up with Cola, so this time I thought an alcoholic drink matcha was in order. More sophisticated? Well - more adult anyways ;)<br /><br />He is loving the flavoured matcha as much (if not more!) than I do! This one smelled sweet from the get go - creamy and .. tangy? Smoky? Not smoky! I'm trying to describe what irish cream smells like - it doesn't have the smokiness of whisky - but it definitely is sweet and creamy! I knew it was going to be a real treat - just like the real thing!<br /><br /> What a neat flavour experience! I prepared the matcha straight and thick for the first bowl. In this state I tasted mostly matcha with an aftertaste of sweet cream that lingered after finishing the bowl. It was very creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />Next I tried it over ice with 18% cream and sugar. I thought my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head and be lost forever! This was mine and Mike's favourite way to enjoy it. It's sweet, but because you have control over the amount of sugar, it's not crazy sweet and cloying. You could probably enjoy cup after cup with the only buzz coming from the energy of all that matcha you're drinking!<br /><br />This one is so so good mixed with the Madagascar Vanilla matcha - it just adds a bit of something that takes the creamy flavour over the top. Come St. Patricks day, it would be an awesome drink to mix with mint matcha (Mint is on the way in the mail as we speak!) and hey - it's already green!

"This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it.[...] Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website.  [...]) Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm197570.htm). In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.","Great for kids, perfect for travel, what's not to like?",5

Other mixes that I have tried tend to be flat tasting, sometimes grainy, and the texture seems crumbly.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  This mix is wonderful!

"We have a 12 year old Akita dog that has developed food-related allergies and intolerance as she has gotten older. Akitas as a breed are also more sensitive to chemicals. For this reason, we're very selective about what dog food and dog treats we buy. Wet Noses is one of the few dog treat lines which meets all our requirements, and our dog LOVES these treats! Wet Noses uses all organic ingredients and stays away from ingredients such as corn, wheat and soy to which dogs are more likely to be allergic. Every ingredient appears to have been selected to give exceptional nutrition for the money and for the calories it provides. We bought the sweet potato treat, a flavor dogs seem to love but which is rarely found in commercial dog food. (Before we found this line of dog treats, we used to add pieces of sweet potato to our dog's regular commercial dog food.) We were also impressed that Wet Noses uses quality ingredients such as rye flour, turmeric, sesame paste, cumin and cinnamon. All of these ingredients appear to have been included not only to make these treats taste good, but also for their health benefits. I would highly recommend this product. The treats are a little over an inch in diameter.","All natural ingredients, great taste",5

"Although I have not bought canidae through Amazon (there is a local store near me that carries the life all stages 40LB bag for $35) I just wanted to write in and remark how impressed I am with this food.  I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba, which he stayed on with me at 1st.  After talking to a friend who breeds world class vizlas, she told me how she feeds them Canidae and how wonderful it is.  I switched over to Canidae then thank god and ever since.  My chocalate lab people actually think is a black lab.  He is the darkest chocolate lab u have ever seen, his coat is so beautiful and glossy, when he was on the eukanuba it was light brown and discolored.  Coats can be a huge problem with choc labs, but canidae has solved that problem.  With all the problems with menu foods that include so called good foods like eukanuba, science diet, iams, etc, it is a relief i can trust canidae and not be worried about all that.

"The food this company makes is the closest I can find to raw until I actually get to feed mine raw more often. The value is amazing... actually because it is so dense with nutrients, my cats eat less and I spend less feeding them this brand of food than the other premium brands I was feeding them before.<br /><br />The canned is a dense pate style that needs to be mashed down. My cats had not been fond of pate textures of other brands of foods in the past. It took about 4 days for one of my cats to recognize it as her new food. She had to be enticed but it ends up she is loving it! (Patience pays off!) The other cat will eat anything and there was no problem getting her to eat it. The both now eat all 3 available flavors and seem to love the rabbit the best.<br /><br />Their coats are magnificent! Their stools are small and odorless, similar to what it would look like if they were on a raw diet. My oldest cat who had mild digestive issues doesn't have them anymore. Hooray! I also noticed that while on this brand of food, the crusty sleepies in their eyes are just about non-existent. I hardly have to groom their faces anymore. And they are so active I can hardly believe they have that much energy for their ages.<br /><br />I honestly believe that having no synthesized vitamins makes a world of difference. I had to go back to my old brand of kibble for a short time because I was waiting for my next Nature's Logic order to arrive. On their old brand the cats were producing so much extra waste and it wasn't nearly as healthy-looking. The difference really is amazing.<br /><br />There is no doubt to me the Nature's Logic foods are truly easy to digest and the nutrients are absorbed and used! I hope they continue to grow and the product becomes more well known and available.

"Two days after the envelope arrived, I have a quart ball jar about to overflow with active starter, and I'm ready to bake.<br /><br />When you place your order, buy some spring water and have a quart ball jar ready. When the starter comes in the mail, measure a couple of TB of spring water directly into the zip lock bag, and massage the very stiff mixture over several minutes into a loose batter. Squeeze the contents into your ball jar, stir in a couple of TB of flour, and set to rest with the lid loose enough to let expanding air out. Twice a day, double the weight of the jar contents, half and half flour and spring water by weight. Leave plenty of room for expansion; start tossing out half to make room once you've scaled up to your jar size. The provided instructions are simpler, and probably also work just fine.<br /><br />It is worth reading multiple sources (e.g. every book covering sourdough at a bookstore) for perspective. There's a school of thought that this sourdough starter is a visiting tribe of friendlies, to protect the wild yeast on your flour from unfriendlies as your own wild yeast (and its entourage; sourdough is complex) gets established. A month from now, there will only be your yeast. Know another source that dates to the Oregon Trail? Yeah, right. Just like trying to track down Mohito mint; mint is indeterminate, and all you can actually grow is YOUR mint. Mint adapts. Yeast adapts.<br /><br />Thus, any reliable starter is as good as any other, to bootstrap getting your own wild yeast going. This source is the real deal, as good as any, and a convenient Amazon one-click. No need to hesitate.<br /><br />This same school of thought holds that the source doesn't affect your sourdough flavor, once it is replaced by your local friendlies. Rather, the proportion (by weight) between flour and water, and the flours used, affect the response to proofing temperature and the flavor. It is important to train your starter with the same flours you'll be using to bake, perhaps along with some rye no matter what. I'm using freshly ground red wheat and rye, and 1:1 water to flour by weight.<br /><br />There are those who prefer spring water to distilled, as the minerals create a nice environment. Once a starter gets going, plenty of people just use tap water. In any case, the chlorine leaves standing water pretty quickly; one can simply plan ahead and set aside tap water, e.g. in a Brita.",Good stuff,5

"My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again.",Blotto cries for it!,5

"Whenever I drink a soda at home, it is always a Zevia soda.  Zevia has a refreshing cola flavor, while not being exactly like either of the big-brand diet colas.  I have noticed very little aftertaste from Zevia soda, much less than from regular diet soda.  From the reviews I've read, it's clear that you either really like this soda or you don't.  I really like this soda.  I was a big consumer of both big-brand diet colas for many years.  I really didn't like the artificial sweetener in the average diet soda.  Thank you to the people who make Zevia soda.  It is more expensive than regular soda, but I think it's worth it.  It is great to be able to enjoy a diet soda that tastes great and contains nothing artificial.  My only negative comment would be about what happens when you pour Zevia soda in a glass over ice.  The carbonation seems to dissipate very quickly when poured over ice.  Not to worry.  Drinking it right out of the can works fine for me.",The Best Alternative to Diet Sodas With Artificial Sweeteners,5

"My 13 year old Lhasa makes the title Prima Dona seem tame.  She is so finicky, we're at wits end.  I got tired of making her treats and needed something to bribe her with. What makes it harder is that she can't have salt due to her severely enlarged heart. We went to a doggy boutique and the lady ""knew"" that she had something she would like.  She tried EVERY treat she had and Michi just turned her nose up at everything!  The lady finally said, I'll bring out the big guns, and indeed, Michi loved the freeze dried chicken breast treats.  Unfortunately, I had to pay $12.95 for 2 oz. We were desperate so I paid it.  PureBites are a God-send!  Not only is the price more than reasonable, but Michi will do just about anything for them.  I recommend these highly for anyone with a finicky dog, especially one with heart problems, such as Michi.","Great product, Great Price",5

"I started adding these to my diet after reading about the paleo(caveman) diet and the anti-candida diet. I read these hempseeds control the sugar and carb cravings for those who follow those diets. Although I am not on the paleo diet or the anti-candida diet; I am eating mostly meats, fish, vegetables, fruits and nuts. These seeds are appetite filling and do control food cravings for sugars and starches.  Many times I will just eat a spoonful. I also add them to home-made smoothies and yogurt.

"I've lived in the states for 28 years and my mom has been faithfully sending me care packages which contained Caro Kaffee (Pero) among other goodies. I happened to see the container in a catalog and immediately went online to search for it. And here it is. I grew up on this stuff and gave it to my kids disguised as ""Kids Coffee"". My mom said that they used to roast their own during the war because real coffee was scarce. Anyway, it has a mild flavor somewhat like weak coffee. The powder form foams up a little, especially if the water is too hot. The crystals in the dark roast dissolve easier, but that's no big deal. So I stir a few more times. We add sugar and milk as with coffee and enjoy. It doesn't hit a nervous stomach as caffeine would. And no, it is not a superior coffee if that's what you're looking for because it isn't coffee. I can't wait to tell my mom that she no longer has to mail it to me. Enjoy.",Pero brings me back to Germany,5

"I have a confession to make: I eat baby food. I'm not a kid, and I'm not even a mother, so I can't make the excuse that I'm testing it to make sure it tastes okay for my baby. I'm a college student with no kids. It's just so easy! And baby food and dog food are so much healthier than adult human food most of the time (no, I don't eat dog food too!).<br /><br />These are the things I like about this particular item. It's super convenient with its little pouch that you can carry with you wherever you go and drink out of. It's mess-free. It's extremely healthy, with fruits, veggies, and chia seeds. It's also fairly low in sugar compared to a similar product I have also tried, the Peter Rabbit Organics pouches (11g compared to 12-23g). Plus it's cheaper.<br /><br />The only things I don't like about this product are the taste and texture, but if your baby doesn't know better, (s)he might not mind. The Peter Rabbit Organics brand has a better taste, although with twice the sugar in some varieties, it's not hard to imagine why. The texture of the chia seeds is also annoying, but I put up with it because a) I already paid for it and b) they have Omega 3s, which are very good for you.<br /><br />With subscribe & save, I paid about a dollar per pouch, which isn't too bad. It's not too filling for an adult, but when paired with a mini Clif bar, it makes a healthy snack for less than the Fillet O Fish I would otherwise get at McDonald's.",Very convenient,5

"I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called ""made here."" I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.<br />This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.<br />My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them. At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control, but now months on this food NO TARTAR. At all, and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time. His doggy breath has never been better. If I could give this food 10 stars, I would. I'd recommend this food for toy breeds as well as giant breeds.<br />It used to be when I opened a bag of food I'd keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky. Not this food, now, I'm not saying I want a mouthful, but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods. You can actually smell the herbs they use.<br />This product is on my wish list at Amazon.

"I pretty much agree with all the other reviews, and I am glad I read them before I tried to use this.  No, it isn't quite as smooth as Kraft mac and cheese powder, but it's still great for what it is.  I put it on steamed veggies, and it is just yummy. I may have to take a little extra time to break up a few little lumps, but honestly, I kind of like getting an extra strong taste of cheese powder with the occasional lump.<br /><br />I use it in a wild rice mix, and it is delish.  I found if you mix it in stuff, hot stuff, and let it sit a minute or two, it is sometimes easier to sort of smooth it out.  If you really HAVE to eat it lumpless, mix some ahead of time in broth or liquid by adding liquid a little at a time to the powder,and smooshing out the little tiny lumps.

"Absolutely! It is by far the nicest tasting granola I have ever had. It is not the same texture as most granola. It isn't extremely hard and crunchy. It is a bit softer in texture, but this doesn't mean that it sops up milk like a sponge if you choose to eat it more like a cereal. It remains the same lovely texture, not too hard, and definitely not mushy.<br /><br />As for its flavour, it's a bit nutty tasting. The cranberries in it are a splendid bit of tart-sweetness, and the sunflower seeds are gorgeous as well. I generally mix a bit of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola in with my Crispix. It's a scrummy touch to the Crispix, and makes the 12 ounce bag of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola last a lot longer. (I tend to have this for breakfast and at least one snack a day.)<br /><br />I give Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola five stars for its taste, texture, and nutrition.",The Most Delicious Granola You'll Ever Have,5

"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5

"The Izze sodas/fruit juices are quite good. They're a bit more expensive but put the standard fruit sodas to shame. They are, after all, 70% fruit juice and shouldn't even be compared to conventional fruit-flavored sodas. I've now tried two, the first was Blackberry and the present is Pomegranate. Personally, I like the Blackberry a slight bit better but the Pomegranate is outstanding. It's tart. I like than. No sickly-sweet sodas for me!

"Having read the comments about these not browning, I cooked my first batch with the oven rack raised (2nd-to-top rack), and after waiting and watching, eventually found the perfect browned/done effect after about 25-28** minutes at 350 degrees. I use a jumbo-sized muffin aluminum pan, which makes 6 large muffins.  My muffins are beautiful and they taste as good as they look, but not too sweet. I follow the instructions to the letter (including stirring, not mixing, the milk and muffin mix at the end), with one exception: I add 1/4 tsp. more vanilla than instructed (3/4 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. vanilla).  Then I've added 3/4 c. fresh blueberries to a few batches and 2 mashed ripe bananas to other batches.<br /><br />All of my batches have come out of the oven picture-perfectly raised to a gentle peak and golden-brown, not too dry on the bottom.  They are light and fluffy on the inside, buttery and slightly crispy on top.  Mine actually look better than the box (in my opinion, see photo); they rise a little higher than shown on the box.<br /><br />These muffins do tend to stick to the muffin paper unless you let them cool, initially.  When re-heating, I microwave them for 30 seconds and then remove the paper; I don't know why, but with this method the paper comes off very cleanly.  When either fresh out of the oven or chilled, the paper sticks; they need to be slightly warm to avoid the paper sticking too much.  Sometimes after microwaving and removing the paper, I will lightly toast it in the toaster oven to give the top a little crispiness.<br /><br />This mix seems to be very accommodating to alterations, as others have mentioned.  I am thrilled with this product and will buy it again.<br /><br />**I found I need to bake them a few minutes longer, up to 30 minutes, when using frozen berries rather than fresh berries, and 25 min. is sufficient when making these plain.  I have continued using the second-to-top rack because that works beautifully.","Yes, they do brown on top!",5

"Love all of Zatarain's products!

Okay, perhaps you won't be an overnight sensation but your culinary experiments are sure to take a step in the right direction thanks to these fantastic oils by La Tourangelle.<br /><br />Proper oils are essential for flavor, health and proper food preparation technique but our local grocery stores leaves a lot to be desired in terms of selection.

Both quickly became household favorites. The sesame has a slight sweet hint that my spouse finds perfect for apparently everything. He now uses it exclusively for organic popcorn (odd but it really tastes terrific) to salads and homemade bread. It's light with a slight sweetness. Absolutely delicious at a very competitive price.

"This is a great tasting Rendang with the flavors of the spices coming through. First some comments to earlier reviews. Usually the amount of lemon grass is more pronounced, with some chefs preferring to include a lot more pieces than this mix has in it. If you wish to cut the sweetness or have a stronger lemon bite, I suggest that you add some lemon juice.<br /><br />To add volume and vegetables to the dish without changing the flavor, I chunked up a can of whole bamboo shoots and cut a whole red bell pepper into chunks. This tasted great on a full plate of rice and made 6 large servings- creating an all-in-one dish and cost effective. If you want something crunchy, small pieces of celery would do fine. If you would prefer something soft, you can use a can of straw mushrooms.<br /><br />I prefer to cut vegetables into 1/3"" cubes and meat into 3/4"" strips so that every forkful has all the ingredients when the sauce is potent like this one.

"To be honest, I was at first skeptical about this drink.  In my mind, an energy drink had always been any drink with sugar and caffeine levels as high as seen in Monster and Redbull.  My mother one day brought this home from Costco and told me to try it out.<br /><br />It took me probably 2 or 3 drinks to get used to the taste. It wasn't that it was terrible. I guess the ""problem"" when I started out was that the taste was just a bit different from what I'm used to.  But I have to tell ya this company did a great job sweetening the drink without using sugar or some other artificial crap that's seen in others.  Once you get used to this drink you find yourself popping one out casually once a day.<br /><br />That being said I've noticed that this drink doesn't have the same type of boost you get with caffeine.  The problem with Red Bull and coffee is that the caffeine, while kicking in a lot faster than this drink, also causes you to crash and burn several hours later just as quickly.  This drink however doesn't have that effect.  It gives me a subtle yet noticeable boost for several hours before giving me a ""gentle landing"" back to where I usually would be without the drink.<br /><br />Anyhow, that's where I am.  Down to 5 tubes and hunting for any deals on this at Costco and here.",Great drink! Grows on you.,5

"I've tried so many different types of coffee from whole beans to instant.  I've traveled to the coffee plantations of Central America and that is the only place where I've tasted better coffee.  But in the United States and what you can buy in the store, and for the price, this coffee is the best tasting.  I could probably drink this Hazelnut flavor all day if it didn't stain my teeth and put more caffeine in me than my heart can handle.  The aroma is out of this world.  The taste by itself is a perfect 10.  Add some flavored creamer like Vanilla or something else in the creamer section and you got yourself a $5 cup of coffee for less than a $1.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I can't find this in the large size.  Maybe it is to prevent customers from going overboard on this coffee at one time lol.",Best Coffee You Can Buy for the Price Here or in the Store,5
"Great product if you're a cashew lover like me. No, these are not the colossal imported cashews that normally sell for $15 a pound. The description of this product says 'whole cashews', in fact only about 75% are whole the remainder are halves and pieces. For snacking or cooking they're great. Not too salty (sea salt). WELL worth the price, especially if you order on the subscription plan. I don't think you can find a better product at a lower price. These are factory sealed containers from 'Planter's', not repackaged from bulk.",Well Worth the Money,5

"I just finished my first serving of this salsa and was inspired to sit and write this review. This salsa is nicely hot and spicy thanks to the habanero and jalapeno peppers.  It also has good tomato flavor, not over-run by the heat.  It has no unnecessary sugars or sweet flavor, and is perfect for those of us who want a robust, spicy salsa.  Keep a cold drink nearby when you eat this salsa!!",Good & Spicy Hot,5

"I don't know how to explain it other than to say that it's like drinking a liquid mango.<br /><br />Having eaten fresh mango all my life and really NOT enjoying any flavor of Kool-Aid unless it was a desperate measure (I can tolerate Fruit Punch; everything else tastes like watery candy), I can safely say that this is Kool-Aid's best, most robust flavor.<br /><br />Why can't they mainstream this?  Grape Kool-Aid is just awful, as are most of the other flavors.  This flavor would sell like wildfire.  Let's start an email campaign!  Let's make mango a truly mainstream flavor next to cherry, strawberry, fruit punch and grape.<br /><br />Right now we have a handful of packets left, but if we ever ran out and couldn't find any at our regular store, this sounds like an o.k. deal (much more than we usually pay, but it's worth it!).","DEAR LORD, THIS STUFF IS THE BEST.",5

"I am not a big tea drinker and usually think of herbal tea as having watered down flavor. I had an opportunity to try this tea on a recent trip where they were serving it in the hotel lobby. I was so impressed with it that I wrote down the name and started searching for it when I got home. Not all stores carry it, and some of the stores that do charge a lot for it.

"This is a great find for anyone who is searching for a high-protein, easy-to-use, and bulk priced food source.  It is sealed in a vacuum packed bag, but is easily pour-able once you break the seal (no lumps from packaging).  The instructions tell you to use one (of the three pounds) at a time, and freeze the remainder to keep it fresh.  I used baggies to divide up what I froze into smaller units that would work for the speed/way that I consume it.  I bought this increased protein source because it is a fast way to add protein to salads, eggs, oatmeal, cookies, etc.  I have so many food intolerances that I have to be on the watch for ways to bring protein into my diet.  This is excellent for general health benefits, and will ""take on"" the taste of what it is added to (can be added to either a healthy cookie batter, or an entre such as a stir-fry or salad.  The price was the best I found, and shipping was fast.",Great Find,5

"If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",Perfectly Delicious,5

"We're staying at Stanford's Children's Hospital with my son, and I'm sure I don't have to elaborate how 'pleasant' hospital cafeteria food can be, even at a 'great' cafeteria (as hospital cafeteria's go, Stanford's is actually very good. But it is still cafeteria food). On weekends the Children's side cafeteria closes down so you have to go over to the main hospital's cafeteria for dinner. Grabbed a turkey sandwich and was looking for some chips or something crunchy, and I saw these. I'm a big coconut fan so I figured I couldn't go wrong, and it's healthier than potato chips so I'm game. I made the mistake of trying a bite of them before I had my sandwich, I didn't want to put the bag down! Holy smokes, seriously the best 'chip substitute' I've ever had, and if they weren't so expensive I'd switch over from potato chips completely!! Perfect combination of salty/sweet, loads of coconut flavor (I've had some where it's really subtle and mild, this definitely is not), great size strips (like someone said, looks like they put it through a strip paper shredder just a bit wider), perfect crunchiness. Anyways, definitely a rare treat because of the expense, but so worth every penny! I may have to grab another bag for the road home though before we get discharged this afternoon. ; )",Sooooooooo good!,5

"my husband loves pork rinds, i however was freaked even thinking about ""deep friend pork skin"" but i am always willing to try new things so over the years i have choked down countless brands of pork rinds to appease my husband.<br /><br />one day i was at work (at a hotel) and i notice over on the snacks for sale shelf microwaveable pork rinds. i was like WTF you gotta be kidding me, so being the good wife i am i buy them (more as a joke than anything else) for my husband well he zapped them bad boys and started happily munching away, oohing and ahhhing over how good they were, so i tried one (i refused to tell him that it was pretty good)..over time i bought him more, even ordering them thru the hotel (ya employee discount!!) and he noticed that i would ever so casually walk by and snatch one from his bag. finally i gave up and just made myself a bag. i am now hopelessly addicted however no longer work for the hotel so i needed a new supplier....lol<br /><br />our microwave has a popcorn button, on a whim i gave it a shot figuring it would be a microwave disaster, much to my surprise i got PERFECT bags of porky crunchy goodness EVERY TIME, and when i say perfect i mean not one single under done or burn piece. for the life of me i cant figure out HOW the microwave can use the same button to make popcorn and the pork rinds so perfectly. but i chalk it up to magic<br /><br />be forewarned if you have dogs.....these are doggy crack, (yes i know...don't give the dogs people food...yadda yadda) i am convinced if you waved one of these little buggers in front of your dog and told him to speak, he wouldn't bark, he would recite Shakespeare. i have never seen my dogs go that crazy over ANYTHING else",i REALLY didnt want to like these,5

"A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors.

Just be aware that in this 24ct package little packets of loose tea that make 3 qts of iced tea each, not large iced tea bags, so you will need an iced tea maker to utilize them.

"I have reviewed these macadamias several years ago and I am updating my review based on recent frequent purchases. I have purchased macadamias from literally every growing region on the globe, including South Africa (Planter's), Costa Rica , Australia (Trader Joe's) and Hawaii.  Nothing, and I do mean nothing, has the fresh, intense, buttery and unique aroma of Mauna Loa macadamia nuts. Other macs all taste mealy, bland, tasteless or rancid, including most generic store brands. The rich, volcanic soil of Hawaii continues to produce the finest macadamias on the globe in my opinion. If you are a distinguishing connoisseur and aficionado of the nut, you must have them or face serious withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite the purchase of Mauna Loa by Hershey Chocolate Corp. in 2004, the availability of Mauna Loa products, particularly on the East Coast of the U.S. remains challenging. This is because of increasing global market demand, shelf space limitations and slotting fees charged to supermarkets and other retailers to stock the items and recent unfavorable climate conditions on the Big Island.<br /><br />Mauna Loa has had significant price increases since 2010, particularly with the 4.5oz canned nut products. However, these nuts are still worth every penny if you purchase them fresh. I have since switched from purchasing these in the 4.5 oz. ""6-pack"", to 11 oz. pouches with Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" Subscription, because they are a bit cheaper and there is no additional charge for shipping.  Mauna Loa has finally embraced putting easy to read Best Buy (""BB"") dates on its products and this makes it easy to insure that you are getting fresh product. I hope I have made this an easy nut to crack!  Happy Munching.",Pricey Sack 'O Nuts...No If's And's or Butts... But Buy Them You Must!,5

It doesn't leave your hair that squeaky dry feeling when wet like after using a clarifying shampoo yet it cleans very well. I can get a comb through my hair easily after using it which is unusual for my long very fine hair that easily tangles. When my hair dried it was even a little wavy, very shiny and the fragrance is quite pleasant and lasted into the next day. My scalp has a tendency to break out from many shampoos but this one didn't do that at all.

I have been sipping this tea for nearly a decade and it is absolutely outstanding (and had fantastic experiences ordering it through Amazon).  I highly recommend it.  I do always warn folks to avoid tea bag teas in general since they are mostly created using the lowest quality tea leaves (""tea dust""), so invest in a tea stick (Google it) and enjoy loose leaf varieties so you can have a cup of tea at it's highest quality.  For what it is worth, never allow the tea leaves to sit in your hot water for more than three minutes (less than half that time for a cup rather than a tea pot full).  Enjoy!",Best Earl Grey Tea,5

"Did some comparison taste testing and this came out on top.  Organic and great flavor without the caffeine.  No surprise that Amazon is far cheaper than Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods.)  You'd think that making instant coffe is intuitive. There is a another counter intuitive way.  Many decades ago a young Greek gentlemen in Athens showed a way to make instant coffee that is still my preferred method.  Maybe because I grew up in London I prefer to boil my water on a stove top over nuking it.  While the water heats mix the instant coffee, granulated sweetener of choice (Splenda for me) and if using a non dairy creamer powder that as well into a thick paste with a little of the water that is heating.  Then when the water achieves a rolling boil pour into the cup and stir.  This method results in a nice foam (creama) on top that just pouring water on the coffee granules and then adding sweetener and creamer will not achieve.  Enjoy.",Great Flavor,5
"I really like this hemp protein, like A LOT !!!!!! I make a smoothie and it tastes good and a nutty flavor. I like how you can immediately digest it. I find this is cheaper than a lot of whey proteins. It is very healthy as it is plant based with tons of vitamins. I take 10 chlorella tablets as I am downing my smoothie . The blue/green, green algaes added to my diet have done wonders for my system, I love spirulina and chlorella daily for energy and cleansing, hemp protein just falls in line with a total healthy diet for the body in helping fight disease too. I have been interval training for 4 months now. I do a smoothie with spirulina, flaxseeds ground, hemp protein, coconut oil, banana, and a few frozen strawberries, comes out great. I would highly recommend hemp protein powder for working out, energy, to be regular, protein quickly to muscle after a good workout.

"Ok. I'm sort of a chili-head. Been one since a summer in Mexico about thirty years ago. There's never less than at least eight bottles of different hot sauces in my fridge door. Green, yellow, red; mild, hot, and death-wish. This has got to be one of the most versatile sauces I have. I've used it on shrimp instead of cocktail sauce, or added it to the cocktail sauce. On fries or onion-rings instead of ketchup. On sandwiches instead of mayonnaise. Spice up tomato soup. On hamburgers, hot dogs, eggs. It can be added to anything with a tomato-based sauce. Even on a tossed salad, straight or mixed with some kind of salad dressing. Etc etc etc. But not oatmeal...yet.<br /><br />Just for the record: SERVING SIZE = 1 tsp.(yeah right). 5-calories. 0-grams of fat. 100-mg of sodium - 4% Daily Value. 1-gram of sugar/carbohydrate. 0-grams of protein. No vitamins or minerals as such. BUT FLAVOR!!<br /><br />Personally, I think the heat's fairly mild. Since reaction to heat levels is so subjective and various (some find this mild, some think it's too hot) the following may serve as a comparative reference. I'm using the Scoville Heat Unit rating system. You can look it up online if you're unfamiliar with it. Briefly, it rates the ""heat"" level by determining how many parts of sugar-water must be added until the heat is no longer detectable, using a panel of around five ""judges."" So it's subjective, & not as scientific as, say, high-performance liquid chromatography.<br /><br />Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - 2,200 SHU (Scoville Heat Units) - that is, basically, 2,200 parts of sugar-water must be added to one part of this to reach the point that the heat is no longer noticeable. It has 44% of the heat of a regular jalapeno pepper.<br /><br />Classic Tabasco Hot Sauce: 2,500-5,000 SHU<br />Tabasco Green Pepper Hot Sauce: 600-1,200 SHU<br />Tabasco Habanero Pepper Sauce:7,000-8.000 SHU<br />Trappey's Hot Sauce: 1,200-1,600 SHU<br />Texas Pete: 747 SHU<br />Cholula Hot Sauce: 3,600 SHU<br />Dave's Insanity Hot Sauce: 51,000 SHU<br />Pure Capsicin: 16 million SHU<br /><br />Generally: 0-5,000 SHU is considered mild. 5,000-20,000 SHU is medium. 20,000-70,000 SHU is hot. And anything above that is extremely hot.<br /><br />***** Several excellent websites that have ratings for different hot peppers and sauces are: [...] for peppers<br />[...] for heat ratings of around 150 different commercial sauces.<br />I think the best is [...]. It has BOTH peppers and sauces, AND it has color pictures of the peppers and the sauce bottles.<br /><br />Most people have used Classic Tabasco, & it can serve as a baseline for heat comparison. So this Sriracha is just a little bit less hot than the Tabasco you'll generally find in a restaurant when you ask for ""hot sauce."".<br /><br />It's not going to REPLACE other hot sauces.

In fact, I think this bar is better than the other Hachez dark chocolates with a lower percentage of cacao.  The only reason I can imagine that someone would find this bitter is if they had never had anything darker than regular American milk chocolate, and even then, the taste of this chocolate is so much richer than milk chocolate that it can't compare.

"This is a great ""tea"".  Technically, it's not a tea-or so I'm told.  It looks like a tea, smells like a tea, brews like a tea, etc you get the idea.  It is naturally caffeine free so that is a bonus for those trying to avoid caffeine.  I expected this particular flavor to be somewhat like pinacolda but found that it is a light tea flavor with a cinnamon zing to it (which I happen to love).  Adagio teas are some of the best.  They come in a nice tin as loose leaf.  You will need a steeper of some sort or just brew a small batch in your coffee pot.  For me this is a great iced tea sweetened with a bit of sugar.  Oh I forgot to mention that this tea has a naturally sweet flavor to it so you could go easy on the sugar.  (But hey you only live once)",Spicy! and I love it.,5

"As far as salty snacks go, these are a veryclose second to the Meijer Organics cheese puffs. I like the 1.5 ounce bags, they are perfect for an on-the-go snack or in my lunch. The flavor is just like chips and salsa, perfectly seasoned and crunchy! One bag is 210 calories and a whopping 27 grams of whole grains, with 30% less fat than regular potato chips. Life is full of choices, this one is a no-brainer!",one of my favorites!,5

"I like the taste of dried fruit, but usually I feel as if I'm giving my jaws a workout whenever I eat some. These pears are soft, almost creamy in consistency, and sweet beyond belief.

"This is a great tasting Matcha.  I too was trying to recreate the Jamba green tea smoothie. (I read someone else was trying to recreate that one). There are no Jambas in my town except the one in the airport. So I tried my best to recreate the smoothie using this brand. I blended 1.5 tablespoons of Sweet Matcha to half a cup of plain greek yogurt, and ice and milk or water to taste. Not too bad. But I also add this to berry smoothies for a slight change in flavor. I started off trying to imitate that smoothie, but now I like the flavor of Sweet Matcha altogether. Will be trying it in the suggested recipes listed on the back of the packet.",Tastes great as a smoothie,5

"It's absolutely amazing how adding a simple dab of sugar can make a cupcake pop! The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.",A Touch of Elegance,5

"I adopted a cat last year from the SPCA.  They sent her home with a bag of Hill Science Diet.  Luckily, she was at the SPCA less than one week before I adopted her.  She became very ill once home.  Trying different things, I finally decided to try eliminating certain foods.  Every cat food you buy at big box stores has chicken in it, no matter the flavor.  So started reading lables at a leading pet store.  Still difficult finding one.  Petsmart had a store brand with turkey, and my cat ate this for months.  Then she wouldn't touch it.  Tried several other types before I came across this food.  No chicken.  She has been gaining weight since eating this food.  I am just keeping my figners crossed she doesn't tire of it.  Not many options out there.",Cat allergic to chicken; this food works,5

"I do not have celiac (that I know of) but am trying to adapt to a gluten free lifestyle to help with autoimmune issues. I just feel better gluten free.

I ordered on Friday afternoon 7/24 and UPS had my shipment to my door on Monday morning 7/27. I was VERY impressed! I have made killer pancakes, zucchini bread, banana bread, and AMAZING chocolate chip cookies. My entire family is enjoying this yummy baking mix!

"I am thoroughly impressed by this product.<br />Where to start?<br /><br />1. Brown rice based (healthier alternative to regular pasta)<br />2. Convenient - put in warm water for 1 minute and it's ready to cook? Amazing.<br />3. Absorbs flavors wonderfully (suggestion: try cooking it with a sauce based on balsamic vinegar)<br />4. It's like super angel hair pasta (very thin)<br />5. Easy to chew<br /><br />I made a stir fry with a sesame/balsamic vinegar sauce, chicken, onions, carrots and broccoli - it was delicious.<br /><br />The only problem, is that the package is 7 ounces (good for a 4-6 person meal) and it costs over 2 dollars each. If it was closer to $1 per packet, I would buy these regularly. I haven't seen this at food stores nearby, so I can't compare local prices..",Absolutely delicious and how incredibly convenient,5

"I got the sampler pack first and tried to find the one I liked best.  I really like the texture of this jerky as it's more like the ""real"" thing.  I also like primal jerky so I tend to go from one to the other as they are both so different.  Primal is softer and more oozy - difficult to eat on the run as the package can be hard to open.  This jerky is easy to throw in a ziploc and it's not messy in the least.  It's got a good flavor but it's really the texture that does it for me.",Best of the Vegan Dream Jerky,5

We are very health conscious people and now that our son is 2 and Halloween is approaching we decided to buy this HUGE bag of organic fruit juice lollipops.  We plan on having them so people in our neighborhood can give him this instead of the processed sugar candy bars.

"Ordered 4 bottles thru amazon (provided by vitacost and spending 50+ allowed me to get free shipping from them).  It took a little longer than I thought it should but the bottles were packaged beautifully, sealed and wrapped in a way that gave me confidence.  I love the taste of this stuff.  It's a concentrate and so, thick.  2 tablespoons into a glass of water or diet lemonade is great.  My favorite part is licking the spoon I used to measure.  Tastes like very tart and wonderful cherry pie to me, despite the fact that there is no added sugar.  I'm hoping it will help with my arthritis.",So far I love it!,5

"I bought the Gallon Jug of this about 7 months ago it is great to have on hand. This has a very fresh tasting tomato flavor and re-hydrates easily. I use it to make instant tomato soup, for sauces and in salsa as well as adding to soups, stews, and every where else that one might want some tomato  flavor.  Very easy to adjust texture  can be tomato paste or juice  and is fun to experiment with I even made little tomato balls as a kind of oddball appetizer and everyone who tried them was blown away. Very light weight dry does pack down a bit but has stayed dry in the jug with no problems. This is a  great staple for both daily use and food storage.

"I have 5 cats, and all 5 just love Soulistic.  My cats have always been dry-food cats.  After my princess got sick, I started researching cat food and came to the conclusion that wet food is better for them.  I've tried every brand out there.  My goal is to have my cats on a grain-free, high protein diet made of natural ingredients, and minimal by-products.  I've tried Wellness, Natural Balance, etc.  But my cats are just so finicky that they'll stop eating a brand after being served the same thing more than 2 days in a row.  But with Soulistic, they're still loving it, and it's been close to a year.  I notice they like the gravy ones better than the gelee ones.  I also try to switch up the flavors so they're not eating the same flavors every day as I find that they will be less enthusiastic if I keep giving them the same thing.  This brand is a bit watery compared to other premium cat foods.  But if you look at the ""meat"", it seems to be unaltered natural fish/chicken.  I don't know for sure though.  I think the watery gravy actually makes it easier to blend and tricks my cat into taking in more fluid.  Unfortunately, this brand is only available from Petco.  I'm not a big fan of Petco, but have no choice since my kids only like this brand.  I hope with more people buying this brand, they will start selling it somewhere else.<br />Oh, and my cat's favorite flavor is the tilapia and tuna (I think).","Delicious food and not as unhealthy as the ""junk"" on the market",5

I was pretty reluctant to try one of theses soups when our security officer brought some in.  After finally agreeing to eating it WOW is all I have to say.  If you like spicy soups this is a good soup for you.  Since then I have had one of these soups at least once or twice a week. They are great because you can pack these as a lunch on the go or if you do not have much time at home you can just boil some water and have a very good soup in a few minutes.  I would definitely recommend these soups to everyone.  They are spicy but not so spicy that you will go running for water. Just a small kick just to let you know it is there.,Great Balanced Soup,5

I usually leave the bad in the whole time I drink tea but don't have to with this.  I have stopped drinking any other brand.  I was worried at first as I wasn't sure how soon to order my new box.

"Of all the ""Subscribe and Save"" products, this is the one I've been waiting for -- Rosarita refried beans are a real staple, my #1 comfort food and #1 earthquake-preparedness food. With my Prime membership this works out to about a dollar a can, which is a decent price, and these cans are heavy to lug home on foot from the market! Add a tablespoon of chicken stock or water if the beans are too thick for your tastes. They're ideal with scrambled eggs, you want them to make a burrito out of, they're great on their own, maybe with some salsa or grated cheese -- I really love these beans. Very highly recommended! I'd read that Californians who had moved with their jobs back east to the Carolinas would have people visiting California ask ""Do you want me to bring you some beans?"" -- they're that iconic and that good. I've made my own refried beans from scratch and it's not a simple task. I am so pleased to be able to buy these from amazon.com!!!<br />--<br />Help!! The price went from $22 to $42 in two months!!!!

My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.,Great product just need to adjust the subscription.,5

The Americolor pens worked with just a small amount of pressure and created very small marks or larger if you tilted the pen.,So much better than wilton,5
"I love eating these chips. They have a nice nostalgic smell that reminded me of my old grandpa's butt when he walked by. Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger's rear, and it brings back memories. Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma. Scottyboy and I eat these by the dozens, and I requested them so much that ol Scottyboy, who's in charge of snack purchases, bought these in bulk, which makes up for the week he bought ten boxes of edible strawberry underwear for the office.",I love the way these smell,5

"I'm an older mother with my first child and I make all of my baby's food at home to avoid any unwanted ingredients and to make sure that my child has the freshest and best tasting food possible.  All his food EXCEPT for the NurturMe products that is!  I found their peas and apples while I was on vacation and was completely shocked at how fresh, bright, and tasty they are.  I refused to feed my child that grey stuff that passes for canned baby peas even from supposed ""organic"" or healthy brands because it isn't anything I would personally want to eat due to the processed taste and color.  As the other reviewer stated, I've honestly never tasted peas that were so fresh and sweet.  I would never have thought that dried baby foods would produce such a fresh looking and tasting end result, but they look and taste so much better than anything that is canned or in the plastic pouches.  I tried buying fresh or frozen organic peas myself and making my own pea puree but it never came out as nice as these.  When I used fresh or frozen peas my baby wouldn't eat them because I was never able to get the pea skins pureed fine enough and he kept choking and coughing while he ate them.  I make my own sweet potato, squash, blueberry, etc. but these are really the only green vegetables that he seems to love.  My only complaint is that they can be hard to find in supermarkets or big box stores.  Thanks Amazon for keeping them in stock.  And, yes, they are super handy for mixing into other foods or taking them on the go, but for me the main selling point of these is the fresh sweet taste which makes my baby scarf them down!",The only store bought baby food I will feed my baby,5

"This makes a tasty, easy appetizer.  It is the BEST dipping mustard!!!!  I don't like mustard, but this is the only one I will eat.  I was introduced to Herlocher's Dipping Mustard in a sampling display, at a grocery store in Dayton, OH.  They served it with pretzel sticks, that served as skewers for chucks of summer sausage & Monterey Jack cheese.  It wasn't too sweet or tart.  I was amazed that FINALLY I found a mustard i liked!<br /><br />I continued to purchase this produce until I moved back to Minneapolis in 1992.  Fortunately, I kept an empty jar so I could look for it in MN.  No luck.  I then tried numerous honey mustard, sweet mustard and various other flavors, hoping to find something similar.  I ended up throwing them all out.<br /><br />Just recently, I thought I'd check online to see if I could order it direct.  That's when I found in on Amazon.  I ordered several jars.  -Ended up eating a whole one myself!  I'm bringing it to our Thanksgiving gathering today to introduce it to my family.  I also plan to give additional jars as hostess gifts this Holiday Season, along with my story.  This is the 1st review I've ever written about a product.

"Although I didn't buy this cookie mix on Amazon, I needed to write a review and tell the world of cyberspace how outstanding the cookies are! The recipe couldn't be easier, and uses the common ploy of having the baker add eggs and butter that could have been included in the mix so they'll feel they're actually doing something. I tried to underbake them just slightly and they came out moist, rich, and flavorful, tasting and feeling like a high-end boutique bakery product. I stored them in a closed container and they still were moist 24 hours later, which is a real plus.

"One of my cats had to go on antibiotics for two weeks, and the vet offered ""pill pockets"" to hide the pills.  I chose the salmon flavor over chicken, as he prefers fish.  The vet also recommended first giving him a couple without pills inside as treats, which I did.<br /><br />The third one had his first pill hidden inside, and it worked like a charm.

"I have just discovered this coffee and I am all in on this trio. I do not even know where to begin. I liked all three of the flavors, as each had its own personality and taste. I was not a fan of hazelnut until I tried the Vanilla hazelnut flavor, now I am hooked. I could taste the subtle vanilla flavor and the Hazelnut was not too overwhelming. I really liked the Chocolate Caramel Brownie and the Toasted Southern Pecan, these flavors really made my mouth happy. None of the flavors left an aftertaste, none of the coffees were bitter or acidic. I have not done it yet, I am going to try each of the coffees as an iced coffee treat as this is how much I enjoyed the coffee.

Let me put it to you this way.  No other granola has me on the internet searching for it so I can buy it in bulk to save money.  Seriously.  It's crazy how much I love this stuff.  I complained to the owner of the store where I buy it that this particular flavor always sells out first.  He now keeps 2 extra cases on hand just for me.<br /><br />This granola is unique.  Maybe that's why some people don't like it.  It's like none I've ever tasted.  Once I made a bowl of it and had to stick it in the fridge to go and answer the door.  I of course forgot about it till the next day.  I saw it and it had turned into a oatmeal of sorts.

Being around the beverage business for years I have tried almost all sport and energy drinks and was a big soda drinker.  Boy have I changed my ways.  Water Joe is above and beyond any other caffeinated water on the market and I have tried them all. It has a natural extract from coffee beans and is bottled with Nicolet Natural Bottled water which comes from an aquifer deep in the Nicolet National forest in Northern Wisconsin.  The water quality surpasses just about any on the market and the water is untouched.  No filtration or chemicals needed just the best right out of the ground the way God intended it to be!!!  Switch over from those sugary chemical energy drinks and coffee and your body will thank you !!!!  Great product!!!,By far the best cafinated water on the market!!!,5
Go for it,Awesome,5
"I tried this cereal when my son was discovered to be allergic to peanuts.  Many cereal manufacturers are not labeling peanut allergens, nor will they answer questions about them when you call.  Post would not help at all.  Then I learned of Enjoy Life and their Perky's cereals.  I really liked this one.  It has a slightly nutty flavor, stays crunchy in milk and when mixed in with yogurt.  It is dense not lite at all.  It has a good level of fiber and the flax makes it have good fats too!  Plus, no unhealthy sugars.  My kids like the flavor, but have problems with the size since they are little tiny balls.  This cereal is great when making treats though.  It works well with crispie type treats and cookies.  I am next going to try it as a pie crust for the pumpkin pie this season.  Amazon has a pretty good deal on the price as well.  It is $4 per box at my local market at least.  I'm saving about a $1 per box ordering here.  I will buy again!",Very tasty allergy friendly cereal.,5
"I have always loved the Garden of Eatin' Chili-Lime chips, but these are a close second.  I also ordered the Nacho (which my kids like, but I can't eat).<br /><br />Anyway, the Guacamole chips are a great snack for long drives, but it is too easy to eat the whole bag full!",Wow!,5

I was using Royal Canin puppy food at first but then decided to give Wellness a try (for my husband's doberman puppy).  He loves it and its really put weight on him.

"I rarely review products on Amazon even though I use Amazon very often. I felt compelled to write a review for Bear Naked with Flax because I just got done eating some and I am the 1st reviewer!<br /><br />What a wonderful product. I am very health conscious and this product meets all the criteria.  High in protein, high in fiber, whole grain, omega 3, no artificial ingredients or preservatives. It also contains blueberries which are the most healthy fruit that are widely available in stores. On top of all this health...<br /><br />This product tastes amazing mixed with Vanilla yogurt too!<br /><br />Price is a little steep in my opinion.

"I admit that for many years I only liked the ""bad"" stuff in the grocery store that was chock full of high fructose corn syrup and didn't have maple syrup in it!  I just liked the flavor.  Other maple syrups (which were Grade A) just tasted watery to me and didn't have that rich flavor I wanted.<br /><br />But since we're trying to eat healthier now and getting rid of stuff with HFCS in it I wanted to find a syrup that tasted really good.  And I've found it!<br /><br />This syrup is really flavorful, dark in color, and very rich.  I just absolutely love it.  Never again will I go back to using the fake stuff when the real stuff is so incredibly tasty - not to mention better for you!  Thanks Coombs Family Farms for making this.  It's fantastic!",Fantastic Flavor...Hooked!,5
"This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.",Great Tea,5

"These moose antlers are a great natural treat for my small dogs. I bought the first antler piece because my trainer recommended  it as a preservative-free product. The pieces I purchased through Amazon are small but for little dogs like my 7 month old Chihuahuas they will last a long time. I prefer these over bully sticks or rawhides because they do not cause any tummy upset or difficulties with the pups' stool. For small dogs like mine, just a few minutes with a bully stick today means a rumbling tummy tomorrow. When I first introduced the antler piece, the female barked at it and ran away. The male immediately took to it so his sister had to give it a try. Now she loves them as much as he does. They will sit or down or just about anything to get their antler. Another plus is that I will let them bring the antler onto my lap! Not so with a slimy bully sticks.",Great Natural Treat,5

"These bars are excellent, as are all of the Fiber One products. Most people are so consumed with sugar and fat grams and they don't even think about fiber.

It's not just about staying regular, it's all about beating the odds against colon cancer.<br /><br />Fiber also helps blood sugar stay regulated by slowing down digestion which keeps your insulin steady.<br /><br />Thanks to fiber one for making these great products.

"My cats have been eating Innova EVO, another grain-free food, for a while.  I've noticed a great improvement in their general health but I was never really happy about the fact that their binder is potato.  Nature's Variety now makes Raw Instinct, which uses tapioca as a binder instead.  The kibble is square with some rough edges, which is an interesting shape.  The manufacturer applies a freeze-dried meat and pre-/probiotic mixture to the kibble before it goes in the bag.  My cats dig right in, and although most of their diet consists of wet and raw food, I like to feed them a tiny bit of dry to add some crunch and texture to their food.  This is a great food if you want high-quality meat proteins and no grains in your cat's diet.",A new grain-free choice for your cats,5

I thought I would try it at home before I learned the hard way that he did not like it.  WRONG!  Baby Chase LOVED this oatmeal with apples and cinnamon.  It smelled wonderful.

"I recently switched to this dog food from Nature's Variety Prairie.<br /><br />So far I am very pleased with the dog food.  When switching, I was looking for a certain range of protein and fat and Merrick Whole Earth met the requirements I was looking for (a protein reading of 27%, a fat level of 14%) and chicken meal and turkey meal is the main source of animal protein.  The dog food was also ""highly recommended"" by an independent dog food advisor site that I use.<br /><br />My dogs really (really) like this food and they eat as soon as I put it down (even their morning meal which is dry food only), so the taste of this food must really be to their liking.  Despite the fact my dogs are rescues (and who knows what they were eating when they were wildly roaming the streets), they are picky and with the Nature's Variety, half the time they never ate their breakfast.  Also, I have large dogs but for some reason they like the small dry kibble and this is kibble is on the smaller side.<br /><br />I have also noticed a positive change in their stool.  It is a little firmer and a bit smaller, meaning they are absorbing more and eliminating less.<br /><br />I actually really liked Nature's Variety while they were eating it but so far I think the switch was a very good one.<br /><br />****PRICE INCREASE UPDATE: I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER THAT THE PRICE INCREASE EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST WEEK IS AN ISSUE AS THE PRICE FOR THIS FOOD HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED.

"I've given these Gardetto's Roasted Garlic Rye Chips 5 stars based on their taste, but after reviewing the ingredients list the 5-star rating should be taken with a grain of salt. I just bought a bag of these from the grocery store after seeing them for the first time and I was so excited because they are my favorite part of the Gardetto's mix but it never has enough of them. Now I know why. I never realized just how bad they are for you, for just 1/2 cup you get 10 grams of fat, 3grams of that being Trans fat (the bad stuff), and while others have pointed out that it also contains MSG (Monosodium glutamate) studies have shown that it is perfectly safe [...] I'm more concerned about the high trans fat content and the overall high fat content, as well as the extremely high sodium content (320mg per serving). So while these rye chips are delicious, they aren't exactly the healthiest snack, far from it in fact. I'm not really sure why they are so high in fat, I mean you'd think baked rye bread chips wouldn't be so bad for you, but these really are terrible as far as health is concerned. It just isn't worth it for me because I already need to drop about 30lbs and these will not help matters, so I need to find a healthier snack. Having said that, they are REALLY tasty. I guess you just need to decide whether they're worth it, but if you do decide to buy them then please be sure to enjoy in moderation, your arteries will thank you.","So good, yet so bad",5

No bitterness.  No acidity afterward.  This coffee is phenomenal!  If we don't manage to find it nearby, you can be sure that we'll order some sooner, rather than later.",New Mexico Pinon Coffee,5

My dog got wise to the pill wrapped in cheese and would refuse to take it. Using a pill pocket is easier than anything else I've tried. My dog seems to prefer the chicken flavor over the beef and now having the dog take her medicine in a pill pocket has made my life a lot easier. I think this is a great product and a small bag goes far.,Pill Pockets work!,5

I really loved this for baking. I put it in cookies a lot to replace the chopped nuts. I also have rolled cookies in the almond flour before baking. I use it in place of some of the flour called for in quick breads. Very good! I plan on using it in pie crusts and bear claw filling.,Loved it!,5

"I don't have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that's another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat.  With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc.  Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn't similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds.  Annie's does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese.  What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac & cheese I have ever had.  Also, it's real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.<br /><br />For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):<br /><br />Kraft Mac & Cheese:<br />Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.<br /><br />Annie's Rice Pasta & Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.<br /><br />*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.<br /><br />Annie's also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.<br /><br />Also, Annie's does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it's a deluxe box.  This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there.  It's the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker.  Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn't as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta & Cheddar.  But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn't ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta.  I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake.  My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn't do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)<br /><br />It's a bit more pricey, I'll give you that.  But for a hint - do check Target occasionally.  They sell Annie's pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta & Cheddar for $1 a box!)  If only the prices were always so kind;)",The BEST!,5

"Funny reviewing something so basic, but this jasmine rice is great! The bags are a good size, last quite a while. I use this rice in my cheapie rice cooker and it turns out perfect. I don't bother rinsing it beforehand because 1. I'm lazy and 2. always seem to end up wasting rice because it falls into the sink! Because I don't rinse it, it sticks a little but the best way to avoid that I've found is to let the rice sit in the cooker for a few minutes after the timer goes off. I think the steam from the pot loosens whatever is stuck to the bottom. :)<br /><br />Anyway yes - basic, but delicious rice. We recently ran out of it and had to resort to using that plain, long grain white rice from the store. Blegh. Much much much prefer this jasmine rice! Recommended! :)",This rice is nice!,5

"Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel.<br />I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff. Its taste is pleasant and it is easy for an on the go status like what I was.<br />I recommend this to anyone who has a lot on their plate, especially if it is temporary and you aren't used to dealing with it all on a regular basis. That kind of stress can lead to a meltdown! I usually get sick with a really bad cold or such within a week of being back in my own environment but this time I did not. I wonder....well, I didn't have as much stress knocking my immune system down to germ take over levels maybe. Either way, I like it and I am a gonna keep it! In fact, I am going home again in 3 days....Calm, don't fail me now! :D",A fan,5

"I like the convenience of protein bars for an on-the-go snack that fits in a purse or bag. I've been in search of a bar like this for a while because most other protein bars I've tried either aren't satisfying or have as many calories and fat as a big candy bar. These South Beach bars have a very rich cocoa flavor that chocolate lovers will appreciate. They're only 130 calories but still have a good amount of protein to keep hunger at bay between meals. They're also much lower in sugar than similar bars in this category but it doesn't affect the taste. They are just the right balance of low calorie, great taste and still very satisfying.

"When one reconstitutes this milk powder with purified water to remove the herbicides and other pest controls building up from Genetically Modified herbicide tolerant crops, they will find this tastes just like the fresh milk from Organic Valley's family of small farmers across the country.<br /><br />Reconstitution means a good job blending in a blender, not just stirred, because this is non instant powdered milk. It will take a bit longer to prepare, but the taste is worth it.<br /><br />I will not purchase herbicide tolerant crops for my family.  Yet, the USDA and the Obama Monsanto Administration has deregulated soy, corn, cotton, canola, sugar beets, and alfalfa (the latter of which needed no herbicides previously) to be incessantly sprayed with Roundup and other dangerous weed killers.  This means that the crop fed to dairy cows, horses, and other livestock will be contaminated with foreign organisms (not plants unlike hybrids) to make a patentable plant which Monsanto owns for the purpose of forcing farmers to spray more Roundup, so more money can be made by Monsanto.  Less than 7 percent of all alfalfa had been sprayed with herbicides previously. But, all that will change if the dairy industry purchases GMO seeds for alfalfa.<br /><br />Our potable water supplies all over the country are becoming contaminated, although studies have been blocked by Monsanto.  Where studies were done in other countries, like Denmark, it was found that extremely high levels of Roundup (or Glyphosate, the trademark for the active ingredient) were building up in the potable groundwater.  AND, they are not planting GMO seeds, unlike the USA. Because of their studies, they have instructed the Danish farmers not to spray with Roundup for at least 3 years.  But, in the USA, farmers are instructed to read labels and are taught to use chemical intensive agriculture; studies are blocked from being published, and even physicians are not given the right to know.<br /><br />In Taiwan, a study was done on 93 persons who tried to commit suicide by ingesting Roundup. The symptoms were very much like gastrointestinal reflux disease that has affected people all over the USA who have consumed heavily sprayed Roundup Ready (and GMO) crops.  Even babies have GERD and the causes are unknown because studies have been blocked by Monsanto.<br /><br />Monsanto's presence has been at the USDA, and Michael Taylor, first a lobbyist, then the company's Vice President, was appointed to the US-FDA by the first President Bush and has been there ever since. Myriad Monsanto employees are at the FDA and EPA making policy and their policy only benefits their company, not our health or the health of our children.<br /><br />Where studies have been done outside the USA, researchers and physicians have found growing levels of new allergens, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems with GMO plants.<br /><br />Organic Valley is committed to growing the best alfalfa for their cows and for that reason, and since organic agriculture prohibits use of GMO seeds, I'm buying all the Organic Valley powdered nonfat dry skim milk I can find with its long shelf life.  I will not give my family GMO milk. We will stop drinking and eating dairy products, once all milk contains GMO's because pollinators carry them from crop to crop or the wind blows the pollen well beyond the six mile limit claimed by the USDA.  We will buy Organic Valley but not heavily sprayed herbicide tolerant GMO alfafa fed dairy products.",Best nonfat dry milk powder ever consumed,5

"I have been using olive oil for many years, even in sweet baked goods.  A couple of years ago the New Yorker magazine contained an article exposing all of the problems with Italian olive oils in recent years.  So I decided to switch to a Spanish olive oil, preferably organic.  Zoe ended up being my choice, mostly based on price and its fairly middle of the road flavor.  I have now been using it for about five years and remain satisfied.  It is not the best olive oil around, but it is consistently good and not priced so high as to cause pain.  I have not had problems with it going rancid.  I like the tin, but am still careful to keep it in a cool area rather than near the stove.  Once I have used half of the can's contents I prefer to decant the rest into a smaller, dark glass container.  I can't say that I love the spigot, but once I figured out how to pull it out I have had no problems.  The product stays in the tin or pours nicely into the dish or pot I am using when cooking.  I have not had any counter messes nor do I find a lot of oil around the spigot.  Finally, I like being able to buy through Amazon's subscribe and save program, which makes this oil a bit more economical to use.",A quality oil,5

"This tea actually tastes less 'spicy' than other chais, so the name is almost a bit misleading.  It could be described as more mellow than bold.  But, don't let this deter you if you favor bold teas. The complexity of this tea really works!! It has a wonderfully well balanced and pleasing flavor.  The additional herbs give it an added complexity not found in most chais and even a hint of sweetness. For maximum flavor I recommend steeping this for the full 6 minutes suggested. And, be sure to use two teabags if you're using an extra large mug. Love it!",My favorite black chai,5

"True Himalayan Pink Salt.  I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt.  I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)",Awesome Quality,5
"This tea is a wonderfully smooth black tea, with just a hint of black cherry flavor. The reason I like it is that it is not ""perfumed"" with over powering essence, as has become the trend in flavored teas.

All this, and being organic - what a treat!",Quaity black tea - no garish perfumes or oils,5

I fell in love with Kim's Magic Pop and their strawberry flavor when I tasted them during the 2012 Summer Fancy Food Show and have been a big fan ever since.

"I started my daughter on this formula when she was 7 months old as a supplement to breast milk because my supply was weakening.  I  wanted to give her organic if she couldn't have breast milk and we never tried anything else.  She had only had breast milk up to that point and she didn't hesitate to drink it up!  We haven't had any issues with her spitting it up as long as we make sure that she burps after she drinks more than 2 ounces.  She never really spit up with breast milk( only on a few occasions), but I noticed that if she didn't burp with the formula, she would sometimes spit up after drinking it.  She is 10 months old now and drinking this exclusively and she loves it.  I would totally recommend this product to others and their customer service line is great if you have any questions or concerns.",Great Product!,5

We live part time in Seattle where we could find these in season at Pikes Street Market but imagine our happy shock to find them for sale on Amazon after we came home to Oklahoma. Our favorite is the Russian banana fingerling which has a distinct buttery savor which will instantly cause you to forget the ordinary potato.  Our order consisted of 3# of 3 different varieties which we quickly sorted into their types and cooked at various meals to compliment our dishes.  Fast shipping and the product is fresh and delicious! Highly recommend.,Absolutely to die for,5

We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.,Good food for English bulldog,5

"Our daughter showed signs of colic in the first two weeks, so we immediately switched from Similac Advance to the Similac Sensitive.  Before she was born, I had purchased a large case of the 2oz ready-to-feed bottles (one of Advance, one of Sensitive) just in case. We had nearly used all of the Advance by the time she started having problems, so I switched her to the Sensitive. It definitely helped. I still had to supplement her with gripe water (we used Colic Calm - my goodness, that product is WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY, if you have a colic child PLEASE don't waste any time, pick up the Colic Calm at your local CVS or order it online through their website, it saved us).<br /><br />Here's the catch - after a while, I tried to switch her to the powdered version of the Similac Sensitive.  I will be honest here and say that the powdered version ends up thinner, causing more spit up and hiccups.  You also have to be careful when mixing it.  If you shake it up, it becomes very bubbly with air and causes tremendous amounts of gas. For us, it was as if she had gone back to her colicky ways again.  I knew it had to be the powder, so I put her right back on the liquid ready-to-feed and she is amazing again.  Sleeping 6+ hours at night, no fussiness, etc. I hope this helps someone - good luck parents!",Definitely helped with gas! Much better than powdered version!,5

"Last week I made my first cake with Pettinice. I was scared that I wouldn't like it. I've tried Fondariffic, but it was way too soft and sticky. I used Choco Pan once, but it dried out faster than other brands. I used to make my own MMF to save $, but it's just such a pain. Satin Ice was my brand of choice, but was prone to elephant skin. I even tried Duff's fondant, and while it covers well, it doesn't taste good (although nothing is as bad as Wilton- blech). Let me just say I LOOOOOOVED Pettinice!!! It was so easy to use, it covered well, no elephant skin, and it tastes good both before and after drying (something I can't say of Satin Ice). Kneading was no problem- didn't even have to heat it as some reviews have noted. Some people even said they had to add glycerine to soften it up, and while I had it ready, it soooo didn't need it. There are still a few brands I'd like to try, but I think I found my brand of choice (aside from times when I need really deep colors).",My favorite so far!!!,5

"I was surprised when i've opened the bag, such a powerful aroma. And its taste is even better...Be sure you like cinnamon and cloves, because the aroma is quite powerful. But it's balanced by the mint and the orange peels and this is what makes this tea so good. It doesn't even needs sugar, because it's kind of sweet by itself.<br /><br />The price is very good, considering the quality and how much you get for the price. Even the bag is quality made, aluminium inside and air tight sealed; it also has a plastic zipper, so you can reseal the bag every time (though i don't think it will be completely air tight, as it's when you first open the bag).",Wish i could give it more stars!,5

"This is the first time I've had Freekeh and it was excellent! I will now stock my pantry with it as a staple. It's low in calories, high in fiber and high in protein -- and also high in flavor.

Add the Freekeh and Sage to the pan and ""toast"" the Freekeh with the cooked onions for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add white wine and stir until the wine has been completely absorbed. Add enough broth to completely cover the Freekeh. Stir and allow to simmer until the broth has been mostly absorbed. Add about another cup of broth, stir, simmmer...continue this process, adding about a cup of broth at a time, until the Freekeh begins to release its starches and looks creamy. This will take about an hour. (If you run out of broth before the desired consistency has been achieved, start using warm water instead of broth.) Turn off heat. Immediately add Parmesan, cream cheese and spray butter. Mix in thoroughly until cream cheese has melted.

"This is a mild curry with surprisingly strong flavor. I have used it for years, but ran out a while back and had trouble finding it so was forced to used other curries.

Curries can take over food so that the taste of vegetables and other ingredients are completely lost. Other curries are too mild and have an uniform taste. Not so with Ship Brand. The taste is mild enough to allow other flavors to shine without being tasteless or bland.<br />I highly recommend this curry.",Best curry powder available anywhere,5

"I bought a 6 oz jar of this conserve to try and liked it so much I almost ordered the six-pack deal Amazon has, which is very good, but then I saw this 48 - 1 oz pack and I like it a lot more because this way I can just have a serving as a treat every now and then without having an opened large jar taking space and aging away in my fridge.<br /><br />Real fruit taste and no food coloring or preservatives (no syrups, no processed sugar), just red raspberries, pomegranate, concentrated grape juice and fruit pectin.<br /><br />The texture of this delightful conserve is different from jam or marmalade, not as thick, more like between jelly and jam, and the flavor is fruitier. You can definitely taste the raspberries and pomegranate.<br /><br />A very good choice for those with a sweet tooth who don't want or can't eat highly processed sugars.<br /><br />Great product from France.<br /><br />The lil' jars are very useful for storing spices, individual salad dressing for the lunch box, etc., and also for non food things like beads, powders, and many other craft items.<br /><br />TIP: A few of these little jars in a cellophane bag with a nice ribbon make a lovely present.",Perfect size for a sweet treat every now and then and the jars are very useful.,5

"I am not particularly familiar with Singaporean food, but I do love curry in all of its iterations (Thai, Indian, etc.), so I was excited to get this.  This curry is a mix of a spice blend and a coconut base, which makes for a tasty sauce.  The box recommends beef, so that is what I used.  Following instructions I pan-fried the beef, then added the spices and coconut mix.  The box suggests using a different pan to make the sauce, but I just dumped it in with the beef and it still turned out well.  The result was a flavorful, slightly spicy curry, which went well over jasmine rice.  The box also suggests mashed potatoes, but I think I far prefer it on rice.  This is a great dinner for a rushed night- simple, fast, and tasty.",Yum.,5

"I just got my bamboo today.  It arrived so so quickly (that's why the shipping costs are so much- they ship it USPS, but it's SUPER quick; they're located in CA, and I got it in three days.  I'm in IL)  The bamboo arrived healthy, and looked just as tall as the picture shows, and very green.  Looks wonderful.  I also purchased some Super Green from KL Design & Import; and got that the same day too (highly recommend that to go with Bamboo)<br /><br />Anyway, my only disappointment was that the photo shows a lovely holding piece; looks almost like a dark wood or ceramic piece.  The one that it comes with is much lighter colored (look at the user pics) and has a random leaf printing on it.  It's not nearly as nice looking, so that is a bummer.  I wish it was darker.  That's my only complaint.  Will update if I have anything to add later on.  Still a great bamboo piece, and I recommend seller.  It will live in my office cubicle to brighten things up. :)<br /><br />EDIT: April 10th, 2012<br /><br />Just giving an update on this.  The bamboo is still healthy, and growing great.  My one disappointment was that the spiral piece that came with it has not grown at all since I got it.  It's still the same size, and with the same leaves.  It's still green and alive, but has not shot up and grown new leaves like the other two straight stalks.  I may actually break off the spiral part and let it grow more naturally.","Great & healthy bamboo, decent holding piece",5

"I was a little be leary of buying this after having tried the Annie's whole wheat shell macaroni and cheese which we thought was just horrible.  This macaroni, however, tasted wonderful!  I think that this has a lot more flavor than the Kraft macaroni and it's so much better for you too!  At first, my two year old would not try it as it was not the yellow color of the Kraft macaroni.  So, I added a little bit of orange food coloring (the sauce is white so any color would work perfectly) and he was so excited about orange macaroni that he gobbled it right up, telling me repeatedly how yummy it was.  I think we can have some fun mixing up the colors in the future.  I would highly recommend this!",Even My Two Year Old Loved It!,5
"I have to admit - when I saw this at my local pet store, I thought, ""sardines? Are you kidding?""  Well, I took the plunge and grabbed a few cans anyway and wouldn't you just know it - the Persian king inhaled it faster than my Bissell Pet Hair eraser vacuum!  Fastest shot of blue lightening ever!  Imagine Garfield and you can get the picture.  It's the same as all the other shredded varieties - some thick gravy and the meat of choice, but it's the sardines that sets this one over the top in this house.  I always put a bit of warm water in with the food to give the cats extra water and they love it.  Great, great new flavor, highly, highly recommend!",Disappeared in an instant,5
"When I was little, I coined a word for things that tasted SO good, just about nothing else could compare.  The word is: ""scrumptuutious"", (pronounced ""scrump-TOO-shus"", or ""scrump-TOO-tee-us"", if you prefer an English pronounciation....  Very, very few foods qualify for this appelation --but ""ROBINSON'S APPLE & BLACKCURRANT -- also known as ""Fruit Squash"" -- qualifies with a capital ""Q""!<br /><br />If you buy this delicious drink, my first suggestion is that you remove the labels, as much as is possible, from the tall, elegant plastic bottles. (This was not too difficult at all, at least for me, as the bottles I received had their labels very, very lightly attached to begin with.)  Then take the bottle(s), and put them in the refrigerator, and have the refrigerator's light shine through the bottle(s).  The dark-red liquid inside is so extraordinary, that you may see a beautiful, optical illusion: It may seem as if the slim, elegant bottle(s) is (or are), suddenly filled with the most equisitely beautiful and costly ruby....shaped just like the bottle(s)!  Or, if you wish, a non-alcholic beverage that looks exactly like the finest of fine red wine!  Of course, this is really just the pure, transparent concentrate inside, lit up and lit through, by your refrigerator's light....but it really is something quite wonderful, and quite beautiful, to see!<br /><br />I suggest you do this JUST after having received your bottles.  For this way, they are unopened, and you get to see the whole bottle lit up.  However, once the bottle is opened, the wonderful taste within will probably be a precursor to there not being very much left in the bottle, for very long....no matter how much you, and/or others in your household  try to restrain yourself! (selves!)<br /><br />If you like grape juice, you will absolutely LOVE this drink.  (If you don't like grape juice, it is possible you won't like FRUIT SQUASH either,,,but to be sure, give it a try anyway...) There is a slightly more sweet, slightly more acidic taste to this drink than plain grape juice has.  Black currants are, I have learnt, a separate variety of small, dried grapes. (Note too that ""currant"" is spelt with an ""A"").<br />Don't let the price scare you off....this is a CONCENTRATE!  The front label directions of this Fruit Squash -- describing milliter servings -- may be a little confusing for those used to ounces, instead of milliliters.... But on another Robinson Prouduct -- the equally scrumptuutious LEMON BARLEY WATER, (also, I must shamelessly admit, reviewed by me for Amazon.com) -- it is more clearly stated:  ONE part Robinson product, to FOUR parts water. Actually, these directions are also on the Apple and Blackcurrant fruit squash....but only on the back label, in far smaller letting.  (Note to Robinson's Sopft Drinks, Limited, and Britvic.com -- PLEASE put these far more clear,<br />""one part Robinson's to four parts water"" directions, on ALL your products, in LARGE lettering, on either front or back label.  Your American and other customers who are more familiar with ounces than they are with milliliters, will thank you!) In any event, this means that each 1 liter bottle, (slightly more than a quart), will make FIVE liters of fruit squash!  This is a bit over one gallon & a quart....and thus the concentrate serves to save LOTS of room in your refrigerator, as well as allowing one to add whatever water, (tap, Evian, distilled, etc.), one wishes!<br /><br />Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant is good either hot or cold.  It's also good to add to recipes....either full or half-strengh...when ""grape juice"" is called for.  But please....use full or half-strength ONLY for recipes! It is tempting, I know, to try the concentrate full-strenght for drinking...and, (as I am, after all, reviewing this product for the benefit of other people), I did take the liberty to do just that, once or twice, (ok, maybe I tried it full-strenght three or four times....just to make sure, and ONLY for testing purposes, you of course understand...: )  Anyway, drinking this product full-strength led, for me anyway, to my heart beating faster than usual.  A danger sign...so I stopped doing it.  Grapes are used to make wine, after all, and though this product is non-fermented, and thus non-alcholic, a strong, concentrated dose of liquid grapes DOES have a negative effect...albeit, for me, (weighing as I do, some more than few pounds overweight), only a slight negative effect.  On the label of both Robinson Proucts which I have tested, in fact, are words of warning to be sure ""to add extra liquid, if given to toddlers, (and children)"".  It is far more economical, and far safer, to follow the directions and add the four parts water for drinking, (and perhaps also cooking), purposes.  The taste is remarkably the same to drinking the concentrate ""straight""...and if, like me, you like things extra, extra sweet, a small bit of extra sugar, (mixed with the smallest amount of boilt water, to dissolve), and or artificial sweetener, can be added.<br /><br />This is, as I have said, a non-alcholic drink.  But it is SO very tasty, so VERY satisfying, that it can be served with pride to even those trying to moderate, or eliminate their consumption of alcholic drinks -- or to those who, for religious or other reasons, have decided to foreswear alcholic drinks altogether.  Diluting it to five or six parts water to one part conentrate make it, I think, the perfect treat for children's birthday parties!<br /><br />It's kind of difficul6 to believe that only 8% of this product is from comcntrated Apple Juice, and only 2% is from concentrated Blackcurrant juice.  The front label proclaims, however, that there are ""NO Artificial<br />Colours or Flavours"" inside, and this is true.  In all, the ingredients listed are: Water.<br />  Fruit jiices from concentrate, (Apple 8%, Blackcurrant 2%)<br />  Glucose-Fructrose syrup<br />  Sugar<br />  Citric Acid<br />  Natural Colour, (Anthocyanins)<br />  Preseratives (Potassium Sorbate,<br />  Sodium Metabisulfite)<br />  Acidity Regulator, (Sodium Citrate)<br />  Sweeteners (Aspartame, Saccarine)<br />  Natural Flavouring<br /><br />  CONTAINS A SOURCE OF PHENYLALANINE.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good label -- especially these days.  NOT entirely natural...but with ingredients found in many other soft drinks, none of which taste quite this good!<br /><br />...................................................................<br /><br />""I can't believe how good they are!""  This is how my sister, visiting my mother and I in New York from her home in Denver, described her first taste of GUYLIAN Belgian Chocolate sea-shells, (also for sale here on Amazon!)  I suppose this was her way of saying ""Scrumtuutious""!  Either way, this also describes the delectable, wonderful taste of ROBINSON'S<br />APPLE & BLACKCURRENT.  Five stars....and, (as the company has been in business sine 1823), a Hundred and Eight-Six ""Cheers!""",S O O O O O......G O O D...! ! ! ! !,5

"I assume that if you are looking at this product, you understand that reptiles need calcium supplements. I bought this supplement for my children's Russian Tortoises that live in a habitat in the back yard. In the past, I have used the calcium with D. But I read that if they have access to sunlight, which ours do, that they don't need anywhere near as much Vitamin D. And since Vitamin D is a fat soluble Vitamin, too much can become toxic. I mix one part with D to four parts without D, and the tortoises are doing great. They had another batch of healthy babies, which the kids easily sell to pet stores. Without the calcium, they get soft shells that become deformed. We have one male and six females, so I appreciate the savings on the larger size container. Great product! BTW, small ones that we keep inside get the full D. We take them outside once a week and let them run around for a few minutes, but it is not the same as sunning themselves.",Little Money Makers,5

"My daughter told me about all the benefits of coconut oil and I decided to order this one from Amazon and try it out. So far, I have used it for (1) extremely dry skin on my face and around my hairline. I could see an improvement after just one day and it's continued until I no longer have patches of dry skin and the skin on my face is glowing. (2) I severely burnt my tongue tasting some soup and the next day it was so painful I could not eat. I coated my tongue several tiimes that day in the coconut oil and it was completely well on the third day. (3) On my grand daughters diaper rash and on her dry flaky feet. Her feet were peeling they were so dry and we cleared it up in a week with the coconut oil. (4) I coated my dry hair in the coconut oil and left it on all day and then shampooed it out before going to bed. My hair was soft and shiny the next day to the point that several people asked me what I had done to my hair. Now I regularly soak my hair in the oil and my hair is beautiful. (5) I made a face scrub with the oil and sugar and it works wonderfully for getting the dead skin off my face and feet at a fraction of the cost of the expensive scrubs and works better and smells good too.<br /><br />The oil does not stay on your skin, it is absorbed quickly and does not stain your clothes or bedding. I ordered two tubs with Subscribe and Save and the price was a real bargain except my sister begged me out of one of my tubs, so now I have to re-order quickly. I don't want to be out. I keep a small jar of the oil on my desk and use it several times a day on my hands and elbows. Those rough ugly elbows will dissappear in a week and you will have smooth white elbows if you just rub some oil in once a day.<br /><br />I have not used the oil for any kind of cooking because that is not the reason I wanted it, but I have read that it is great for use as a cooking oil. I know my grand daughter loves to stick her finger in the jar and lick the oil off. She loves it and I know it will not hurt her.<br /><br />Would I order this again? Yes and yes. I would and have it on permanent order with Subscribe and Save. I don't want to ever be without it again.",I love this stuff,5

Peeling green chiles in the lunch room makes a bit of a mess.  Prepared green chile could be left in the office fridge, though.",Tastes real,5

"I highly recommend this product!  There is nothing better than steel-cut oatmeal.  For years I hated oatmeal, until a year ago I tried this oatmeal.  After reading about how nutritious and healthy this was, I decided to give it a try.  It is delicious!  I prefer it with soymilk and often add golden raisins and a few nuts chopped up.  But it is just as good with blueberries, bananas, or chopped apples.  Whatever fruit you want to add works!<br />Give yourself a treat and just try it for a couple of mornings, and you will be hooked!  Since I leave for work really early, I often make a big batch the night before, refrigerate it and microwave a bowl of it for breakfast every morning. (It can stay refrigerated for about 5 days and still taste great!)<br />All I can say now is Enjoy!",Nothing better!,5

It also does chicken proud.  We serve them on fresh flour tortillas.",Super Tasty,5
"At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.",Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!,5

"I love Zaatar bread and Zaatar crackers and have tried perhaps as many as 15 different brands and this blows them all away. Not even close, this is by far the best. Perhaps because I was introduced to Zaatar in Lebanese cooking so this brand is Lebanese and probably what was used on my favorites. Just get some pizza dough, roll it out thin or how you like it, mix zaatar and oil and spread over the dough. Bake it in 450 deggree oven till done. Make sure you put some oil on the pan under the dough too. This is the easiest and perhaps the best way to get your Zaatar. This bag of 10 lbs will last me at least a year. You can freeze it in double heavy duty freezer bags and it will keep for years.",Tried almost every major brand of Zaatar and this is the best!,5

One thing that helps keep my bones toasty is this fine quality hot chocolate.  I first got turned on to this brand when I took a free sample from a care package at the local Red Cross on post.  From the first cup I was hooked.  This is the best tasting instant hot cocoa I ever had...ever!  After this, I can no longer go back to the less expensive products.  Every sip of this cocoa is like being on top of mount Everest with the cold brisk wind flowing through your hair but at the same time a warm fuzzy sensation is circulating throughout your body keeping you warm from the hard mountain top conditions.

It is still a good price at 17 but when a customer subscribes at a certain price I really think It should stay at that price and if the need to raise the price arises the customer should be informed first and given the option of opting out before having to be shocked at the email received that says.. ""Oh look your subscribe and save stuff is ready to ship, and oh by the way its now this much higher"".

"My girlfriend procured a pack of these the other day and had me sample several of the flavors.<br />I generally have a discerning fruit candy flavor- I dislike many flavors (Eg orange, anything blue etc etc) however I was taken aback by the incredible flavor of these gummies.<br />The consistency is perfect- firm but yielding in each piece, lightly covered in non-overwhelming sour grits perfect for chewers and suckers alike. I will continually use perfect to an excessive amount, because this is exactly what these sour candies are.<br />The shapes are all in hearts, which makes perfect (again!) sense. There is a myriad of flavors, including out-there pomegranate and mango, which is not normally found in the sour candy sections. Each pack contains a generous helping of these candies, so each pack, regardless of the count, will last you quite a while (unless you're like me, or have friends).<br />Contains real fruit juice, great flavor and is so addicting I'm going to go steal more from her, and not finish this rev","Delicious, Balanced Flavor",5

(Not punch, just pinch)<br /><br />Very fresh right out of the bag, nice small sized chip.<br /><br />The olive flavor was overpowered by any dips or salsas. It tastes best to me plain, but then again, I tend to like vanilla flavored ice cream.

"Mint is one of my favorite herbs so when I ran across this chutney in the supermarket the other day, I had to purchase a jar.  I was completely impressed by this high quality blend.  The taste is not overpowering.  While this chutney is made with serrano peppers and cumin powder, I did not find the chutney to be hot.  The heat provided from the peppers and cumin blends fabulously with the coriander and mint and the eating experience is marked by a progression of different flavors with the first taste being a sugary coriander and mint blend followed by the heat of the pepper and cumin powder.<br /><br />The first ingredient for the chutney is water but I did not find the blend to be watery.  I eat my chutney with poppadums (either ready made by Truly Indian or the cook your own version by Lijjat) and I had no problem with this chutney staying on the poppadum.  The second ingredient in this chutney is coriander and the user can definitely taste its presence.<br /><br />I purchased this product at my local Meijer supermarket (in the international foods section despite being made in the United States).  I paid about 5 dollars for a 7.5 ounce jar.<br /><br />I love this product and will purchase again.  Swad makes other chutneys, including a coriander chutney for those interested in other flavors.<br /><br />Amazon does not yet have the product ingredients posted. Here they are:  Water, coriander, mint, serrano peppers, coconut, salt, soybean oil, cumin powder, sugar, coriander powder, citric acid, guar gum, xanthum gum, FD&C Blue #1 and Yellow #5.<br /><br />There are approximately 12 servings per 7.5 ounce jar.

"I think this horchata is just as tasty as ones I've had in mexican restaurants.  The nice thing about this product is that it lacks hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, and dairy products which I have found in some powder mixes and concentrates. It's a little sweeter than I thought it would be, but normally my horchata from restaurants has ice so maybe I'm used to a more dilute flavor.

"Torani Sugar-Free syrups are some of the best in the business. This makes an excellent flavor addition to both smoothies and coffee and it tastes just like the full sugar versions. What makes it even easier to use is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W09XZG"">Torani and Davinci syrup pump</a>. According to my favorite barista at Starbucks, a venti takes 5-6 squirts, although I think I normally use only a couple of squirts to obtain the perfect flavor for my smaller cups of coffee made at home.

Since Torani currently makes 27 different Sugar Free flavors, it would be nice if through Amazon they would offer a combo pack of 4 flavors, or just make more flavors available on Amazon. I really enjoy this syrup and have tried other brands, but always come back to Torani. I was pleased to see this available as a auto-ship item at Amazon and will be buying many more bottles through the Subscribe & Save program.<br /><br />I would love to see Peppermint, Vanilla Bean, and Irish Cream flavors added.

"My uncle from San Diego actually introduced this to me several years ago, but living in Washington state, with delicious water, I wasn't too concerned.  After going on many getaways, however, and having to face disgusting water at various locations, I realized that this was the best option for delicious portable water.  It is taste free and (if this makes any sense) has a light feel with absolutely no aftertaste.  I am not a fan of Aquafina or many other brands of bottled water because they haven't been filtered in any way, this has every impurity removed.  I realize that it is expensive for water, so I wouldn't buy this for daily consumption, but it is the best option for when we need water on the go and can't make use of refillable containers. Also, it is comforting to know that Penta is so confident with their water and process it that they have patented it (it takes 11 hours to filter their water in order to remove every element of trace pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other things which make water less than ideal).",Perfect Water,5

It is not like the canned stuff you get at the market. We like to make a large batch and eat on it for several days. It tastes better after it sits over night, why I do not know, maybe it marinates? I always go to the market and purchase a lean pot roast and have the butcher grind it into hamburger, We add this to the chili and sometimes a little red bell pepper.

"I have used this brand of coffee for a long time. The flavor is robust and mellow. I like the whole bean better than the ground so I can grind it the way I like it. I have tried the frence roast whole bean also, and it is a fuller bodied flavor but still smooth.

"This really is a yummy cracker.  My kids love goldfish crackers and hubby loves cheezits.  In my quest to more healthy eating, I found these and they really are a good alternative to both.  They have the small fun shape that appeals to the kids, but they taste more like a cheezit, only with all natural ingredients.  I signed up for subscribe and save every two months and I may have to change it to every month.  We got the first shipment less than a week ago, and we already opened the second box.",Good Cracker,5

"I don't go to Starbucks often, but when I do I usually get the Vanilla Latte.  While this isn't creamy like a latte, it does have a similar vanilla flavor (an great aroma too).

"I have been feeding my dogs Pedigree Plus Healthy Digestion Premium ground Entr&eacute;e with chicken & brown rice.  I buy it at Walmart in 13.2oz cans for 97 cents a can.<br />It upsets my dogs stomachs to change dog foods so I keep a good supply.  For some reason Walmart was out of the Healthy Digestion for over a week, so I decided to turn to Amazon. (BAD MOVE).  They divided my order between two warehouses.  One (TheNewMall) sent me 16 cans and charged me $53.58 ($3.34875 per can includes shipping).  The other (Ozbo) sent me 12 cans and charged me $44.58 (3.715 per can includes shipping). I thought I was getting 48 cans for $98.16 (2.045 per can includes shipping).  I understand how Amazon became a wealthy company almost overnight.<br /><br />I will try to change my dogs to a food that is not so hard to get. Pedigree company employee I talked to on the phone could not care less if I was having trouble finding an outlet for their ""Healthy Digestion"", He told me to use the link ""find a store near you"". (None of them even carry ""Healthy Digestion"").  The only thing I could get out of the person I talked to with Pedigree is they would not sell directly to me and they were not discontinuing the product.","I Like Pedigree, I don't like Amazon",5

They taste very much like the usual Peanut Butter cups, but they have the advantage of being less messy and you also don't end up with all those leftover ""cups"" every time you have some.  Also, the package they come in is one of the new resealable ones.  So you don't have to move the contents to some other packaging once you've opened it.

"This is now one of my favorite ramens ever.  If you're looking to graduate from the stuff you find in the regular American supermarket and your tastebuds are adventurous, you could do a lot worse than this.  It tastes citrus-y, peppery with other notes underneath that round out the flavor so it's not just too 'bright' as some citrus-y foods are or too hot as some peppery foods can be.  It is definitely quite hot, however, so if you're not into hot food, think 3 times before trying this.  That said, you should know that it comes with three separate packets and you don't have to add all of them to the mix.  The main flavor packet is a must, but the pepper packet and the paste could be left out and you'd still have a meal, though not quite as delicious in my opinion.<br /><br />Tastes really good with added dried shitake mushrooms, dried shrimp and dried seaweed, all of which add bulk and absorb the flavors nicely.  This is a creamy ramen -- if you haven't had one of those before, this is definitely the one to start with... again, assuming you like things hot.",Very Good and hot!

This stuff is plenty affordable in the 30-count bag, and the flavor is exactly the spicy & sweet combination I remember from my youth in the South.<br /><br />It just arrived today, so I've not had the chance to try it with club soda in place of water, but I expect adding some fizziness will make this drink perfect!

"I've always like Quaker Oat Squares, and these Cinnamon Quaker Oat Squares are no exception.  The texture of the oat squares themselves resemble Life cereal a bit but with much more substance; they are crunchy and filling, and hold up to milk quite well (they don't get soggy in the bowl as quickly as many other cereals do).  They also make a handy snack without the milk (as I'm eating them right now).<br /><br />The Cinnamon variety adds a touch of cinnamon flavor - not overwhelming at all, but blends in well with the oats.<br /><br />Coupled with the relatively low sugar added (9 grams per serving) and 5 grams of fiber, this seems like one of the healthier mass market cereals available.  That plus its good taste make this an easy product to recommend.",I've always like Quaker Oat Squares,5

Once I got the mixture right (use 1/2 tsp for every 8oz), my opinion changed.  The flavor is great, and I love it!

"This is some great coffee, better than any flavor of Starbucks or grocery store grind-your-own.  The flavor is smooth and mellow vanilla with hints of caramel.  I like iced coffee, so I cold brew mine, which brings out the smoothness of the flavors even more.<br /><br />The 3-pack price is pretty comparable to buying a single pack of this (or Starbucks) on sale from a grocery store.  Give it a try...I found this about a year ago and have tried 6-8 other brands/flavors since then but always come back to ol' Folgers Vanilla Biscotti.<br /><br />Cold Brew:<br /><br />Mix 2 c. ground coffee with 9 c. water in a pitcher and let it sit on the counter for 10-12 hours.  Strain (I use a coffee filter in a funnel) into another container, and store in the fridge for up to two weeks.  This is a concentrate, so when you pour a glass, mix it with an equal amount of water.<br /><br />If you enjoy iced coffee, please, PLEASE do not hot brew coffee and then cool it down.  It's like looking at a mediocre painting of a mountain range...you sit there looking at it, thinking you're enjoying yourself, with no idea that the actual mountains are at your back.

The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it.

"In 2008 I transitioned away from soy after having low testosterone levels. I've been a vegetarian most of my life, and soy had been a staple for me because of the ability to make it taste like almost anything. So, after searching around and trying a variety of different proteins, I found the Nutiva 50% Hemp Protein and was delighted. High protein, good fiber, good fats, and versatile. I sprinkle a serving on my salad or make a thicker dressing. I also like to mash it with juicy fruits like berries. I tried it with spaghetti squash the other day and it was pretty good. I've brought a spinach salad to a potluck with a serving sprinkled over the spinach and tomatoes. Everyone asks what it is, but after they've gone back for seconds. The hardest thing is that it's green, so it doesn't mix well with foods of other colors. So, you're certain to get stares at your green food, but you're probably already used to that if you're looking at hemp protein in the first place. My resistance training progression has been completely positive and my endurance has improved. As a vegan athlete, all I can say is that this stuff is a necessary addition to my diet.",good food,5

I put it on top of eclairs, I mix 1/4 into my favorite brownie recipe to give it that chocolatey punch, I use 1/2 cup in cookies in place of chocolate chips, etc, etc, etc. I keep it in the fridge and a jar lasts me about a year and I use it at least once a week. I am buying a jar to divide up and give pint jars of it to all family and friends for christmas!",Best secret ingredient ever,5
I'm very happy thank you filpkar boy and fast delivery,Must buy!,5
"I like it warm with light whipped cream.  Also, after a day in the fridge it gets a deeper chocolaty flavor, also good with light whipped cream.  Whipped cream not necessary, pudding still tastes great.  Sorry that it is so much chemical additives etc., but when I went low-sugar a few years ago, I gave in to the alternative sweeteners.  This product is more difficult to find in stores so buying a case from Amazon was my way of stocking up.",THANKS AMAZON - GREAT FOR DIABETICS IMO,5
I have been using it for several months and found that I like it better than gluten protein.  I take one heaping tablespoon in the morning with a scoop of flax meal and 1 or 2 tablespoons of steel-cut oat meal with a little milk.  That seems quite satisfying.,Good product and worth the money.,5

"I received my first bottle of this Viking Smoked Salt as a stocking stuffer. I like to cook and I started using it w/everything! I feel this really enhances the flavor of the veggies. It is especially delicious on roasted vegetables.<br /><br />1. Turn oven on to broil.<br />2. Prepare a baking pan with foil.<br />3. Lay out my veggies (asparagus, brussel sprouts, broccoli, etc) in a single layer.<br />4. Douse with extra virgin olive oil (evoo).<br />5. Sprinkle liberally with Viking Smoked Salt.<br />6. I sometimes add ground black pepper and ground garlic.<br />7. I leave the veggies in there till they start to get golden brown but I really like them kinda charred... About 8-14 mins.<br /><br />I have also used in sauteing vegetables (mushrooms, green beans, brussel sprouts, etc)<br /><br />1. Turn on stove to a medium high fire.<br />2. Prepare a large frying pan with evoo (just enough to cover the expanse of the pan).<br />3. When oil starts to separate, drop in vegetables.<br />4. Coat veggies w/oil from pan (add more if needed). I also sometimes add a few pats of butter for taste.<br />5. Sprinkle with Viking Smoked Salt.<br />6. Keep mixing the veggies.<br />7. I turn off the fire when the veggies are al dente(still a little bit crisp) but that is up to you...",Delicious! Vegetable Enhancer!,5

"If you like coffee with a little cream and sugar, don't miss these wonderful little treats.  They give the coffee a warm rounded flavor of almost brown sugar, but mellower.  It is simply a wonderful indulgence. I have a cup mid-morning (otherwise no sugar), and it makes the coffee more of an interlude than a ""break"".  When times are tough, small indulgences are important - so get some!",YUMMMMM,5

"I have used this conditioner for two weeks now. I am very picky about conditioner. I have very long and fine hair that tends to be dry and flyaway at times. This conditioner moisturizes well and also leaves a wonderful smell to your hair. I have noticed it is east to comb my hair when I get out of the shower.<br /><br />The best thing is the summer has been very hot and humid and most conditioners leave my hair flyaway. The moisture this provides leaves my hair soft and not flyaway. At night it smells good still and so soft to the touch!<br /><br />I have been using it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>.

"Having always eaten the Honey Maid Graham Crackers... I was thrilled at being offered a more natural version to try.  I can sum up my experience in one word: Succulent! Wow!  What a great flavor!  You almost feel like you are eating a treat, and not a cracker!  So I took at a look at the ingredients and I was happy with what I found there too: all natural, simple ingredients (and ones that you KNOW what they are!).  If this is what a graham cracker is supposed to taste like, I've been jipped all these years!  I absolutely LOVE the oats in them too... it gives a nice crunch and I have to admit, I am a bit fan of oats in dry goods, so that definitely was a plus in my mind.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was better would be the price.  They are probably about 50% more expensive than the typical brands. But hey, who says I can't buy those ""other"" crackers for the kids (who could care less), and hide these on the top shelf for me?  :)","Wow, what a great flavor!!",5
Good design and qualilty.. The packaging was best.. Faster delivery as well..,Highly recommended,5

"I think the Grove Spiced Apple Cider K-Cups are absolutely delicious!<br /><br />I found the 8 oz. setting to be a bit too strong for me, so I used the 10 oz. setting on my brewer and, for me, the hot apple cider turns out perfect, just the way I want it.<br /><br />I have to watch my carbs, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that these K-Cups are only one carb each.  Before ordering, I noted that under ""Product Features"" it states that the product is sugar-free; and under ""Product Description"" it clearly states that the product is sweetened with aspartame.  Therefore, I think it's fair to say that those who prefer sugar over other sweeteners, and/or can't stand the taste of aspartame, may not care for this product.<br /><br />As for me, I enjoy it well enough that I've put it on monthly subscription.",Grove Spiced Apple K-Cups - Delicious!,5
"That said, if you do have little ones who just don't care much about eating breakfast, these are a godsend.  They taste fantastic and most kids love that apple/cinnamon combo.  Like eating applesauce in a breakfast bar.  Plus, they're getting the vitamins too so it's hard to miss with this one.  If you're an adult, you probably need two of these - they're fairly skimpy so they won't fill you up in the mornings.  But, they taste fantastic!  Recommend!",Great breakfast food for picky eaters!,5

"I love this stuff! I sprinkle some into the bottom of a cup I am about to brew green tea in, add a green tea teabag, sprinkle in a little stevia, add hot water, and enjoy! The green tea extract kicks up the green tea a notch or two (making the tea flavor more intense) and the stevia counteracts any bitterness making it nicely sweet without any calories ... just don't add too much, a little goes a long way (true both for the extract and the stevia).",I love this stuff!,5
"Once you try this gum, there is no turning back! I discovered this gum about 2 years ago and have not bought any other gum since. Try it and you will not be disappointed.

"This product has a few simple ingredients and delivers great flavor without the MSG you often find in other seasoned seaweed products. It's also free of soy sauce, which usually contains wheat, so it suits my gluten free diet.  I drink soy milk and take a supplement with soy isoflavones which tend to bind iodine, so the super boost of iodine in the seaweed is a great benefit for me.<br /><br />The seaweed sheets are crisp and we eat them like potato chips or sometimes we wrap them around warm rice. Make sure you have a napkin. The healthy oils on this seaweed can be a little messy on the hands.<br /><br />My kids love this stuff. - They were introduced to seaweed at a young age.

"My cat is VERY picky about what she will eat.  These are the only treats that gets her RUNNING.  Plus I love the fact that these are supposed to be good for her teeth too.  My dog also loves these treats but she'll only get one when I feel bad that she's doing tricks in front of me to get one while I'm treating the cat.<br /><br />I've tried a bunch of other cat treats with no success (turns up her nose at every one of them).  I bought the freeze-dried chicken treats and I thought I had another winner but after happily gulping up 4 or 5 over the course of a couple days my cat has had enough and now turns up her nose to them.  Not her greenies though, I've bought her the salmon, the chicken and the tuna and she loves all of them.  I've been giving her greenies for a couple of month now and she has yet to get sick of them, she's always jumping up begging for greenies and I have to hide the bags from her or it will be torn up and covered with teeth marks.<br /><br />Give these a try!

Finicky cat loves this flavor and stores locally do not stock it. She tends to leave many of the chunky bits but after having her turn her nose up and leave everything in her dish with other flavors it's clear she likes this cat food. Purchase it for her on the Amazon subscribe & save option so she always has plenty of cans available.  Subscribe and save price is a few cents over PetCo price but Amazon includes shipping and PetCo does not so Amazon comes out less expensive overall.,My cat loves it,5

"I don't know how Coffee Masters does it, but they consistently produce high-quality luscious beans without the bitter ""charred"" taste I find so prevalent in other brands (Starbucks, for example).<br /><br />This Breakfast Blend decaf is yet another winner: rich full flavor, just a bit ""tangier"" than their Mexican variety (my other favorite), outstanding!  I usually start the day with the Mexican, then brew a small pot of half-and-half Mexican and Breakfast Blend decaf at noon, and finish the day with a cup of decaf after supper.<br /><br />It took me a long time to find these outrageously good coffees -- I now have them on ""subscribe and save"" so I'll never run out!",Absolutely the best decaf coffee out there,5

"These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.",VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.,5

"I bought the Sodastream thinking that it would be the most brilliant thing ever. And then I tried the syrup flavors. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I mean, I regularly bought a flavored sparkling water drink that had zero calories and tasted amazing (the Sparkling ICE brand), so how difficult was it to put that in a syrup to add to carbonated water myself?<br /><br />This Diet Cranberry-Raspberry is as close as I've found to a great tasting, calorie-free, flavored sparkling water that I can make to order fresh at home. I always have at least three bottles of this on hand at a time for those moments when regular water just isn't enough and I'm craving something sweet with carbonation.<br /><br />There are so many ways to drink this as well. I like to mix natural fruit juice with carbonated water and a tiny bit of this to help keep it from tasting watered down. Even putting half the amount of syrup (or less!) than is called for is really good for that light, refreshing sort of taste. I've even added it to the coke mix when that was decidedly bad in an attempt at salvaging it and surprise, surprise. It was SO much better.<br /><br />This flavor completely saved my sodastream experience and I am so happy it did.",This flavor completely saved my Sodastream experience and I'm so happy it did,5

I started applying it not only as a diaper rash remedy but to his patches of eczema and it really helped.

He has never had a bad diaper rash, but the moment I see pink on his bottom I apply this cream and the pink is gone by the morning.  We have had a pretty brutal summer heat wise and I broke out in a heat rash on my legs (first time ever).

"Habe diese Sauce mehr per Zufall mal in einem Asia-Supermarkt mitgehen lassen. Ich war sehr &uuml;berrascht, da ich bisher nur die Tabasco-&auml;hnlichen Essigbasierten Hot-Sauces gewohnt war.

Daneben, und das ist das besondere, hat sie auch einen vollen (sie enth&auml;lt auch Senf), in Ankl&auml;ngen sehr fruchtigen Geschmack (das macht die verwendete Chilli-Sorte). Daher eignet sie sich f&uuml;r eine Vielzahl von Gerichten, denen sie den letzten Geschmacks- und Sch&auml;rfekick zu geben vermag.

"Period. When I started trying new teas, I kept coming back to PG. It's just the best. it doesn't have the ""malty"" flavor that others have, like Barry's or Yorkshire. Just pure tea goodness.",Nothing beats PG,5

This black garlic is incredibly delicious and good for you!  Sweet!<br />You can purchase a 5.5oz container of peeled black garlic from the manufacturer for $10.99 which is $2/oz and the price here on amazon of $68.35 for 16 ounces is $4.27/oz.  Usually Amazon offers great prices so I am wondering if this is a typo?  Maybe you get two 16oz packages????,DELICIOUS HEALTHY BLACK GARLIC,5

"I consider myself a candy connoisseur, and so many times have I've had cravings for something sweet yet nothing in the stores seemed to hit the spot. Keep in mind, the one type of candy I cannot stand is licorice. One day, my boyfriend saw a movie with his dad and the theater had a deal- buy one popcorn and soda and get a Kazoozles free. He brought it back home for me and not knowing it was licorice I tried a piece. I've finally found the candy my cravings were calling for! I can safely say this is the PERFECT candy!  It's soft, chewy, slightly tangy and the core is filled with what tasted to me like blue blended sweetarts. What's even better is the package says ""fat-free"" although I honestly don't see how something this delicious can be fat free...but if that's not true, then this candy is worth breaking any diet. The only bad thing about it is it's really hard to find! I had been looking anytime I stopped in a store, and one day I had a craving for it so bad that I even dreamed about it! I tried googling where it can be bought and quickly discovered the best option is to buy it in bulk online. I didn't order it from Amazon, at first because I found another website that sold the other flavor (cherry lemonade). This candy is AWESOME! I wanted to tell Wonka that they need to make this candy as available in stores as any other candy they sell. Wonka deserves an epic praise for making a candy that hits the spot!",The best candy ever,5

"This is a great habanero sauce, with really good flavor and a nice level of heat. It's not just hot for hot's sake. There are plenty of much more fiery sauces for true capsaicin fanatics and macho guys trying to impress party-goers. But don't underestimate the kick. If you think Tabasco Sauce (also a favorite for Cajun) is hot, be careful with El Yucateco. I love this stuff!","Great Taste, Nice Heat",5

"I really love this salt.  Not a strong taste and it doesn't overwhelm foods.  Just adds a nice, clean flavor.  Also a beautiful color.  Always a conversation starter when I put it on the table.<br /><br />Be advised that the pieces are rather large and the salt itself is ""dense"" rather than ""crumbly"" so you will need to have a good quality mill.  Our Oxo mill handles it fine, but I did try a lever-operated mill--no luck.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.2 pound bag (a kilo) costs the same as the two pound bag.  Why would anyone not buy the kilo package?",Excellent,5
I have to buy this dog food for my Dashound because of allergies to food. This is the only dry dog food I have been able to find that will not cause him to break out with bumps. Beside he loves it.

If you love Girl Scout Thin Mints you will crave these little gems.  I am not a huge sweet fan but I could eat the entire box in one sitting.  The downside is I think you can only get them during the holidays.  Not sure if I will make it until then!,Addictive little cookie,5
I had to pull an all-nighter but I hate the huge cans of energy drinks (sometimes they make me go to sleep). I saw the commercial for this product on tv and decided to try it out. The berry flavor's not too bad-it tastes like liquified smarties. I also liked the fact that it promises that you won't crash (I had several classes and work the following day) and that it's only 4 calories. The no-refrigeration is also handy when you only want to drink half of the bottle.<br /><br />I drank a whole bottle after deciding that half wouldn't give me enough juice to stay up. I did start feeling it after a couple of minutes and I actually lasted for about 8 more hours before I started feeling drowsy. There was no crash and I didn't feel any bad effects. I definitely recommend this to anyone and plan on using it again.,Amazing strength at such a small size,5

"Ramune is the Japanese version Lemonade, and it is a really nice drink, if you can get the glass ball to move away from the opening without spraying yourself with your drink. If you have been sprayed once too often, but love the taste, perhaps you should try this candy.<br /><br />I am pretty addicted to the stuff, and eat them 3 or 4 at a time. I enjoy just letting them sit in my mouth with that fizzy taste. They really taste quite a lot like ramune should. Sucking on some ramune candy is nice way to pass time reading, actually. They are quite refreshing.<br /><br />These candies are not hard, and quite chewable for those who prefer that.<br /><br />For anyone looking for a candy that is not over-the-top sweet, give Ramune Soda Candy a shot. It is a nice candy and makes a great snack. Even the container looks like a ramune bottle.",Genuine Taste!,5
"I have been using this stuff for 2 months and I absolutely love it for cooking.  I also use it for my body, face and hair.  Not sure about all the healthy hype but it is a must try product.  You do have to get use to the consistency depending on the weather it could be in a liquid form or hard.  It is a great moisturizer I have very dry skin, after 2-3 minutes you no longer feel oily and the slight smell of coconut also disappears.  I do moisturize before I go to bed not sure if I would do it in the morning before I get dress for work, I would be worried it might ruin my clothes.

"I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet. His advice? Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!",Saw this on Dr. OZ for eliminating crows feet,5
"I use coconut oil for many different things:<br /><br />1. My hair: it is very moisturizing and gives me soft, silky hair like no other product has ever given me before. I've used other oils on my hair before (such as extra virgin olive oil), but coconut oil is the best. It is the only oil that can penetrate the hair shaft.<br /><br />2. My skin: coconut oil moisturizes my skin very well. It is also a very good makeup remover. I use coconut oil on any dry spots on my skin, but I do not use it on my face. While many people have no problems using coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, it can be a problem for someone with acne prone skin.<br /><br />3. Cooking: coconut oil is great for cooking. It adds a really great flavor to a bowl of oatmeal. I sometimes even add some into my coffee. I've made cookies and bars with coconut oil and have had great results.",Very versatile,5

"Growing up my cats were raised on grocery store pet food that, upon opening a can, was unrecognizable as food. It just looked like a oozing brown sponge of muck. And it would come with the most horrendous smell that seemed closer to manure than food. Tiki Cat is nothing like that. When I open the can I both recognize the fishy parts and it smells like seafood. There's also plenty of gravy, which my cats lap up. Even though I've mainly switched them to a raw food diet, there's always the once in awhile morning or evening where the raw food hasn't thawed yet or some other mishap. It's good to have quality canned cat food my cats love as a back up.<br /><br />The first ingredient is water. The second is fish, which is good for pet food. They're always ordered by the largest quantity first. It always amazes me when I pick up cat food that doesn't have meat listed first or second. Cats are carnivores! Meat should be the largest percentage of their diet, not grain. I love this pack has a ton of different varieties of fish, not just tuna or salmon, so that my cats get more diversity and nutrients in their diet.",Food you can recognize,5

"Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is different than other ""drizzled"" or dipped or coated popcorn I have tasted in the past.  It seems to have just the right amount of fudge and caramel so as to not turn it into a cookie or on the skimpy side a dusted corn pop.  I liked it and would probably look to buy it in the future.  Just one packet satisfied my evening desert appetite with only 130 calories.  Went well with my cup of tea.",Different,5

Have been taking it since mid 2002 and have been extremely happy with it.  It might not have the same effect on everyone but if I miss a day - I don't feel as peppy and normal.  One of my (good) side effects has been that mosquitos don't eat me alive any more.  I have seen them fly right past me.  In 9 years - I have had maybe 3 bites versus being chewed up all the time most of my life.  Even when I used Skin-so-soft lotion - they bit me on my head.  Thinking that Sea Aloe has changed my smell and they aren't attracted to me as much.  My skin color is better than ever and I do think it helps me sleep better too since I have more energy during the day.  Great stuff that everyone should try for a couple months to see if they have good results too.  Swear that my hair even shines more now.,Love Sea Aloe,5

"I'm on a restrictive diet and was shopping amazon for deals on almonds. I began to wonder what almond butter tasted like, and rather than whip the old Vita-mix out of the cupboard, I bought these individual packets, which are great to slip in a purse or hide at work in a file marked ""Old Accounting Forms."" I couldn't be more pleased with the taste - richer and deeper than I expected.  It's remarkable enough to think about telling my friends about while being reluctant to share any packets. I can't wait to try this brand in a spicy thai sauce.  This is a also great way to try this product without dropping the $30 on 3 jars without knowing if you like it.",Delicious!,5

"Margarita mix is expensive and usually laden with calories (well, alcohol is too!). I don't drink a lot of alcohol, but when I do, I almost always order Mojitos, Margaritas, or Sour Apple martinis. I love the taste of them and thus the alcohol taste isn't overpowering for me.<br /><br />Therefore I was delighted to discover these new Crystal Light mocktails in my local grocery store (about three bucks a canister). The Crystal Light Margarita mix tastes just like Jose Cuervo Margarita mix to me, even the slight salty tang. This one and the Mojito are so good all on their own and I love them. The Appletini is a bit too much like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy, so I only like that one in small doses. They are obviously not as syrupy-thick as real Margarita mix, but that's a plus to me. It's very refreshing on a hot summer day.<br /><br />Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes 2 quarts. An 8 oz glass of this is a no-guilt 5 calories. It's great both as an option for non-drinkers and to add alcohol too if you wish. I've been back to the store several times now and they don't have these any more - when I bought them they were marked ""temporary"".  So now this is the only place I know to get them.","Refreshing, and very similar to Jose Cuervo Margarita mix!",5

The flavoring is pleasant, not overwhelming and the tea itself is caffeine free so it's a great late evening/relaxing drink.  I even used these to make iced tea and that was very good as well.

"My cat is 13 years old and didn't move around as well as he used to. A friend of mine had great results taking human glucosamine and chondroitin supplements. We looked at the natural supplements available- and there was no way that my cat was going to let me give him pills everyday, unless I wanted to be shredded and bit(he is a bit feisty about meds). These treats, given only 3 small ones a day are the perfect answer. He will jump on my lap to get to these, he loves them (and he is kinda picky). He does seem to be moving a lot better these days.",Great for older cars that need the benefit of Glucosamine & chondroitin,5
"I work with a 501(c)3 non-profit cat rescue (fostering sick cats until they are well enough to go to forever homes).  I recently took in a kitty that someone had locked in their basement without food or water and left to die.  You could see every bone in her body.  While she was totally starving, convincing her to eat, or move, or drink, or clean herself was difficult.  I tried a variety of cat foods, but the only thing I could get her to eat was really expensive tuna from whole foods.  Then I tried Tiki Cat.  She loves it.  And I love it because it has the nutrition she needs (which plain tuna doesn't).  It is on the pricey side, but it is worth it for nutritious food that will save this kitties life.  I just ordered a 72-pack on Amazon - because buying it one can at a time at my local cat food store was getting pricey.",amazing cat food,5

"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.",These will be habit forming!,5

"My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor. Don't go cheap on the popcorn and you will never buy microwave popcorn again. Great Northerns 6 oz popcorn bag comes premeasured and you will never have to add salt or additional butter to get the movie taste that we are all after. Plus the upside, unlike movie popcorn where you go to that giant butter machine,squirt that liquid death over the top part of yor popcorn only to find that it never reaches the bottom of the bag. This has the same great taste without making you feel like a short order cook at McDonalds and each kernal taste just like the first. I am a part time chef (fulltime banker:)), I will never buy any other popcorn product again after eating this.

"PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!",The best chips EVER!,5
"This is, as all of their cereals I've ordered so far are fresh, high quality, and wonderful tasting cereals. The only downside is since the ingredients are so dense, the packages are small, but a serving size is only 2/3 cup-honestly I eat more than that as one serving though. The best value for this brand is the 21 oz. Swiss Crunch which is heavenly w/ assorted grains, coconut, hazelnuts, and raisins. I caution you IF you eat this item dry as a snack, premeasure it or you will find you have consumed the entire 11 oz. bag without realizing it-yes, it's that good!","Crunchy, tastes great & is healthy!",5
"I really like to use coconut oil for baking. It produces a much lighter end product than shortening does, and it's much better for you. Also, surprisingly, there's no heavy coconut taste. For health purposes, I also stir a teaspoonful into my coffee in the morning. Nutiva Coconut Extra-Virgin Oil works just fine. My only gripe: unlike with olive oils, as far as I know, there's no such thing as EXTRA virgin coconut oil. It's the same thing as virgin coconut oil. I suppose they label it that way for marketing purposes, but I never like to promote a myth. In any case, Nutiva works in every way that I expect it to, and buying the 54 ounce jar of Nutiva is the most economical way that I have found to buy it.","Coconut oil fan, here",5

"That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff!

"I decided to switch my cat's food because she was having all kinds of problems:  excessive throwing up, urinary tract issues, and significant weight loss that the vet couldn't explain.  I switched her from Kirkland dry and Friskies Turkey Pate canned to Wellness dry and Wellness chicken formula, and it's been almost an overnight miracle.  She's put on at least a pound in 3 weeks (she eats an entire 5.5 oz can plus dry food every day--no more pushing the food around and not really eating), no more straining on the litter box, and she hasn't barfed in over a week!  I'm really impressed at what a difference this food has made for my cat's health.","Expensive, but my cat is thriving on it",5
"We recently received a Jack Russell terrier from a man who couldn't take the dog with him to where he was moving. As thanks, we got all of the dog's toys, treats, a bed, and...a big bag of Pedigree. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Pedigree's ""Adopt a Shelter Dog"" campaign, as it's great publicity for the millions of dogs in our local shelters that need a good home. But the ingredient list is pretty lousy, and it's something I think a working class dog like the Jack could do without. So we ordered him a big bag of Taste of the Wild, a company I'm already familiar with through their cat food line. For the week or so he's been eating it, I can already see a noticeable improvement in his hunger alone--he used to gingerly pick up pieces of Pedigree kibble and crunch them down as if saying ""Meh, it's food, Kind of."" After the second or so bowl of TOTW, he flies face first into his bowl like a heat-seeking missile, and scarfs down his reward so quickly you'd think he hadn't eaten for days! The ingredient list is pretty top notch--the first three ingredients are bison, lamb meal, and venison, which is a ridiculously great indulgence considering the stuff that passes for dog food these days. (Now, if they could only get a similar meat profile for their cat food, and cut down on the sweet potato...but that is another review.)<br /><br />Two things to note, though: this food is rich, with a much higher level of protein and fat than your dog may be used to. The first few days my dog ate it, his stools were almost liquid, and I had to do a Pedigree-TOTW mix just to be able to not have a nasty mess happen when walking him. I recommend you do the same, especially if your dog is transitioning off of a heavy corn/filler-based food. From what I've read about the fat, it's good for both your dog's coat conditions and energy levels, but if you have a little couch potato dog who doesn't mind not running for days on end, I might urge you to consider something a little less extreme. But for big, strong and active dogs, this food's definitely a winner. It's a touch pricey, but 30 lbs of food for one 20+ lb dog? I'd say it works out pretty well, at least in this household.","My Jack Russell says ""YES!"" Or ""arf,"" I guess..",5

The tea is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, with each sip lending itself naturally into the next.  Because it's a white tea, there are very low tannins.  And the tea bags themselves are fun.

There is a definite difference in taste, compared to the hemp oil in a glass bottle.  I much prefer the taste of the hemp oil in a glass bottle.<br /><br />Keep this organic oil refrigerated after you open the bottle.<br /><br />I use it on salads.  I do not use it for frying or sauteing.<br /><br />I've learned that any oil at high heat becomes a transfat...yes, that evil transfat. I now only use ghee (clarified butter) or organic coconut oil for any frying or any baking.  Every other oil I use, (hemp, olive, walnut, avocado) I use only for seasoning or in salads.<br /><br />This product was shipped to me exceptionally well-packaged and securely wrapped.  Each bottle was individually wrapped and cushioned in bubble wrap, within a box that was additionally cushioned all around in more bubble wrap. Perfect.<br /><br />When I run out, I will certainly buy this product from the same Seller who gave excellent customer service.","BEST PRICE, IN GLASS BOTTLES",5

"Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.",Best in Class Dry Dog Food,5

"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product.  When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom.  Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%",NO waste at all--- all dogs love liver treats--- great for training!,5

"This tea has exquisite taste to it. Unlike the green tea bags available in most grocery stores this is real compressed tea leaves and they look and brew green! Yes, the leaves look greenish in color and brews sparkling green tea.

"And I gotta say......I like it!  I did a lot of research on coconut water before I purchased.  Zinco brand seemed to get better reviews, and people saying it actually has ALOT more electrolytes etc.  I have heard the benefits of drinking this versus Gatorade etc and wanted one that didn't taste like crap.  This is chocolate flavored.  Well , anything chocolate in my book is a winner.  the product arrived fast, and was packaged very well. I put a few in the refrigerator and in a couple hours, I tried one.  It didn't gag, or spit it out. It actually has a once taste to it.  Kinda like watered down chocolate milk.  Didn't taste any coconut flavor, just chocolate.  It filled me up, and seemed to make me have a little energy,  I plan on using these as after workout drinks, or even after too much  indulging in the wine, I think these would help!  Lol.

The tea leaves are intact, not the kind of broken leaves you often get from low-quality stuff. Remember not to use boiling water.

So I drank a 5-Hour ENERGY® and never gave my tiredness a second thought! I felt naturally alert and energized like the night had just began. If I had chosen an energy drink instead, I would have felt jittery and bloated due to the carbonation in the drink. Just a little sip is all I needed. I would definitely buy this again!  FYI, I also snacked on a banana at the same time.

"FIRST -- Let me tell you that I am the type of person who -- while not fat, does need to be aware of weight issues and watch calories.  A woman reaches an age where even a former skinnywinny has to do that.  And I am a former skinnywinny who used to eat the entire bread basket and ask for more at a restaurant before the meal even arrived. I love bread. . . all kinds of bread.  And I hate having to limit how much I eat of it these days. So, three cheers (or 30) to Wegman's food for producing the only product I've ever found to satisfy my craving for bread -- and for ONLY 16 calories per slice . . .er, per ""popcake.""  I've tried Ak-Mok, flat bread, pita bread, Ry-Krisp, home-baked, wheat thins, salt-rising, oat bread, seven-grain, organic, beer bread, sour dough, high-fiber/low fat bread, Trader Joe's mini-muffins, the 45-calorie slices one of the bakeries puts out, hi-fiber low-cal white tortillas (which aren't horrible) . . . but this stuff ACTUALLY DOES quench my bread cravings with minimum calories and maximum satisfaction.  Forget those puffed rice cakes! Yeeccchhh! Like eating styrofoam.  Plus, they crumble all over the place.  But these are heaven.  I cannot get enough. Or, rather, I CAN get enough to satisfy me so that I do not have to stuff my face on actual bread. Maybe it's the shape. They're about the size of a tortilla, only puffy. Texture is similar to the rice cakes, except for the ""mouthfeel,"" (I understand this is a technical term that professional food tasters use, ha ha!). These feel a little ""slick"" in your mouth, which is so much better than rice cakes and, somehow, they are not as dry. They're a little ""glossy"" on the tongue, not ""matte"" and flat.<br /><br />You can cut them in half and put sandwich spread on them, such as tuna fish, or diet mayo, cucumber, and thin slices of lunch meat or roast beef, or ham and mustard.  Then cover them with the other half and you have a sandwich! With only 16 calories of bread!  Or, you can even eat peanut butter and jelly.  IT's easy to spread them with tub/bin-style margarines or butter substitutes... Or, even whipped butter if you want to pig out.  Or, eat them with a thin trail of honey drizzled over them.<br />However you use bread, you can use these (except for French toast -- I'm sure that would NOT work.)  I have not put them into the toaster yet, but I might try it on low at some point. (They might shrivel or burn fast . . .I don't know.  But my instincts tell me they'd be okay on the ""low"" setting, and just get brown and even tastier. I love to put soft boiled eggs on them with salt substitute and pepper, though I boil the eggs until the yolk has thickened a little and isn't really too runny anymore because if you put really wet things on these, the liquid WILL bleed through and drop on your blouse or something.  I would NOT put pickle relish on them (too wet), or tomatoes (unless I covered the ""popcake"" with a layer of mayo, butter, or a big, wide lettuce leaf).  I did eat them with a pretty runny egg once and the egg dripped out through a soaked crack in the popcake.<br /><br />I think the thing I love most about them is that, while they are mostly AIR, they actually TASTE like yeasty bread.  And they are really crisp.<br />I can eat a whole one during the afternoon -- either along with shaved carrots and Laughing Cow lite cheese, or with a piece of low-fat, or no-fat cheese and cucumber and mustard or lite mayo.  It's flavor, plus texture...  I suppose if I sprayed them with butter spray, and sprinkled them with that yellow ""popcorn salt"" that you can buy in some grocery stores, I could sneak about 7 of them into the theater in my purse and be very happy guzzling them down and pigging out on them for about 112 calories.  That would get me through a movie... ha, ha.  I could have my ""popcake"" and eat it too!  Normally I do not go on and rave about products.  And I realize it's a matter of personal taste.  Some people might find them a bit styrofoamy due to their airy texture.  But I am so grateful to have found a substitute for bread that actually has that ""bready"" taste, something that I can use for sandwiches (which I love) and still feel satisfied, that I am celebrating the crispy texture rather than complaining about missing that yielding, semi-moist texture and fragrance of fresh-baked bread. I feel like I've just gone to Marshall's and bought a Ralph Lauren Black Label Evening Gown that fits great and looks like dynamite for only $10.99.  If you have to buy $30 worth of these, or 10 of them, to qualify to purchase them online, I believe you will not regret getting so many UNLESS THEY GET STALE DURING SHIPPING.  I would not know about that.  I got mine at Whole Foods in Massachusetts.  Not sure if they're available on the West Coast -- I've not ever seen them there.  And never at a standard grocery store like Ralph's, Von's, Safeway, Market Basket, Albertson's, or other chains.  Just Whole Foods, though some of the other artisan-style foodstores might -- just might -- carry them.  You might check the actual Coco foods site by doing a search engine search.  Anyway, I think this is one of the best diet aids EVER! Hope this helps.  And no, I do not work for the company or have any relatives working for them.  I usually am a bit critical of products.",So far this is the ONLY product that satisfies my craving for bread,5

This pasta dish is amazing!  Very easy to prepare and tastes very fresh because the noodles are not boiled until you make it.  It is also very filling because the pasta is made from whole wheat and high in fiber.  The sauce is extremely tasty and not at all like a typical convenience food.

"Because I'm a vegetarian it's a little tricky getting those highly touted omega-3s in my diet so I'm always happy to find food source that does the job.  This tasty granola contains flax seeds (hence the omega-3s) and a veritable cornucopia of whole grains including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, brown rice and buckwheat, but no wheat so it's gluten-free.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  It does have evaporated cane juice and molasses, but a one third cup serving only has 6 grams of sugar. That same serving size has 5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, 130 calories and only 3.5 grams of fat and 20 mg of sodium so unless you overdo it, and because it is delicious that's possible, it's a guilt-free food.  It's great straight out of the bag, or with milk or (my favorite) yogurt.  There are several other flavors and they all sound good so I know I'll be checking them out too.  Since there's no honey or dairy I believe this would be good for vegans.",A tasty treat with omega-3s for all,5

Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!,radtechmom,5

"These are the most addictive cookies on the market.  They are Very rich, Ultimately delicious, and far to difficult to find in stores.  I got hooked on them in 1963 and have never looked back.  Because they are so rich with shortening and butter, chocolate chips and everything else that is not on your diet, they are prone to a short shelf-life.  Since they are Primarily a wedding cookie and most weddings notoriously occurr in June, I am going to offer my assumption that they are manufactured to be at their optimum during this part of the year.  The hazard of this is, the heat of the summer is detrimental to their shelf life, most notably, their appearance, regarding the white powdered sugar.  I have never found their taste to falter or disappoint me in spite of this.  As I mentioned in another post; you can re-coat the cookies with about a half cup of Powdered Sugar per box, and they will look like new.  I noticed they are rated at 80 calories per serving........ a serving being one cookie !  Get Real Folks !  Forget the calories, to a cookie lover, the serving size on these little bites of heaven are a minimum of one bag per person and that is only if someone is watching you eat.  Plan your weddings etc well ahead of time and order these cookies the earlier, the better.  order them in January or February and keep them in a cool place ready for the occasion,  I have even been known to freeze them.  I think you will find no problems with them at all doing this.  Got Milk ?",Best Cookie Keebler Makes,5
"I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

"Dark chocolate and berries is one of my favorite flavor combinations.  I have a weakness for healthy snacks like granola and trail mix.  Except they aren't so healthy when you finish a whole bag in a single day, a handful here, a handful there.  I decided to avoid doing that with the Love Crunch Granola by treating it like cereal.<br /><br />I served myself 1/3 cup of granola (which is more than a serving) and poured a little 1% milk on it.  It's perfect!  There is a good balance of smaller crumbles and larger chunks in the chocolate-flavored granola.  The dark chocolate squares and dried berries are just right ... enough to be savored without overpowering the granola.  The granola stays crunchy in the milk without being difficult to chew. (I have TMJ and sometimes crunchy granolas are hard and bother my jaw.)<br /><br />It was a decadent snack and I will enjoy the bag.  Hopefully I can savor it over the course of several days and don't give into my compulsion to sneak handfuls throughout the day.

"These bars are very different from the other non gluten-free Nature Valley granola bars so it's important to set the proper expectations. It's hard to describe, but essentially these bars are just nuts bound together with some sort of sugary honey binding. As you can imagine it makes these bars extremely crunchy and somewhat hard on your teeth unless you break them apart in your hand first. Once you get past this challenge you'll find the bar to be delicious and very filling since it's basically just nuts. The nutrition info can be a little misleading because all of the calories/fat come directly from the nuts which isn't a bad thing. These are definitely worth trying out and we're finding that they are in more and more supermarkets these days.",Finally a truly gluten free bar from Nature Valley,5
"The cashew and almond bar is very tasty. I eat these whenever I am hungry and want a healthy snack.

"This review is based on brewing with a Keurig using a reusable plastic kcup. I use a Keurig for my morning coffee on work days because it's fast and can make a decent strong cup with the right brand k-cup, like Emeril's Bold. Since I've been wanting to try Marley's coffee anyway, I thought I'd get these pods, open one, and pour the contents into the reusable plastic kcup that I bought on Amazon. And it worked!<br /><br />This coffee, when brewed as above in a Keurig on the medium cup size, produces a deep, rich, robust cup of coffee heaven. There's no bitterness,  just smooth, rich, deep flavor with a slight acidic tingle. It's not the blend for someone who likes light to medium blends. This is for the stout-hearted coffee drinkers only. I plan on buying a bag of beans and brewing them in my regular Cloer coffeemaker.",Robust coffee heaven in a cup (made with a Keurig),5

"I tried this, and liked it- now I am loving it!<br /><br />I have bought all the flavors, and prefer Fruit Punch, Strawberry, and Sweet Tea the most.  The flavor is not for the shy - a little goes a LONG way. In some ways, it IS similar to Crystal Light, which I have enjoyed for decades ( For those mature enough to remember, that product was launched with Linda Evans, at the time, Dynasty's ""Krystal""... Crystal Light is also a KRAFT product).<br /><br />MiO is easier to use, and has better color, and is super-easy to transport- to the office, to the gym, where ever you might be. The fruit punch reminds me of a popsicle at a theme park ( in my case 60's and 70's!). Needless to say, a very positive memory!<br /><br />So far, I have used it in regular and sparkling water, and enjoyed it.  Have also used it with a SodaStream unit, with excellent results.  But the best is with crushed ice - much like a ""Sno-Cone"" -beyond GOOD!  Just put it in a personal, or regular size blender, add some ice, and 30 seconds later - a refreshing treat! PERFECT after a workout, a run, or just a long day.<br /><br />(okay, I admit, one could add a dash of vodka to that as well, for an evening event....yum!)","Handy, and tastes great, excellent with crushed ice",5

"We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!",Thank God I found this food!,5

"....but I was WRONG. Wow! I am normally just a plain old soap kind of guy. I don't really care much for anything too smelly, and the body washes I have tried (received as a gift or used in a resort) have left me feeling that I would never want to try a body wash. Either I got hives (yes, that happened with H20 brand), or it just left a film. Well, Dove Men + Care is a different story. It smells good, not just nice, but really good....and my wife likes it, too, she said, ""It has a manly smell."" I'm not sure what that means, but it was said in a positive way, so that's good with me. It also rinses off easily, and my skin did actually feel softer without feeling filmy. As for the ""smell,"" it's a crisp aroma, not musky and not woodsy. If you can imagine what ""clean"" ice would smell like (if there were such a thing), that is as close as I can get. It is not an overpowering aroma at all. Lastly, the container is perfect. It stands upside down very nicely and allows gravity to keep it at the dispensing end, which is great. As for value, well, I believe there is some value here. Each of these are fairly large, and should last for a while, so for the price, you are getting quite a lot.

"I found Violet Crumble in a shop about 25 miles from home one time. I always look for new taste treats, and this one looked interesting. They charged $1 per par, so I only bought one. If I had known how great it is, I would've bought five. It tastes amazing and the way it feels in your mouth and the way it crunches is also amazing. It's somewhat similar to a malted milk ball in consistency, but far far better tasting. It's pretty special. The flavor is kind of like coffee. I think everyone should try these at least once. I will definitely order a case of 24 of them sometime. They don't sell these in any stores near me as far as I know, and I would hate to drive 25 miles and go through some nightmare parking hassles just to get a candy bar. I really need to find a good candy shop near me if there is one, because I'm really tired of the same old ordinary, boring, low grade American candies at the supermarket.

That was really good and different. The bread by itself was very good, also and was not stale like I was afraid it would be. I would highly recommend this for Passover and for diabetics.

The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.

"This is like hot sauce concentrate.  You MUST dilute it to use it.  Do not try to eat this stuff straight or you will be miserable for hours, and then some.  Lets just say it burns both ways.  A teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible, and I like very hot and spicy foods.  Five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish.  Tabasco isn't even comparable to this, because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot.  This is truly the hotest sauce I have ever had, I think it killed my tastebuds (slight sarcasm).<br /><br />Wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid.  If you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time, and I would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience.<br /><br />The first listed ingredient is habaneros.","Hot sauce concentrate, use at your own risk",5

"was in line at Petsmart and the man in front of me was buying Bil Jac dog food. That was about 6 years ago. I asked him about it because I had never heard of it. He happened to be a Scientist who had been on a dog food study team and said it was the best of all they rated. I have 12 toy poodles ( I use to breed them) and this dog food they all loved immediately. The best part is it is the only small kibble I have found that isn't so hard. I have tried so many of the more expensive, better brands and they always turned their noses up at it, but would eventually, reluctantly, eat it. Bil Jac crumbles more easily for these little guys. For Picky eaters as well. It works well with dogs who have teeth problems and older dogs as well as it does not hurt their teeth to break the kibble. In a pinch I have had to buy other food for them and they never like it. The other kind I had to soak in water before feeding them because it was so hard. I promise your dogs will love this food and it's so good for them too. I have always let my dogs ""graze"" ( I am a big believer of that) and leave food down all the time and they never over eat with this or get fat. Normal BM's too.

"The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.",great alternative to bottled green tea,5

"I grew up with Salt Licorice and love it, especially the Double Salts. It is definitely an acquired taste though. I wouldn't recommend starting with a double salt and start with a button, farm animals, or cats. I have had friends try it several time in my life and not one liked it with their first try, however if they stick with it and try it a few times it grows on them to a point where they like it a great deal. Now whenever I have some they all want some of my stash.",Love it!,5
"This coffee, along with the vanilla biscotti flavored under the same lines, tastes amazing! I love the frangrance that it leaves behind in the house while brewing! The flavor is very robust--drinking it straight is a treat, but mixed with creme and/or sugar was really good too! I suggest getting this coffee at this price , it comes out to about 3.80 a bag with the promo right now...cant be beat!","Lovely Flavor, Sweet smell!",5

"I placed an order for this organic chocolate on a Thursday in July. Immediately after placing the order I realized what a mistake. It's way too hot in July to be mailing chocolate and, it's just before the weekend so it will sit in a hot warehouse all weekend. The chocolate just arrived, and they did an amazing job of packing it. The chocolate was insulated, with an ice pack (melted) outside of that, all wrapped in another insulation wrap, surrounded by packing material and a box. And it is not melted at all. Amazing.<br />Thanks Trade Concepts. I hope I didn't give any secrets away.",These guys really know how to ship,5
"Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.",Best in Class Dry Dog Food,5
"You'd think it'd be fairly simple, you order 6"" bully sticks, you get 6"" bully sticks...that seems to be the exception though and luckily Shadow River is that exception.  They are honest about what they are advertising and send you exactly what you bought, 6"" bully sticks.  So many other bully stick sellers on Amazon advertise 6"" and send you 4"" instead, others advertise ""thick"" and just take hollowed out ones that make them look thick and send to you when there's actually less to it than a regular bully stick.  I'm glad to have finally found a company who is reliable, honest and fair.  I will be buying my bully sticks from you every time now.  Thank you Shadow River for being the exception!!!","Finally, a seller who actually sends what it advertised!!!",5

"I was making fabric bags filled with flax seed and various smells to use in the microwave or freezer. I wanted a lavender bag and a peppermint/eucalyptus. After a bunch of looking around, I decided to try this one.<br /><br />When it came, I was shocked at the amount. For some reason I was expecting a couple handfuls, and got several dozen handfuls. When I was sifting through it, I noticed how fresh it looked, even dried, and the smell was wonderful. I mixed it in with the eucalyptus from the same company (and same great quality) and put that with the flax in the bag. It didn't take much to make it smell good (about a tablespoon of each per cup of flax). After being used again and again in the microwave, it still smells like it did the first day. I'm very pleased with the quality, and plan on buying only this brand in the future.<br /><br />Even the room I store it in smells fabulous.<br /><br />If looking for the same great mix, I recommend both herbs from Frontier.",Not just for tea,5
"As the other reviewer said, you should watch out for weather.  But regardless, I think most people like chocolate, somewhat mushy or not.  What to say? It tastes like Lindt chocolate, rich, creamy, dark, melt-in-your-mouth.  This is a great gift for a chocolate lover, or a great box to take into work or school and share with your colleagues.  Everyone will be your friend :)<br /><br />However, if you lack self-control, please refrain from buying this, and get the smaller packs with around 20 inside. Though it may be more expensive per ounce, you do NOT need to gain your weight in chocolate.",It's Lindt!,5

"Ultimate cheeseburger skillets dinner is a perfect dinner fix for my family.  It is easy, convenient, quick, and at the same time, it is something that is filling and tasty for them.  Sometimes I don't have time to make a thorough home-cooked meal, but this is just about as good as home-cooked.  It is just as hardy, but without all the extra hard work that a totally home cooked meal would take.  This is a lot quicker, but without the sacrifice.<br /><br />My family loves this cheeseburger skillet dinner.  Needless to say, it got eaten very quickly.

"I will say that I was a bit skeptical when I first got the coffee pods, having tried several, various other pods in the past that were less than what anyone would expect for the price. However, to my pleasant surprise, the Marley Coffee was VERY GOOD. It has a very organic taste to it, with slight floral overtones and a smooth finish, no bitter aftertaste. I use the pods in my SENSEO coffee machine and the pods work quite well with it, producing a glorious crema every time. I would recommend this coffee, especially to owners of the SENSEO. Marley Coffee is good stuff!",excellent coffee,5
"I was slightly worried when ordering because all the pictures shown of the ""pack of 12 tins"" were actually pictures of a pack of 6 tins.  But I trusted the words over the pictures and did receive packs of 12 tins (double what the photo shows).<br /><br />I bought packs of 12 tins in four different flavors, because I've found Altoids taste better when they are a different flavor than whatever flavor Altoid I had last.  Local stores have only the peppermint, which I like least.  The Spearmint and Wintergreen are surprisingly different from each other and from peppermint.  Spearmint is my favorite, closely followed by Cinnamon.  I like the Liquorish primarily for being so different from other flavors.<br /><br />Buying in bulk just saved a few cents vs. a local store price.  I bought in bulk because the multiple flavors are available and the packaging keeps it fresh a lot longer than it takes for me to finish them.",Altoid flavors I can't find in local stores,5

"I love Nescafe Gold because it's a light roast, plus they extract the tannins from it in the processing so overall you get less bitterness and it doesn't irritate the stomach like regular coffee does. I have stomach problems and other coffees really irritate my stomach, including Nescafe Original. I have found that Gold doesn't bother my stomach at all when dissolved in a mugful of hot milk. I can even drink it without breakfast in the morning! So yeah, nice flavor and a very mild-tasting, stomach-friendly coffee, if that's what you want. Too bad it's hard to find in the US and you have to order and pay shipping... But it's all over Europe (where I grew up) and I miss it, so I order it through Amazon.<br /><br />P.S.

"I have two litter mates.  One can eat anything with no problem.  The other always vomits ten minutes after eating, no matter what she eats: canned or dried makes no difference and I've tried every store brand there is.  Hairball treatments had no effect.  I figured ""cats throw up"" and didn't worry about it.  When I moved and switched vets the new vet asked if the cats ever threw up.  When she heard about the one cat she said cats do NOT just throw up and told me to get the Science Diet sensitive stomach food.  Yes, it's 4x the price of what I'd been buying, but I noticed a difference with the first bowl.  Instead of throwing up ten minutes after literally every meal, now she throws up maybe once a month.  If only I'd switched to this brand years ago we both would have been saved a lot of misery.  Even tho it costs more I've noticed that the bag seems to last longer than the same amount of cat chow did.",wish I'd started using it 5 years ago,5

Sad when people order something they don't know and then give it a bad review!  Double salt (tastes exactly as it is described) is an acquired taste!  You work your way up to it- you don't start at it.<br />So in all fairness those bad reviews should be ignored.

"Guayaki Mate Chocolatte is an absolutely wonderful blend! The tea is aromatic and has a mediumish body. The cocoa and spices are blended perfectly... neither overpowers one or another, yet both are prominent and easy to pick up on. The mate is more subtle, however, yet still present. Connoisseurs of mate tea, however, may find this to their disliking, due to how the mate itself is almost in the background.<br /><br />All-in-all, this mate blend is perfect for people new to mate teas, or for a connoisseur of mate who doesn't mind the subtle taste of the mate itself. In my opinion, this mate is best served the morning or as a dessert tea.
